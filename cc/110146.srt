00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:38,359
That's a fix.

174
00:14:38,543 --> 00:14:43,334
Fix, fix, fix, fix, fix...

175
00:14:43,565 --> 00:14:47,075
Show's over, girls. Pack your swags
and get back to the humpy.

176
00:14:50,270 --> 00:14:53,333
Hey, hey, Tammy Wynette.
Did you forget something?

177
00:14:53,646 --> 00:14:54,700
Thanks.

178
00:14:54,916 --> 00:14:57,116
And we can get ourselves thrown out
of a pub. Don't need your help.

179
00:14:57,473 --> 00:14:59,894
Thought I told you Abos
to get off my premises.

180
00:14:59,895 --> 00:15:03,718
You were happy enough to have us
sing in your crappy contest.

181
00:15:04,113 --> 00:15:08,137
You can piss off out of the team
and you were a shithouse MC anyhow!

182
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:11,942
Alright, let's not do anything hasty.

183
00:15:12,115 --> 00:15:13,410
Come on. Remember?

184
00:15:13,506 --> 00:15:16,443
I'm the man who made you feel
like a girl of 50 again.

185
00:15:16,649 --> 00:15:19,093
Are you gonna make me fetch my rifle?

186
00:15:22,391 --> 00:15:24,329
Hey, where are you going?

187
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:26,325
I've got something to show you.

188
00:15:26,444 --> 00:15:28,155
Oi! Read this, will you?

189
00:15:28,194 --> 00:15:30,338
Will you just leave me alone?
I think you've caused me enough trouble today.

190
00:15:30,414 --> 00:15:32,271
- I don't know how to read.
- Julie, what are you doing?

191
00:15:35,949 --> 00:15:37,529
"Singers and dancers wanted"

192
00:15:37,598 --> 00:15:40,286
"to perform for the American troops
in Vietnam."

193
00:15:40,358 --> 00:15:42,003
And it says
there's good conditions too.

194
00:15:42,276 --> 00:15:44,538
I thought you didn't know how to
read. - Where'd you get this?

195
00:15:44,623 --> 00:15:46,491
Of course I know
how to read, goatface.

196
00:15:46,656 --> 00:15:48,896
- Then why are you showing me that?
- You need a job, don't you?

197
00:15:49,016 --> 00:15:50,099
We're offering you one.

198
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:51,873
Playing for us in Vietnam.

199
00:15:52,048 --> 00:15:54,334
Yeah, OK. Where's Vietnam?

200
00:15:54,390 --> 00:15:56,430
Hey, Julie, the only place
you're going is home on the bus.

201
00:15:56,471 --> 00:15:58,902
You want to go perform in Vietnam?

202
00:15:58,997 --> 00:16:00,753
What are you going to do?
A corroboree'?

203
00:16:00,887 --> 00:16:03,870
Why not'? We're the best girl group
you'll ever see.

204
00:16:03,990 --> 00:16:06,439
You're the best Aboriginal
girl group I've ever...

205
00:16:06,555 --> 00:16:09,377
you're the only
Aboriginal girl group I've ever seen.

206
00:16:09,491 --> 00:16:13,218
But trust me, girls, singing in
Vietnam'? It's not for you.

207
00:16:13,421 --> 00:16:15,900
Who are you to say
what we can and can't do'?

208
00:16:16,103 --> 00:16:17,751
You're right, I'm sorry.

209
00:16:18,032 --> 00:16:19,428
The years have been unkind.

210
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:21,361
I'm sure you'll do much better.

211
00:16:21,535 --> 00:16:22,997
Good luck.

212
00:16:23,112 --> 00:16:25,565
Comora... comoral...

213
00:16:27,104 --> 00:16:28,727
Good luck, ladies.

214
00:16:34,618 --> 00:16:36,002
No petrol?

215
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:38,391
Hey, this is alright!

216
00:16:38,512 --> 00:16:40,411
30 bucks a week.

217
00:16:42,233 --> 00:16:43,145
OK.

218
00:16:43,195 --> 00:16:48,512
Let's... Just for fun,
let's say that you do go to Vietnam.

219
00:16:48,827 --> 00:16:49,954
What would you sing?

220
00:16:50,078 --> 00:16:52,954
Because this may have escaped
your notice, but you're black.

221
00:16:53,075 --> 00:16:55,998
And you're singing
country and western music.

222
00:16:56,384 --> 00:16:57,738
It's just wrong.

223
00:16:57,945 --> 00:17:00,492
Well, what do you think
we should sing?

224
00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:05,088
90% of all recorded music is shite.

225
00:17:05,165 --> 00:17:08,371
The other 10% is soul.

226
00:17:10,014 --> 00:17:11,514
Soul music.

227
00:17:11,790 --> 00:17:15,192
Otis Redding, Sam Cooke,
that kind of stuff.

228
00:17:15,229 --> 00:17:17,610
- We don't sing that type of stuff.
- We like Charley Pride.

229
00:17:17,930 --> 00:17:20,282
No, not country. Soul!

230
00:17:20,396 --> 00:17:21,738
Not...

231
00:17:21,854 --> 00:17:23,272
Just... boom, boom, boom!

232
00:17:23,383 --> 00:17:26,071
Give me
some of that sweet soul music!

233
00:17:26,185 --> 00:17:27,607
Ladies and gentlemen,

234
00:17:27,728 --> 00:17:32,401
let me introduce you to
the Godfather of Soul, Mr James Brown!

235
00:17:33,784 --> 00:17:35,414
That kind of thing.

236
00:17:35,473 --> 00:17:37,850
If you want to perform
for the brothers in Vietnam,

237
00:17:37,972 --> 00:17:38,894
you've got to give them soul.

238
00:17:39,014 --> 00:17:41,264
What would this duppy
whitefella know about soul music?

239
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:42,375
Hey!

240
00:17:43,221 --> 00:17:47,156
I might be a little pale on the outside,
but my blood runs Negro, woman.

241
00:17:47,385 --> 00:17:49,226
What, the bits that
don't have whisky in them?

242
00:17:49,341 --> 00:17:52,277
I'm not the one up there
playing songs about cowboys.

243
00:17:52,316 --> 00:17:53,322
I like cowboys.

244
00:17:53,684 --> 00:17:56,675
From what I saw,
you could barely play at all.

245
00:17:58,569 --> 00:17:59,698
Ooh.

246
00:18:00,937 --> 00:18:02,077
Give me the number.

247
00:18:02,187 --> 00:18:04,584
You'd better hold your ears,

248
00:18:04,784 --> 00:18:07,382

Us?

260
00:18:43,985 --> 00:18:46,178
Without me, there's no you.

261
00:18:46,383 --> 00:18:49,272
You're gonna to have
to talk to Mum, now?

262
00:18:50,504 --> 00:18:51,945
Happy to talk to Mum.

263
00:18:52,967 --> 00:18:56,102

Vietnam? There's a war in Vietnam!

271
00:19:16,313 --> 00:19:17,390
It's true.

272
00:19:17,547 --> 00:19:20,172
They're having some problems
over there at the minute,

273
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:26,047
but I'd imagine that the girls would
be miles away from any of the fighting.

274
00:19:26,567 --> 00:19:29,162
And there'd be armed guards, of course.

275
00:19:29,466 --> 00:19:33,865
Marines whose sole task
it would be to watch over the girls.

276
00:19:33,995 --> 00:19:37,623
And who's watching over the
Marines? - Mum, just listen to him.

277
00:19:37,904 --> 00:19:39,310
He's got us an audition in
Melbourne.

278
00:19:39,504 --> 00:19:42,582
- Well, who is he'? I don't know him!
- He works at the pub in town.

279
00:19:42,709 --> 00:19:44,959
- Not anymore.
- Julie's right.

280
00:19:45,081 --> 00:19:49,331
I have managed to secure the girls
an audition in Melbourne.

281
00:19:49,452 --> 00:19:52,248
When someone
with my musical pedigree calls

282
00:19:52,367 --> 00:19:54,524
"and says, “Hey, Lovelace here."

283
00:19:54,634 --> 00:19:57,330
"Hey, Dave, how's it going?"Good."

284
00:19:57,444 --> 00:19:59,187
You know, we small talk 'cause
we're comfortable with each other.

285
00:19:59,242 --> 00:20:01,305
But then I say,
"Hey, I've got a group."

286
00:20:01,745 --> 00:20:04,092
"Bring them down, Dave.
We want to see 'em."

287
00:20:05,254 --> 00:20:06,765
You're gonna manage them, are ya?

288
00:20:06,953 --> 00:20:07,974
And mould them.

289
00:20:08,687 --> 00:20:11,216
And shape them.

290
00:20:11,328 --> 00:20:12,672
What about our jobs?

291
00:20:12,898 --> 00:20:14,349
Our jobs are gammin.

292
00:20:14,538 --> 00:20:18,264
OK, Gail,
the two things to remember here...

293
00:20:18,591 --> 00:20:19,971
there's the money...

294
00:20:21,166 --> 00:20:22,186
and there's the Soul Man.

295
00:20:22,803 --> 00:20:24,907
Nah. No way.

296
00:20:25,723 --> 00:20:27,808
If you think I'm gonna let you girls
gallivant around Melbourne,

297
00:20:27,915 --> 00:20:28,776
up to no good...

298
00:20:28,858 --> 00:20:29,454
Mum.

299
00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:32,601
Maybe he's right.

300
00:20:33,265 --> 00:20:35,694
Maybe this is the chance of a lifetime.

301
00:20:35,768 --> 00:20:37,187
What's wrong with your life now'?

302
00:20:37,259 --> 00:20:40,548
Being treated like dogs by the gubs
in town every single day.

303
00:20:40,605 --> 00:20:42,078
That's not the life I was born for.

304
00:20:42,162 --> 00:20:44,719
- I'm destined for fame.
- We can stay at Uncle Ed's.

305
00:20:45,305 --> 00:20:47,011
Move over, Aretha.

306
00:20:47,263 --> 00:20:48,849
Stand back, Wilson Pickett.

307
00:20:49,323 --> 00:20:52,797
Pack your bags, Supremes,
because there are some new cats in town.

308
00:20:52,930 --> 00:20:56,470
And those cats go by the name
of the Crunjuaberry Currants.

309
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:59,393
The Cunner... Cummarendens.

310
00:21:01,405 --> 00:21:04,062
The... We're going to have to
think about your name.

311
00:21:04,301 --> 00:21:06,118
Get up, you moron.

312
00:21:06,639 --> 00:21:07,764
Mum.

313
00:21:11,405 --> 00:21:13,312
I suppose Gail and Cynthia can go.

314
00:21:13,918 --> 00:21:15,838
But Julie stays here.
She's too young.

315
00:21:15,917 --> 00:21:16,934
That's stupid!

316
00:21:17,043 --> 00:21:19,120
Everyone knows
they're nothing without me.

317
00:21:19,197 --> 00:21:21,917
- Julie, that's enough now.
- You've got a child.

318
00:21:22,081 --> 00:21:23,876
And you're no more
than a child yourself.

319
00:21:23,923 --> 00:21:26,626
I know I've got a child. That's why
I want to make something of myself.

320
00:21:26,803 --> 00:21:29,913
- Get out of my face, four eyes.
- Hold on, hold on.

321
00:21:30,095 --> 00:21:33,359
Julie's the key.
Julie's the one with the voice.

322
00:21:33,446 --> 00:21:35,639
- Yeah, I am.
- You are not.

323
00:21:36,257 --> 00:21:37,597
You should ask Kay.

324
00:21:38,776 --> 00:21:39,830
Who's Kay?

325
00:21:40,436 --> 00:21:42,546
Kay's their cousin.

326
00:21:42,716 --> 00:21:46,017
She lives down in Melbourne somewhere,
but I wouldn't know where.

327
00:21:46,115 --> 00:21:47,444
I do.

328
00:21:47,573 --> 00:21:49,848
What? Since when?

329
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:51,267
Long enough.

330
00:21:52,382 --> 00:21:55,928
Kay and them girls used to sing
together once upon a time.

331
00:21:56,174 --> 00:21:58,749
Time that girl came back to us,
anyway.

332
00:21:58,834 --> 00:22:00,108
Dave?

333
00:22:01,473 --> 00:22:03,317
Step into my office, will you?

334
00:22:09,428 --> 00:22:10,888
Go on, then.

335
00:22:11,017 --> 00:22:12,329
Yep.

336
00:22:15,786 --> 00:22:17,942
So, Mr Soul Man...

337
00:22:18,943 --> 00:22:21,010
you reckon you're the real thing,
do you?

338
00:22:21,129 --> 00:22:22,434
Probably not.

339
00:22:23,722 --> 00:22:25,634
Your daughters are the real thing, though.

340
00:22:26,452 --> 00:22:28,485
You a murderer?

341
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:30,143
No, sir.

342
00:22:30,930 --> 00:22:34,168
I was an entertainments officer
on a cruise ship.

343
00:22:34,596 --> 00:22:35,789
Not anymore, though.

344
00:22:37,127 --> 00:22:38,963
I had some problems.

345
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:44,482
You know, you can always tell where
a fish has been by cutting open its guts.

346
00:22:44,645 --> 00:22:47,142
But you've gotta have
the right knife for it.

347
00:22:48,233 --> 00:22:51,078
Always like to keep my blade
really sharp.

348
00:22:53,734 --> 00:22:57,913
I will lay down my life before
I let any harm befall those girls.

349
00:22:58,030 --> 00:22:59,316
You'd better.

350
00:23:00,915 --> 00:23:02,827
Don't worry about Julie.

351
00:23:03,585 --> 00:23:05,068
She's a prize catch?

352
00:23:05,142 --> 00:23:07,245
- Isn't she, though?
- Mmm.

353
00:23:10,618 --> 00:23:16,019
And, ladies, this design fits...
stacks beautifully in the fridge or the pantry.

354
00:23:16,136 --> 00:23:18,039
- Coffee, anyone?
- Yes, please.

355
00:23:18,151 --> 00:23:21,174
It makes great lunchboxes
and things like that.

356
00:23:28,261 --> 00:23:29,636
Come on.

357
00:23:38,490 --> 00:23:40,272
Kay? Are you in there?

358
00:23:49,365 --> 00:23:51,268
Howdy!

359
00:23:51,378 --> 00:23:52,632
Gail.

360
00:23:53,715 --> 00:23:55,408
Cynthia.

361
00:23:57,322 --> 00:23:58,817
You should have let me know.

362
00:24:00,986 --> 00:24:02,895
What do you want?

363
00:24:03,215 --> 00:24:04,559
If it's money, I can't.

364
00:24:04,659 --> 00:24:06,134
Kay? Are you alright?

365
00:24:06,399 --> 00:24:08,075
Won't be a moment.

366
00:24:08,318 --> 00:24:09,838
Are we coming in, or what?

367
00:24:09,952 --> 00:24:11,751
It's not really convenient
at the moment.

368
00:24:11,869 --> 00:24:12,991
I've guests.

369
00:24:13,104 --> 00:24:15,418
Yeah. We make you shame, do we?

370
00:24:15,887 --> 00:24:17,865
Jeez, you haven't changed one bit,
have you'?

371
00:24:17,974 --> 00:24:21,161
Still talking like some upper-class
gub and we're your personal slaves.

372
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:22,178
I don't know what you mean.

373
00:24:22,294 --> 00:24:23,456
Gubba.

374
00:24:23,575 --> 00:24:25,157
It means 'white person'.

375
00:24:25,272 --> 00:24:28,252
- I think you'd better go.
- Kay?

376
00:24:28,652 --> 00:24:30,109
Can I help you?

377
00:24:31,224 --> 00:24:32,058
No.

378
00:24:32,174 --> 00:24:34,995
- Kay, do you know these people?
- I'll handle this.

379
00:24:35,485 --> 00:24:38,305
Kay, we're going to Haysia.

380
00:24:38,489 --> 00:24:39,328
- What?
- Where?

381
00:24:39,523 --> 00:24:40,697
Haysia!

382
00:24:40,815 --> 00:24:42,626
- Thailand.
- Vietnam, you twit.

383
00:24:42,697 --> 00:24:43,613
Vietnam, then.

384
00:24:43,815 --> 00:24:46,837
Well, don't get lost.

385
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:48,816
We need you, cuz.

386
00:24:49,034 --> 00:24:52,101
We're going to be doing shows
for the soldiers in Thai...

387
00:24:52,193 --> 00:24:53,774
Vietnam.

388
00:24:53,918 --> 00:24:55,038
Singing.

389
00:24:55,161 --> 00:24:57,769
But it's gotta be all three of us.

390
00:24:57,864 --> 00:24:59,428
Like when we were kids.

391
00:25:00,084 --> 00:25:01,619
You're wasting your breath.

392
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:03,375
She's lost, that one.

393
00:25:03,489 --> 00:25:05,418
Act your age, not your colour.

394
00:25:05,512 --> 00:25:07,355
Jeez! I don't know you two!

395
00:25:07,473 --> 00:25:11,137
Youse mob better punch on or something,
but sort it out, whatever it is,

396
00:25:11,238 --> 00:25:12,713
'cause this is my big break!

397
00:25:12,834 --> 00:25:14,309
Cynthia!

398
00:25:15,493 --> 00:25:17,215
Your friend's screeching for you.

399
00:25:20,201 --> 00:25:22,645
Kay?

400
00:25:22,723 --> 00:25:24,754
We're staying at uncle Ed's, Kay.

401
00:25:29,491 --> 00:25:31,303
Welcome, welcome all.

402
00:25:31,379 --> 00:25:32,818

Drink, go on.

00:26:39,197 --> 00:26:41,758
and then you've got
little ventilating holes.

430
00:26:42,193 --> 00:26:43,503
Gail!

431
00:26:43,896 --> 00:26:45,770
Gail, it's your mum!

432
00:26:47,101 --> 00:26:49,543
I'm... I'm quite...
Here she is. Here she is.

433
00:26:49,664 --> 00:26:50,553
Mum?

434
00:26:50,883 --> 00:26:52,117
Mum?

435
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:53,087
What's wrong?

436
00:26:53,140 --> 00:26:55,342
That flamin' Julie's run off
somewhere.

437
00:26:55,422 --> 00:26:56,878
What? Mum!

438
00:26:57,351 --> 00:26:58,868
What? What's up?

439
00:26:59,156 --> 00:27:01,866
- Don't you "What upme.
- Mum? What did you say?

440
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:03,556
You've let Julie run off to
Melbourne, haven't you?

441
00:27:03,674 --> 00:27:04,928
Stop your rot.

442
00:27:05,077 --> 00:27:06,500
We'll took after your boy.

443
00:27:06,619 --> 00:27:08,523
Mum? Will someone talk to mel?

444
00:27:08,790 --> 00:27:11,120
Your dad and Nan
helped Julie escape.

445
00:27:11,437 --> 00:27:13,224
Where's that James Brown fella?

446
00:27:13,726 --> 00:27:15,243
- Gail?
- Hey.

447
00:27:15,349 --> 00:27:16,864
Where is he? Gail?

448
00:27:16,941 --> 00:27:19,058
You never told me
that your uncle was Irish.

449
00:27:19,110 --> 00:27:21,812
- Gail!
- We try to hide that.

450
00:27:25,274 --> 00:27:26,642
- Hello?
- I'll get it.

451
00:27:29,224 --> 00:27:30,594
Julie!

452
00:27:30,738 --> 00:27:32,773
Hey, sis!

453
00:27:33,055 --> 00:27:34,855
What's she doing here?

454
00:27:41,322 --> 00:27:43,312
I'm here to sing.

455
00:27:43,529 --> 00:27:45,271
Dad and Nan said I could come.

456
00:27:45,431 --> 00:27:46,800
Did they, now'?

457
00:27:46,993 --> 00:27:48,158
They didn't tell me.

458
00:27:53,595 --> 00:27:55,133
What do you want?

459
00:27:55,363 --> 00:27:57,242
I'm coming to Vietnam.

460
00:27:57,407 --> 00:27:58,628
Who says we want you?

461
00:27:58,706 --> 00:28:02,854
Right - if you say no Julie
and you say no Kay,

462
00:28:02,901 --> 00:28:04,158
then there's no Cynthia.

463
00:28:04,244 --> 00:28:07,092
And if there's no Cynthia,
there's no show.

464
00:28:07,255 --> 00:28:08,760
Bust you, then.

465
00:28:09,728 --> 00:28:13,388
Love and affection
to the bone...

466
00:28:16,936 --> 00:28:19,584
Soul sister.

467
00:28:19,801 --> 00:28:22,149
Brown sugar.

468
00:28:23,568 --> 00:28:27,084
Keep on sockin' it to me
all night long.

469
00:28:32,687 --> 00:28:34,945
Soul sister.

470
00:28:36,162 --> 00:28:38,966
Brown sugar.

471
00:28:40,778 --> 00:28:43,251
Love and affection to the bone.

472
00:28:43,513 --> 00:28:45,260
To the bone.

473
00:28:45,369 --> 00:28:47,841
Soul sister.

474
00:28:48,003 --> 00:28:50,430
Brown sugar...

475
00:28:55,041 --> 00:28:56,842
Well, that was interesting, wasn't it?

476
00:28:58,507 --> 00:29:00,558
Where do we rehearse?

477
00:29:09,647 --> 00:29:12,369
I thought those biscuits
were for patients only, Bruce.

490
00:29:51,223 --> 00:29:53,578
OK - next time you do it,

491
00:29:54,221 --> 00:29:56,851
can you make it sound blacker?

Manage that, Kay?

493
00:29:58,923 --> 00:30:01,624
Alright. Let's go again.
'Grapevine'.

494
00:30:01,874 --> 00:30:05,206
This time, Julie,
can you sing the lead, please?

495
00:30:05,315 --> 00:30:06,746
What?

496
00:30:06,851 --> 00:30:08,010
No, no, no.

497
00:30:08,195 --> 00:30:09,434
I'm Gail.

498
00:30:09,724 --> 00:30:10,479
- That's right.
- Yeah, my name's Gail.

499
00:30:10,547 --> 00:30:14,494
I sing lead.
Julie and the girls do back-ups.

500
00:30:14,989 --> 00:30:17,633
How do you feel about not singing lead?

501
00:30:18,368 --> 00:30:20,888
How do you feel about
getting knocked out by a woman?

502
00:30:21,476 --> 00:30:23,917
Pretty embarrassed, I would imagine.

503
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:28,597
The thing is, Gail, I pick the songs
and I pick who sings them.

504
00:30:28,781 --> 00:30:32,501
Nobody tells me or my sisters
what to sing or who sings lead.

505
00:30:34,489 --> 00:30:37,009
Your voice isn't good enough
to sing lead.

506
00:30:38,601 --> 00:30:39,921
You want to say that again?

507
00:30:39,993 --> 00:30:42,244
Not really. No.

508
00:30:43,931 --> 00:30:47,994
Gail, you are a commanding presence,

509
00:30:48,108 --> 00:30:50,669
on stage as you are in life.

510
00:30:50,772 --> 00:30:54,401
But you also have the weakest voice
out of the four of you.

511
00:30:57,300 --> 00:30:58,578
He's right, Gail.

512
00:30:59,553 --> 00:31:02,091
You can hold a tune but
you can't hold your own in a solo.

513
00:31:03,746 --> 00:31:05,307
Sometimes.

514
00:31:05,537 --> 00:31:07,229
More than sometimes.

515
00:31:08,087 --> 00:31:10,726
Anyone else? Cynthia?

516
00:31:11,072 --> 00:31:14,151
Maybe you should just let
those of us who can do it, do it.

517
00:31:21,565 --> 00:31:23,043
Yeah, OK, then.

518
00:31:24,543 --> 00:31:26,694
- Gail, that's very...
- Shut up. I'm not finished.

519
00:31:30,928 --> 00:31:32,213
I'm finished.

520
00:31:33,303 --> 00:31:34,412
Alright.

521
00:31:34,736 --> 00:31:36,494
Before we go again...

522
00:31:37,143 --> 00:31:38,174
Girls,

523
00:31:38,367 --> 00:31:41,617
when I met you, you were doing
your whole country and western thing

524
00:31:41,665 --> 00:31:43,617
and that's fine - we all make
mistakes.

525
00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:46,563
But here's where we learn
from that mistake.

526
00:31:47,202 --> 00:31:50,812
Country and western music is
about loss.

527
00:31:50,890 --> 00:31:53,686
Soul music is also about loss.

528
00:31:53,770 --> 00:31:55,812
But the difference is,
in country and western music,

529
00:31:56,710 --> 00:32:00,626
they've lost, they've given up and they're
just at home whining about it.

530
00:32:00,743 --> 00:32:02,399
In soul music,

531
00:32:02,656 --> 00:32:04,374
they're struggling to get it back

532
00:32:04,441 --> 00:32:05,812
and they haven't given up,

533
00:32:05,908 --> 00:32:08,663
so every note
that passes through your lips

534
00:32:08,701 --> 00:32:11,053
should have the tone of a woman
who's grasping and fighting

535
00:32:11,116 --> 00:32:13,866
and desperate to retrieve
what's been taken from her.

536
00:32:13,973 --> 00:32:15,390
You understand?

537
00:32:15,533 --> 00:32:19,168

searching for, that's up to you.

00:41:17,698 --> 00:41:20,730
to seeing you sweethearts showcase
your talent on stage tonight.

691
00:41:20,905 --> 00:41:21,840
Tonight?

692
00:41:22,334 --> 00:41:23,671
Well, listen up, honey.

693
00:41:24,396 --> 00:41:25,660
I got 32 acts.

694
00:41:25,715 --> 00:41:27,290
Five of them are soul sisters.

695
00:41:27,406 --> 00:41:30,276
If you can't shake your money maker
for the brothers tonight,

696
00:41:30,410 --> 00:41:32,583
you're all on the first plane
back to Austria tomorrow.

697
00:41:33,075 --> 00:41:34,148
Australia.

698
00:41:34,248 --> 00:41:35,253
The first plane.

699
00:41:35,645 --> 00:41:37,127
Fear not, brother Myron.

700
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:40,606
I know my girls can lay it down.

701
00:41:41,957 --> 00:41:45,916
And, sister, the singing -
it ain't the half of it.

702
00:41:46,252 --> 00:41:49,640
The show - it better be right on.

703
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:54,764
If the pool's gonna be on the roof,
it's gonna be up this way.

704
00:41:54,939 --> 00:41:57,728
Are you sure we're allowed up here?
Isn't it just for the soldiers?

705
00:41:57,787 --> 00:41:59,086
Yes, Julie.

706
00:41:59,194 --> 00:42:02,084
I can smell where the good-looking
men are from a mile away.

707
00:42:02,186 --> 00:42:03,999
You're over Jimmy Middleton now'?

708
00:42:04,156 --> 00:42:07,051
Don't mention his name.
He's had his go.

709
00:42:07,118 --> 00:42:10,043
He's not getting a second serve
of this coffee-coloured Koori.

710
00:42:12,694 --> 00:42:16,148
He's in Cummeragunja, I'm in Saigon.
I can do what I like.

711
00:42:24,411 --> 00:42:25,590
Kay!

712
00:42:26,117 --> 00:42:27,340
Need ya!

713
00:42:27,649 --> 00:42:29,231
Kay!

714
00:42:33,270 --> 00:42:33,873
<i>Sorry...</i>

715
00:42:43,851 --> 00:42:46,202
We're looking for the pool.

716
00:42:46,820 --> 00:42:48,913
You'll find the pool thataways.

717
00:42:49,513 --> 00:42:50,366
OK.

718
00:42:53,543 --> 00:42:55,116
I work in a hospital.

719
00:42:59,000 --> 00:42:59,832
Kay!

720
00:43:28,564 --> 00:43:31,360
Now, we've got four real-life
Aborigines from Australia

721
00:43:31,446 --> 00:43:33,792
and they're gonna be putting it down
out there for you tonight.

722
00:43:33,878 --> 00:43:35,819
So I want you to be polite.

723
00:43:35,944 --> 00:43:38,156
Grab a drink off my beautiful ladies

724
00:43:38,236 --> 00:43:40,499
because we've got a big line-up
for y'all tonight.

725
00:43:40,554 --> 00:43:41,929
And remember,

726
00:43:42,140 --> 00:43:45,960
you're at the Cave, baby,
the best black bar in Saigon.

727
00:43:46,172 --> 00:43:47,775
Yeah.

728
00:43:50,221 --> 00:43:52,924
- Let's do it. Yeah?
- Yeah. Alright.

729
00:43:52,982 --> 00:43:53,978

We've just got to remember to keep
in step in the choruses, that's all.

770
00:45:55,091 --> 00:45:57,317
6:00 in the morning,
front of the hotel there.

771
00:45:57,352 --> 00:46:00,618
The Sapphires hit the road and
you tighten up the act out of town.

772
00:46:00,675 --> 00:46:03,784
We're gonna tour the Sapphires
for three headline-busting weeks.

773
00:46:03,826 --> 00:46:06,451
That's 27 shows in 23 days.

774
00:46:06,543 --> 00:46:11,238
And then we play the big venues -
Nha Trang and back here in Saigon.

775
00:46:11,293 --> 00:46:13,029
- You dig?
- Right on.

776
00:46:13,155 --> 00:46:15,022
Hey, back up the truck, brother.

777
00:46:15,140 --> 00:46:17,768
There are things we need to discuss,
like a military escort.

778
00:46:17,886 --> 00:46:20,470
You're four black women in
a war zone, honey.

779
00:46:20,588 --> 00:46:23,344
Now, all you need to do is sing.

780
00:46:23,434 --> 00:46:26,034
Myron, we don't pass wind
without a military escort.

781
00:46:26,203 --> 00:46:27,503
Come on, Dave.

782
00:46:27,551 --> 00:46:29,554
Do you think I'd be sending
my stars out on the road

783
00:46:29,582 --> 00:46:32,024
without the might of the
US military to protect them?

784
00:46:32,058 --> 00:46:33,461
What about a band?

785
00:46:33,530 --> 00:46:35,337
You've been singing with
them right there, sister.

786
00:46:35,566 --> 00:46:37,100
Look, I'm leaving this up to you,
white boy.

787
00:46:37,298 --> 00:46:39,020
Don't screw this up on me.

788
00:46:39,178 --> 00:46:40,617
I don't screw up, Myron.

789
00:46:41,251 --> 00:46:43,257
Just go get the dresses.

790
00:46:43,517 --> 00:46:46,494
You've got to look me in the eyes.
It's bad luck.

791
00:46:49,001 --> 00:46:51,529
Hey, sister. Remember me?
On the rooftop?

792
00:46:51,607 --> 00:46:53,032
- It's Kay, right?
- Ah!

793
00:46:53,084 --> 00:46:54,273
Ooh! Chill out, chill out.

794
00:46:54,314 --> 00:46:56,745
- Oooh! Shame.
- He's yours.

795
00:46:58,981 --> 00:47:01,339
So, you got plans for tonight?

796
00:47:01,392 --> 00:47:02,676
Are you always this clumsy?

797
00:47:02,718 --> 00:47:04,722
No, ma'am. Only around beauty.

798
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:08,741
Oh, better watch your step, then.

799
00:47:09,192 --> 00:47:10,309
Alright.

800
00:47:11,164 --> 00:47:12,450
Name's Robby.

801
00:47:14,482 --> 00:47:15,969
Goodnight, Robby.

802
00:47:17,175 --> 00:47:19,910
Hey, it's all groovy, baby.
You've work to do.

803
00:47:20,049 --> 00:47:22,532
We'll save the pleasure of meeting
for another time.

804
00:47:22,681 --> 00:47:26,158
But, hey, don't you forget now.
Whoo!

805
00:47:26,202 --> 00:47:27,329
(CRASH)

806
00:47:27,668 --> 00:47:30,206
Ooh. Chill out, chill out.
Chill out. Chill out.

807
00:47:31,731 --> 00:47:33,302
It's all groovy, baby.

808
00:47:33,389 --> 00:47:35,056
They still working.

809
00:47:37,771 --> 00:47:39,056
Seriously, now, honey?

810
00:47:39,171 --> 00:47:41,835
Never relax. Never assume.

811
00:47:44,324 --> 00:47:47,168
That party girl there in the
miniskirt could be Vietcong.

812
00:47:48,553 --> 00:47:50,952
She could lob a hand grenade
across the bar at any time.

813
00:47:51,471 --> 00:47:52,899
Boom!

814
00:47:55,772 --> 00:47:57,365
If you've got to do that,

815
00:47:57,408 --> 00:47:59,752
can you do that somewhere else
where we don't have to watch you?

816
00:48:00,923 --> 00:48:04,014
Hey, sis, if you want something,
you've got to go get it.

817
00:48:04,082 --> 00:48:07,387
Yeah, well, can you get it
somewhere else? I can hear you.

818
00:48:09,082 --> 00:48:10,555
Where's Julie?

819
00:48:10,661 --> 00:48:12,925
She went that way.

820
00:48:22,028 --> 00:48:23,820
There you are.

821
00:48:23,984 --> 00:48:25,677
What are you doing out here?

822
00:48:25,888 --> 00:48:28,038
I need to know where you are
at all times.

823
00:48:28,116 --> 00:48:29,861
I didn't know
it was going to be like this.

824
00:48:30,420 --> 00:48:33,752
Anyone could lob a hand grenade
and start shooting at us.

825
00:48:34,142 --> 00:48:35,324
There you are.

826
00:48:35,350 --> 00:48:36,282
What did I tell you?
You shouldn't even be here.

827
00:48:36,328 --> 00:48:37,861
Shouting at me isn't gonna help.

828
00:48:37,980 --> 00:48:40,008
Yeah, well, it's your stupid idea
in the first place, isn't it'?

829
00:48:40,125 --> 00:48:42,359
Julie, darling.

830
00:48:42,567 --> 00:48:45,084
Don't worry.
Everything's going to be fine.

831
00:48:45,370 --> 00:48:47,034
Can you not stick your nose in it?

832
00:48:47,131 --> 00:48:48,923
Jesus Christ.

833
00:48:49,808 --> 00:48:52,684
Look, Gail, if I could think of a
way to insult a black woman

834
00:48:52,753 --> 00:48:54,354
without coming across as racist...

835
00:48:54,433 --> 00:48:56,689
Well, if you can't,
it probably means you are.

836
00:48:56,759 --> 00:48:58,599
Will you just shut up?

837
00:48:59,596 --> 00:49:01,011
Look, you know what? That's it.

838
00:49:01,252 --> 00:49:02,739
We're going to have this out,
you and me.

839
00:49:03,468 --> 00:49:05,627
Come on, bud. Let's go.

840
00:49:05,749 --> 00:49:08,008
Fine. Here and now.

841
00:49:08,357 --> 00:49:10,834
This shit - this has to stop.

842
00:49:10,948 --> 00:49:13,409
You're going to have to start giving
me the respect that I deserve.

843
00:49:13,505 --> 00:49:14,633
Respect?

844
00:49:14,815 --> 00:49:16,768
What are you,
the ﬂaming mission manager?

845
00:49:16,812 --> 00:49:18,850
Yes! I'm the manager.

846
00:49:18,912 --> 00:49:22,879
I am the man who's going to manage you
better than you've ever been managed!

847
00:49:23,004 --> 00:49:25,892
It would take a special man
to manage me properly.

848
00:49:25,927 --> 00:49:27,430
Well, you're looking at him!

849
00:49:27,707 --> 00:49:30,520

Hell no. This is what you call
cooking, Cajun-style.

889
00:52:09,779 --> 00:52:12,446
This here's my famed
blackened catfish.

890
00:52:12,664 --> 00:52:15,041
It's the speciality of the house.

891
00:52:19,289 --> 00:52:20,314
Hot!

892
00:52:20,405 --> 00:52:21,859

893
00:52:21,928 --> 00:52:23,289
Dave, I'm telling you,

894
00:52:23,349 --> 00:52:25,207
ain't nothing surer with the ladies

895
00:52:25,276 --> 00:52:28,028
than a man packing
a home-baked spread of catfish

896
00:52:28,150 --> 00:52:29,851
and a side order of soul.

897
00:52:30,190 --> 00:52:31,264
Right, brother.

898
00:52:33,040 --> 00:52:35,986
First question.
Are you attracted to the man or not?

899
00:52:36,198 --> 00:52:38,799
A little.
I wouldn't say he's my one and only.

900
00:52:40,007 --> 00:52:43,442
That's what Stevie Kayne said to me
and I ended up with Hartley.

901
00:52:43,579 --> 00:52:45,743
Stevie Kayne's the father of your
child?

902
00:52:45,863 --> 00:52:47,496
Stevie with the glasses?

903
00:52:47,742 --> 00:52:50,882

1017

Government fellas.

01:00:19,567 --> 01:00:21,521
Mum and Dad screaming at us.

1023
01:00:26,053 --> 01:00:28,985
I don't get it. What did they want?

1024
01:00:29,480 --> 01:00:30,804
The children.

1025
01:00:32,121 --> 01:00:35,184
It's my responsibility, Dave,
to look after the little ones

1026
01:00:35,298 --> 01:00:36,531
because I'm the oldest.

1027
01:00:36,637 --> 01:00:37,902
Hurry UP!

1028
01:00:38,015 --> 01:00:41,151
I'm not to let them out of my sight,
especially not Kay.

1029
01:00:41,244 --> 01:00:42,362
<i>Why Kay'?</i>

1030
01:00:42,714 --> 01:00:45,403
If you have fair
skin like Kay,

1031
01:00:45,552 --> 01:00:47,826
them fellas reckon
she could <i>pass</i> for white.

1032
01:00:47,912 --> 01:00:49,083
- Get out of the way!
- Leave them kids alone!

1033
01:00:49,153 --> 01:00:50,571
Take her from her family,

1034
01:00:50,675 --> 01:00:53,862
put her in an institution,
teach her white ways.

1035
01:00:53,973 --> 01:00:57,725
Pretty soon, there'll be no
blackfellas left to worry about.

1036
01:00:57,899 --> 01:00:58,402
Kay.

1037
01:00:58,558 --> 01:01:01,979
And then, um, Kay got sick.

1038
01:01:02,118 --> 01:01:04,158
I mean real sick.

1039
01:01:05,560 --> 01:01:10,896
We're scared it's pneumonia
<i>so</i> we take her to town, to hospital...

1040
01:01:13,018 --> 01:01:18,348
and... and that's when we find out
them government fellas have been back.

1041
01:01:18,409 --> 01:01:19,257
Where's Kay?

1042
01:01:19,342 --> 01:01:21,471
They've taken Kay from the hospital bed.

1043
01:01:21,566 --> 01:01:24,381
You've got to speak to me!
Say something to me!

1044
01:01:24,442 --> 01:01:26,050
Where's my baby little girl?

1045
01:01:26,252 --> 01:01:28,258
Where's Kay gone?

1046
01:01:28,945 --> 01:01:30,774
- Speak to me!
- "Kay."

1047
01:01:30,862 --> 01:01:32,463
Say something to me!

1048
01:01:32,543 --> 01:01:33,739
"Where are you, Kay?"

1049
01:01:33,843 --> 01:01:35,710
No, I won't stop!

1050
01:01:35,857 --> 01:01:37,272
"Where's my girl?"

1051
01:01:37,349 --> 01:01:39,039
Where's Kay gone?!

1052
01:01:40,219 --> 01:01:43,322
You know, we didn't see Kay
till her mum died.

1053
01:01:43,646 --> 01:01:46,232
They let her come home for the
funeral.

1054
01:01:46,545 --> 01:01:49,028
And all she could say
in all that time...

1055
01:01:49,151 --> 01:01:53,515
If you people worked as much <i>as</i> you
fished, you'd be really rich, you know?

1056
01:01:53,635 --> 01:01:57,819
And I've never been able to forgive
her, or myself.

1057
01:02:08,681 --> 01:02:10,370
We should dance.

1058
01:02:12,465 --> 01:02:13,967
What?

1059
01:02:14,922 --> 01:02:16,637
It's a good time to dance.

1060
01:02:17,152 --> 01:02:19,072
Nuh.

1061
01:02:19,296 --> 01:02:20,353
Come on.

1062
01:02:20,492 --> 01:02:22,408
I'll show you how to
shake your moom.

1063
01:02:22,511 --> 01:02:25,855
Yeah-no, I've seen you shake your
moom. It's not pretty.

1064
01:02:25,915 --> 01:02:29,301
I'm gonna teach you
the Lovelace Lanky Leg Shuffle.

1065
01:02:29,414 --> 01:02:31,390
No. If I start
dancing like you,

1066
01:02:31,572 --> 01:02:33,343
the brothers there
might think I'm a gubba.

1067
01:02:33,395 --> 01:02:36,052
I see. You're saying because
I'm white, I can't dance. Is that it?

1068
01:02:36,254 --> 01:02:39,016
- Yep.
- Well, that's just racist.

1069
01:02:39,435 --> 01:02:40,735
You're a racist.

1070
01:02:40,975 --> 01:02:42,441
You should know better.

1071
01:02:44,057 --> 01:02:45,398
Come on.

1072
01:02:46,644 --> 01:02:48,842
Just watch and learn.
Don't be afraid.

1073
01:02:50,375 --> 01:02:52,048
It's all about the shoulders.

1074
01:02:52,580 --> 01:02:56,704
They don't belong to me,
they belong to the music in my head.

1075
01:02:59,981 --> 01:03:01,689
- Nuh.
- Deadly.

1076
01:03:01,754 --> 01:03:05,630
When we use that word, 'deadly',
it usually means something's good.

1077
01:03:05,898 --> 01:03:07,149
Ooh.

1078
01:03:12,850 --> 01:03:15,114
You know, Gail, there's
a funny thing about you.

1079
01:03:15,205 --> 01:03:17,500
Everybody thinks
that you're just this...

1080
01:03:18,018 --> 01:03:20,393
this mouth on legs...

1081
01:03:21,051 --> 01:03:25,175
this defensive,
argumentative old witch.

1082
01:03:25,513 --> 01:03:26,889
Stick with me.

1083
01:03:27,004 --> 01:03:31,834
There's a reason
that you're this... terrible mouth,

1084
01:03:31,958 --> 01:03:34,333
and it's very simple.

1085
01:03:36,686 --> 01:03:38,231
You're mama bear...

1086
01:03:40,386 --> 01:03:42,226
and they're your little baby cubs.

1087
01:03:50,991 --> 01:03:53,457
You been drinking?

1088
01:03:53,807 --> 01:03:55,398
No.

1089
01:03:59,426 --> 01:04:01,766
Come on, then,
you silver-tongued wannabe.

1090
01:04:02,764 --> 01:04:04,415
I'll dance with ya.

1091
01:04:09,478 --> 01:04:11,023
Let me lead.

1092
01:04:11,785 --> 01:04:13,501

Huh?

1133
01:07:00,172 --> 01:07:01,922
Me and the guys
will be leaving you folks today.

1134
01:07:02,027 --> 01:07:03,453
I just have to say
it's been a real pleasure.

1135
01:07:03,497 --> 01:07:05,709
What? You're leaving us here?
On our own?

1136
01:07:05,832 --> 01:07:09,002
- Not if I had my way, ma'am.
- How do we get to our next gig?

1137
01:07:09,382 --> 01:07:10,664
I...

1138
01:07:12,546 --> 01:07:14,308
Sorry, ma'am. I thought you knew.

1139
01:07:14,369 --> 01:07:16,746
The military's approved the use
of a vehicle for you.

1140
01:07:19,190 --> 01:07:20,940
In that?

1141
01:07:21,056 --> 01:07:22,771
What about the band?

1142
01:07:23,116 --> 01:07:26,404
Ma'am, I understand your band
is being pulled out also.

1143
01:07:29,864 --> 01:07:31,213
Dave?

1144
01:07:36,831 --> 01:07:40,163
Myron, hi. Listen, it's Dave.
What's happening, bro'?

1145
01:07:40,244 --> 01:07:42,873
They've taken away our military
escort and our backing band.

1146
01:07:42,943 --> 01:07:43,758
I can't accept that.

1147
01:07:43,863 --> 01:07:45,885
Dave, we've already talked about this.

1148
01:07:45,946 --> 01:07:48,567
Wait. When?

1149
01:07:48,609 --> 01:07:50,984
Last week on the phone.

1150
01:07:51,029 --> 01:07:53,963
Don't screw this up on me!
Do you hear me'?

1151
01:07:54,049 --> 01:07:56,089
Now, a colleague of mine,
Lou McGary,

1152
01:07:56,176 --> 01:07:57,648
is touring from the States.

1153
01:07:57,770 --> 01:08:00,816
Some big names.
He wants to hear Julie sing.

1154
01:08:00,933 --> 01:08:02,934
Man, I think we got us a star
in the making here.

1155
01:08:03,108 --> 01:08:05,154
- What's so special about Julie?
- Shh!

1156
01:08:05,198 --> 01:08:06,207
You need to get yourselves
to Nha Trang.

1157
01:08:06,599 --> 01:08:08,541
I'm gonna get Lou
on a military flight.

1158
01:08:08,654 --> 01:08:10,346
We got to get Julie
in front of this guy.

1159
01:08:10,477 --> 01:08:14,279
Myron, explain to me how we're gonna
gig without Hendo and the band.

1160
01:08:14,383 --> 01:08:16,044
- Where's Hendo and the band?
- Shh!

1161
01:08:16,160 --> 01:08:18,499
Man, forget about them, man.
They're out of the picture.

1162
01:08:18,614 --> 01:08:21,589
We got a 10-piece in Nha Trang
that's nothing but class, baby.

1163
01:08:21,710 --> 01:08:23,732
No, wait, wait... Myron, wait.

1164
01:08:23,939 --> 01:08:26,100
Julie could put us on the map,
stateside.

1165
01:08:26,173 --> 01:08:27,124
You dig what I'm saying?

1166
01:08:27,202 --> 01:08:29,076
Now, you want to stand
in the way of success?

1167
01:08:29,142 --> 01:08:30,736
Then you go right ahead.

1168
01:08:31,005 --> 01:08:32,515
No, Myron...

1169
01:08:33,468 --> 01:08:34,763
Myron?

1170
01:08:36,188 --> 01:08:37,731
My...?

1171
01:08:38,243 --> 01:08:40,117
- You don't remember, do ya?
- I do. I...

1172
01:08:40,724 --> 01:08:42,189
Um...

1173
01:08:43,259 --> 01:08:44,428
It's coming back to me.

1174
01:08:44,537 --> 01:08:46,286
He said...

1175
01:08:46,461 --> 01:08:50,727
something about,
you know, Nha Trang and, um...

1176
01:08:51,071 --> 01:08:52,390
What?

1177
01:08:53,103 --> 01:08:56,122
How smashed were you
when you let Myron talk you into this?

1178
01:08:58,442 --> 01:09:00,113
I'm sorry.

1179
01:09:00,879 --> 01:09:02,874
Yeah. Sure.

1180
01:09:14,638 --> 01:09:18,579
Sir, you might find a use for this.

1181
01:09:24,501 --> 01:09:26,590
You'd better give that to me.

1182
01:09:37,949 --> 01:09:39,772
Bye, ladies.

1183
01:09:40,848 --> 01:09:42,224
Good luck!

1184
01:10:00,608 --> 01:10:04,434
Truly, Cyn.
I can't see how he's a great loss.

1185
01:10:04,560 --> 01:10:07,560
All Hendo did was feed you booze
and drugs and take advantage of ya.

1186
01:10:07,680 --> 01:10:10,020
Gail, there isn't a soldier
in Vietnam

1187
01:10:10,135 --> 01:10:12,179
who isn't stoned out of his brain all the time.

1188
01:10:12,296 --> 01:10:15,045
Yeah, well, don't forget he had a wife.

1189
01:10:15,167 --> 01:10:18,042
- How do you know'?
- Cyn, there's always a wife.

1190
01:10:18,162 --> 01:10:19,582
Not always.

1191
01:10:21,407 --> 01:10:23,371
Dave, you're not married, are you?

1192
01:10:23,488 --> 01:10:25,077
What?

1193
01:10:27,730 --> 01:10:29,525
- Are you married?
- What?

1194
01:10:29,644 --> 01:10:31,768
"What?Are you married?

1195
01:10:31,890 --> 01:10:33,559
No.

1196
01:10:37,298 --> 01:10:38,888
Yes.

1197
01:10:41,823 --> 01:10:44,009
Seriously, Dave.
the big conda kill you?

1198
01:10:44,321 --> 01:10:47,480
I bloody will

1199
01:11:08,720 --> 01:11:10,655
Hey, Julie. Can you come here for a sec?

1200
01:11:10,773 --> 01:11:12,204
This is the guy I want you to meet.

1201
01:11:12,325 --> 01:11:14,258
His name is Lou McGary, OK?

1202
01:11:14,378 --> 01:11:17,525
Hey, Lou. This is Julie McCrae.

1203
01:11:17,646 --> 01:11:21,972
Lou-Lou, miss.
I have heard so much about you.

1204
01:11:22,090 --> 01:11:23,692
She's got some pipes on her, Lou.

1205
01:11:23,806 --> 01:11:25,821
- Wait till you hear this girl.

1206
01:11:25,944 --> 01:11:28,005

What the heck was that all about?

1229
01:13:11,767 --> 01:13:13,465
She's right.
You're making us look like crap.

1230
01:13:13,585 --> 01:13:15,745
What's your problem?
They love me out there.

1231
01:13:15,814 --> 01:13:17,281
Maybe you should just
pull it back a bit.

1232
01:13:17,550 --> 01:13:19,321
Now let's get back on stage.

1233
01:13:19,598 --> 01:13:21,924
Nuh. Not with her.

1234
01:13:22,063 --> 01:13:25,669
You've been drinking, Cyn,
and there's too much at stake tonight.

1235
01:13:26,148 --> 01:13:29,307
What are you doing? Sacking me?

1236
01:13:29,574 --> 01:13:31,824
- Dave?
- I'll decide.

1237
01:13:31,945 --> 01:13:33,757
I think we should all decide.

1238
01:13:33,983 --> 01:13:36,364
I... I.
Cyn, we should all decide.

1239
01:13:37,793 --> 01:13:41,350
Cyn, we're doing it without ya.

1240
01:13:41,462 --> 01:13:45,005
Right? Decision made.

1241
01:13:47,302 --> 01:13:48,728
Gail.

1242
01:13:53,605 --> 01:13:56,069
I'll make you proud of me, bub.

1243
01:14:02,066 --> 01:14:05,119
Gail? Gail? Hold on one sec.

1244
01:14:05,174 --> 01:14:07,167
I just wanted to say I...

1245
01:14:07,474 --> 01:14:09,514
I thought you dealt with that
really well.

1246
01:14:09,780 --> 01:14:12,810
No, I mean it - you know,
it was a tough call

1247
01:14:13,040 --> 01:14:16,200
and you're obviously
getting really good at this.

1248
01:14:17,583 --> 01:14:21,834
Gail, the whole marriage thing,
it's probably not as bad as it sounds.

1249
01:14:21,879 --> 01:14:23,535
I mean it. Listen...

1250
01:14:23,665 --> 01:14:28,211
there's me with, like,
a house and a wife

1251
01:14:28,266 --> 01:14:32,897
and me not yet 21 and her no lover of
the rock'n'roll and I'm out on the rip.

1252
01:14:33,216 --> 01:14:39,423
It was an unholy alliance but I
probably should have mentioned it.

1253
01:14:41,131 --> 01:14:44,275
- Yeah, you should have.
- Wait, wait, Gail, before you go.

1254
01:14:44,369 --> 01:14:48,490
I wanted to talk to you about
something

1255
01:14:48,955 --> 01:14:50,931
so I wrote it down.

1256
01:14:52,363 --> 01:14:56,415
No, the thing is, Gail...

1257
01:14:59,462 --> 01:15:01,778
I was never good enough.

1258
01:15:02,739 --> 01:15:06,504
I was never good enough at music...

1259
01:15:06,938 --> 01:15:10,210
and certainly
not at life and that's a...

1260
01:15:10,280 --> 01:15:12,710
That's a hard thing to take...

1261
01:15:15,548 --> 01:15:17,047
because I didn't have a place

1262
01:15:17,188 --> 01:15:21,548
and then I met
these crazy Aboriginal girls

1263
01:15:21,730 --> 01:15:23,334
and one amazing woman

1264
01:15:23,392 --> 01:15:26,764
and I had a place and I liked it.

1265
01:15:29,298 --> 01:15:34,330
So if I've ruined all of that,
then I'm an idiot.

1266
01:15:36,114 --> 01:15:37,655
But you knew that already.

1267
01:15:41,150 --> 01:15:45,610
No, don't look at it now.
For the love of God. Just....

1268
01:15:45,766 --> 01:15:48,596
read it when I'm not around.

1269
01:15:52,678 --> 01:15:54,426
I'm sorry.

1270
01:15:56,044 --> 01:15:57,588
I'm sorry.

1271
01:16:13,661 --> 01:16:16,455
Get down!

1272
01:16:18,816 --> 01:16:21,110
- What's happening?!
- We're under attack!

1273
01:16:21,230 --> 01:16:23,977
We're calling in the sharpers.

1274
01:16:24,099 --> 01:16:25,769
- What?
- We're gonna get you out of here.

1275
01:16:25,887 --> 01:16:27,682
Let's go.

1276
01:16:27,800 --> 01:16:30,093
You three, with me. Get over there.

1277
01:16:32,530 --> 01:16:34,574
Go, go! Get to the chopper!

1278
01:16:36,574 --> 01:16:38,244
Keep moving! Keep moving!

1279
01:16:41,520 --> 01:16:42,985
Gail!

1280
01:16:55,579 --> 01:16:57,543
Go! Move it, move it, move it!

1281
01:17:00,485 --> 01:17:03,324
Inside. Get in. Go!

1282
01:17:03,439 --> 01:17:05,029
Where's Julie and Kay?

1283
01:17:05,144 --> 01:17:07,233
OK, I gotta go get the girls.

1284
01:17:12,297 --> 01:17:13,966
Julie!

1285
01:17:14,083 --> 01:17:15,083
Kay!

1286
01:17:28,390 --> 01:17:30,059
Dave!

1287
01:17:32,008 --> 01:17:33,302
Dave!

1288
01:17:39,783 --> 01:17:41,578
- I need your help.
- Shit!

1289
01:17:41,697 --> 01:17:43,287
Didn't you say you had
medical experience?

1290
01:17:43,401 --> 01:17:44,366
Here, hold this.

1291
01:17:44,483 --> 01:17:46,607
I clean a hospital.
I don't think it counts.

1292
01:17:46,729 --> 01:17:48,602
Then you can clean up here.

1293
01:17:49,113 --> 01:17:51,584
Get your nigger hands off me.

1294
01:17:55,171 --> 01:17:57,589
Keep that black dog away from me.

1295
01:18:24,313 --> 01:18:27,890
Shhh.

1296
01:18:51,075 --> 01:18:58,348
Now, I know it might seem
a little odd that I write a letter

1297
01:18:58,696 --> 01:19:02,715
but certain things
are best said from a distance,

1298
01:19:02,846 --> 01:19:06,620
especially when you're addressing
a woman who thinks she's Cassius Clay.

1299
01:19:08,174 --> 01:19:13,027
Gail, from the moment we got
kicked out of that pub together,

1300
01:19:13,077 --> 01:19:16,038
I knew you were someone
I wanted in my life.

1301
01:19:16,659 --> 01:19:21,553
Someone to fight the good fight
with, and often against.

1302
01:19:22,439 --> 01:19:26,527
You just had something and
I knew it.

1303
01:19:26,635 --> 01:19:30,178
Don't ask me how or why
because I couldn't tell you.

1304
01:19:30,242 --> 01:19:31,780
All I know is,

1305
01:19:31,907 --> 01:19:35,973
like the first time I heard Otis
Redding sing 'These Arms of Mine'...

1306
01:19:36,787 --> 01:19:39,476
I knew life would never
be the same again.

1307
01:19:42,196 --> 01:19:44,717
And this is the effect
that you've had on me, Gail.

1308
01:19:45,017 --> 01:19:48,788
So, that being said...

1309
01:19:51,059 --> 01:19:52,796
it would be a great honour

1310
01:19:52,850 --> 01:19:55,715
if you would allow me
to become part of your family.

1311
01:19:57,267 --> 01:20:01,736
I would be proud to call
your sisters my <i>sisters</i>

1312
01:20:01,973 --> 01:20:05,296
and your mother my mother

1313
01:20:05,559 --> 01:20:09,454
and your family my family.

1314
01:20:09,557 --> 01:20:11,410
Get to the point, blast it.

1315
01:20:11,498 --> 01:20:15,385
I guess what I'm saying is,
will you marry me?

1316
01:20:15,803 --> 01:20:21,696
Once I've sorted my other little situation out,
will you marry me then?

1317
01:20:22,966 --> 01:20:24,917
There, I've said it.

1318
01:20:24,973 --> 01:20:26,818
Well, I've written it.

1319
01:20:26,903 --> 01:20:30,212
You don't have to answer
straightaway.

1320
01:20:30,349 --> 01:20:34,664
I don't mind waiting
until we get back home.

1321
01:20:35,130 --> 01:20:38,948
Anyway, I love you.

1322
01:20:47,775 --> 01:20:51,142
I have some
very sad news for all of you

1323
01:20:51,287 --> 01:20:55,762
and I think sad news
for all of our fellow citizens

1324
01:20:55,914 --> 01:20:59,616
and people who love peace
all over the world,

1325
01:21:00,135 --> 01:21:05,900
and that is that Martin Luther King was shot
and was killed tonight in Memphis.

1326
01:21:06,564 --> 01:21:09,264
A single shot
took the life of Dr King

1327
01:21:09,668 --> 01:21:13,900
as he stood on the balcony
of the Lorraine Motel in Memphis.

1328
01:21:15,329 --> 01:21:17,881
(NEWSREADER)
Martin Luther King...

1329
01:21:17,943 --> 01:21:20,392
(NEWSREADER)]
He dedicated his life

1330
01:21:21,745 --> 01:21:24,466
(NEWSREADER)
To love...  and to justice

1331
01:21:24,643 --> 01:21:27,097
(NEWSREADER)
between fellow human beings.

1332
01:21:27,367 --> 01:21:31,377
(NEWSREADER)
He died in the course of that effort.

1333
01:21:31,511 --> 01:21:36,032
Let me tell you how it is for
a black Marine in Saigon tonight.

1334
01:21:36,805 --> 01:21:40,027
His home is burning
and here he sits in hell

1335
01:21:40,141 --> 01:21:43,527
while his brothers and sisters
are dying in the streets.

1336
01:21:44,046 --> 01:21:46,892
It's reasonable to assume
that he might begin to question

1337
01:21:46,911 --> 01:21:49,070
what the hell he's fighting for.

1338
01:21:50,287 --> 01:21:54,526
These Marines, they need something.

1339
01:21:54,861 --> 01:21:58,306
They need what you can provide,
and they need it tonight.

1340
01:21:58,593 --> 01:22:02,578
I know you're hurting
but I need you to sing.

1341
01:22:02,904 --> 01:22:06,361
Gail, are we gonna do this?

1342
01:22:08,475 --> 01:22:09,872
Excuse me, you want something?

1343
01:22:09,928 --> 01:22:12,261
Excuse me, sir,
I have phone call for her.

1344
01:22:17,536 --> 01:22:19,106
Hello?

1345
01:22:21,889 --> 01:22:23,416
It's Mum.

1346
01:22:24,641 --> 01:22:27,594
Mum, how did you know where
to find us?

1347
01:22:27,774 --> 01:22:30,294
That Dave fella fixed it
all last week.

1348
01:22:30,666 --> 01:22:32,574
He's a deadly fella, that one.

1349
01:22:32,615 --> 01:22:35,421
You give him a big kiss for me.

1350
01:22:35,586 --> 01:22:36,394
Yeah.

1351
01:22:39,317 --> 01:22:41,045
Auntie Gerry?

1352
01:22:41,203 --> 01:22:43,121
It's me, Kay.

1353
01:22:43,630 --> 01:22:45,343
You're a good girl, bub.

1354
01:22:45,545 --> 01:22:47,590
Your mum would be so proud of ya.

1355
01:22:48,376 --> 01:22:49,909
Cyn.

1356
01:22:52,909 --> 01:22:54,796
I made the biggest mistake of
my life, Cyn.

1357
01:22:54,927 --> 01:22:56,350
- Jimmy?
- I want to fix it.

1358
01:22:56,521 --> 01:22:58,833
Well, you should've
thought about that before?

1359
01:22:59,189 --> 01:23:01,836
I've got fellas lining up
to suck my ring off

1360
01:23:01,913 --> 01:23:04,332
so put Mum back on the phone
and leave me alone, blast ya.

1361
01:23:11,888 --> 01:23:13,808
You know what I want to hear.

1362
01:23:23,547 --> 01:23:31,716
And I've looked
over and I've seen the promised land.

1363
01:23:32,323 --> 01:23:40,074
I may not get there with you but I want you
to know tonight that we as a people

1364
01:23:40,135 --> 01:23:42,858
will get to the promised land.

1365
01:23:43,683 --> 01:23:45,244
So I'm happy tonight.

1366
01:23:45,307 --> 01:23:47,272
I'm not worried about anything.

1367
01:23:47,328 --> 01:23:49,792
I'm not fearing any man.

1368
01:23:49,852 --> 01:23:54,454
