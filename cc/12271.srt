1
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:39,136
My great, great, great...

2
00:00:39,170 --> 00:00:42,537
great uncle was a signer
of the Declaration of Independence,

3
00:00:42,574 --> 00:00:46,066
and my mother's side started building
New York before the Revolution.

4
00:00:46,111 --> 00:00:48,944
You get the idea.

5
00:00:58,390 --> 00:01:01,791
I went to a party once and there was
a palm reader there.

6
00:01:03,495 --> 00:01:05,554
When she looked at my hand,
She just-

7
00:01:05,597 --> 00:01:08,464
She froze.

8
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:10,491
And I said to her,
"I know.

9
00:01:10,535 --> 00:01:13,436
My life line is broken.

10
00:01:13,471 --> 00:01:17,168
I know I won't live
past 30."

11
00:01:24,315 --> 00:01:26,545
You know those photos
of smiling families

12
00:01:26,584 --> 00:01:28,745
you always see
on a mantelpiece?

13
00:01:31,389 --> 00:01:33,880
I can't even look at them,

14
00:01:33,925 --> 00:01:36,155
because you never know
what they're hiding.

15
00:01:39,497 --> 00:01:42,432
A "Life Magazine" photographer
came to our house

16
00:01:42,467 --> 00:01:46,062
to photograph
the "ideal American family. "

17
00:01:46,104 --> 00:01:49,870
We looked happy
and pretty,

18
00:01:49,908 --> 00:01:53,537
but underneath

19
00:01:53,578 --> 00:01:56,445
it just wasn't
that way at all.

20
00:02:10,728 --> 00:02:12,821
Looks like the country
is disintegrating.

21
00:02:12,864 --> 00:02:14,855
Lost all its hope.

22
00:02:14,899 --> 00:02:18,665
There's always hope no matter
what's happened before.

23
00:02:18,703 --> 00:02:21,069
Yeah?

24
00:02:21,106 --> 00:02:22,869
Where's the hope in that?

25
00:02:22,913 --> 00:02:25,143
God, wouldn't it be wonderful
to know that students

26
00:02:25,182 --> 00:02:28,015
were looking at your work,
analyzing it?

27
00:02:28,051 --> 00:02:29,746
That depends on
what they're saying.

28
00:02:31,955 --> 00:02:34,753
I mean, people say
he's a no-talent freak.

29
00:02:34,792 --> 00:02:38,193
He's changing the way
that we look at the world, isn't he?

30
00:02:38,228 --> 00:02:40,788
I think people
who manage to do that

31
00:02:40,831 --> 00:02:43,561
must have the hardest
time in life.

32
00:02:46,036 --> 00:02:49,062
Are you sure you'll be okay
in New York?

33
00:02:49,106 --> 00:02:51,734
I'll be fine. I've got Chuck
to look after me.

34
00:02:53,577 --> 00:02:56,740
Oh, Syd, why won't
you come too?

35
00:02:56,780 --> 00:02:59,044
My folks would kill me.

36
00:02:59,082 --> 00:03:02,313
Where I come from,
it's not easy to get a scholarship.

37
00:03:04,888 --> 00:03:07,288
You know, I'm not so sure
about Chuck.

38
00:03:07,324 --> 00:03:10,020
He can be a real
shit sometimes.

39
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:11,550
Don't worry.

40
00:03:15,632 --> 00:03:17,099
Edie!

41
00:03:21,638 --> 00:03:24,334
Chuckie, how can you want to go home?
We're in Manhattan.

42
00:03:24,374 --> 00:03:27,400
To become an artist,
I had to get out of that classroom.

43
00:03:27,444 --> 00:03:30,811
And to me New York was Jackson
Pollock sipping vodka

44
00:03:30,848 --> 00:03:33,874
and dripping paint
over a raw canvas.

45
00:03:33,917 --> 00:03:36,681
There's so much to see, Chuck.
Look where we are.

46
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,847
Yeah, taking
New York by storm.

47
00:03:38,889 --> 00:03:40,584
Two zombies.

48
00:03:40,624 --> 00:03:43,184
Chuck and I had come down
together from Cambridge.

49
00:03:43,227 --> 00:03:45,354
You know, he was
a flamboyant socialite

50
00:03:45,395 --> 00:03:47,761
who carried a pocketful
of calling cards.

51
00:03:47,798 --> 00:03:50,824
He made me feel
I wasn't alone.

52
00:03:50,868 --> 00:03:52,995
- Can we play the game?
- I don't want to.

53
00:03:53,036 --> 00:03:54,867
- Come on.
- All right, go.

54
00:03:54,905 --> 00:03:56,736
- Lamb.
- Chop.

55
00:03:56,773 --> 00:03:58,104
- Pony.
- Snout.

56
00:03:58,141 --> 00:04:00,371
- Shy.
- You.

57
00:04:00,410 --> 00:04:03,641
- You think I'm shy?
- Sometimes.

58
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:07,309
I guess I can
be shy sometimes.

59
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:12,684
Forgive me, Father,
for I have sinned.

60
00:04:12,723 --> 00:04:16,159
What are your sins, my son?

61
00:04:16,193 --> 00:04:19,128
Well, I have this
friend Mark.

62
00:04:19,162 --> 00:04:22,359
Well, he buys all these clothes
from Bloomingdale's.

63
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:24,492
But because he's from London,
everybody on the Cape

64
00:04:24,535 --> 00:04:26,628
keeps talking about
his "fabulous English look,"

65
00:04:26,670 --> 00:04:29,230
which really is so good.

66
00:04:29,273 --> 00:04:31,707
He was at a party
up there last weekend

67
00:04:31,742 --> 00:04:35,200
and Norman Mailer walked up
and punched him in the stomach.

68
00:04:35,245 --> 00:04:37,179
When Mark asked him why,

69
00:04:37,214 --> 00:04:39,546
he just said it was
"for wearing a pink coat. "

70
00:04:39,583 --> 00:04:41,915
I know I should have
been happy for Mark

71
00:04:41,952 --> 00:04:43,613
that Norman Mailer
punched him,

72
00:04:43,654 --> 00:04:46,555
but all I could think was,
"Will Norman Mailer ever punch me?"

73
00:04:48,899 --> 00:04:52,665
Andy, why do you come
to confession?

74
00:04:52,702 --> 00:04:56,194
Well, because
it's a sin not to.

75
00:05:22,865 --> 00:05:25,060
Edie, come on now.

76
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:26,795
It's going to be over
by the time you're done.

77
00:05:26,835 --> 00:05:28,530
You're not even
going to meet him.

78
00:05:32,774 --> 00:05:35,436
We're going to be late.
Very late.

79
00:05:47,924 --> 00:05:51,485
I just don't understand. Why are
Jasper's selling and mine are not?

80
00:05:53,134 --> 00:05:55,432
I wonder if Picasso
knows who I am yet.

81
00:05:55,453 --> 00:05:57,751
Andy, what are you doing
here all by yourself?

82
00:05:59,866 --> 00:06:02,096
How's the movie business?

83
00:06:02,135 --> 00:06:04,194
Oh, well, it's busy,
but I wouldn't call it a business.

84
00:06:04,237 --> 00:06:06,068
I haven't made
any money off of it yet.

85
00:06:06,105 --> 00:06:08,369
Of course you haven't, Andy.

86
00:06:08,408 --> 00:06:10,342
The movie business
is the most fickle in the world.

87
00:06:10,376 --> 00:06:12,173
- You know that.
- Oh.

88
00:06:12,211 --> 00:06:16,375
Listen, I have met
the most remarkable lady.

89
00:06:16,416 --> 00:06:18,850
- Oh.
- Old money- very old.

90
00:06:18,885 --> 00:06:21,479
Oh good, does she want
to buy a painting? Who is she?

91
00:06:28,795 --> 00:06:30,854
Oh, thank you.
Oh!

92
00:06:30,897 --> 00:06:34,492
That's her.
That's Edie Sedgwick.

93
00:06:34,534 --> 00:06:36,331
Oh.

94
00:06:36,369 --> 00:06:38,929
What good manners. Chuckie,
pay attention to these gentlemen.

95
00:06:38,971 --> 00:06:40,939
You just might
learn something.

96
00:06:40,973 --> 00:06:44,500
Oh, wow.
She's so beautiful.

97
00:06:44,544 --> 00:06:47,104
It's like a morgue in here. Please.

98
00:06:47,146 --> 00:06:48,738
Her father struck
oil out west.

99
00:06:48,781 --> 00:06:52,774
She escaped to art school
in Cambridge or somewhere.

100
00:06:52,819 --> 00:06:55,310
Made her way
down here last year.

101
00:06:55,354 --> 00:06:57,481
She's done some modeling.

102
00:06:57,523 --> 00:06:59,184
Tried to get
into a gallery,

103
00:06:59,225 --> 00:07:01,750
but no one has ever seen
anything she's done.

104
00:07:01,794 --> 00:07:05,628
When you said "old money,"
you made her sound 50.

105
00:07:13,339 --> 00:07:16,172
- Is that the Andy Warhol?
- Mm-hmm.

106
00:07:16,209 --> 00:07:18,143
- Want to meet him?
- Of course.

107
00:07:18,177 --> 00:07:20,042
Edie, this is Andy.

108
00:07:20,079 --> 00:07:22,138
Hi.

109
00:07:22,181 --> 00:07:24,149
Oh, it's just amazing
to meet you.

110
00:07:24,183 --> 00:07:26,708
- I think you're just a genius.
- Oh.

111
00:07:26,753 --> 00:07:29,347
No one is doing anything
like you right now

112
00:07:29,388 --> 00:07:32,084
and that in itself is a sign
of brilliance, don't you think?

113
00:07:32,102 --> 00:07:33,797
But I'd love you to be
in one of my movies.

114
00:07:34,910 --> 00:07:37,879
And what would I have to do
in one of your movies?

115
00:07:37,913 --> 00:07:41,076
Just be yourself.

116
00:07:41,116 --> 00:07:43,550
Well which one?

117
00:07:43,559 --> 00:07:46,153
You're the boss,
applesauce.

118
00:07:47,375 --> 00:07:50,833
Andy, in your films,
what are you hoping to do?

119
00:07:50,878 --> 00:07:53,108
We're just trying
to make it so bad,

120
00:07:53,147 --> 00:07:55,012
but doing it well.

121
00:07:55,049 --> 00:07:58,450
You know, where you get the most
scratches you can on a film.

122
00:07:58,486 --> 00:08:00,215
Or all the dirt
you can get on a film.

123
00:08:03,257 --> 00:08:06,818
Or zooming badly,

124
00:08:06,861 --> 00:08:09,591
where you zoom and you
hit the most important-

125
00:08:09,631 --> 00:08:11,360
miss the most
important thing.

126
00:08:11,399 --> 00:08:14,095
And, uh...

127
00:08:15,570 --> 00:08:17,265
your camera jiggles

128
00:08:17,305 --> 00:08:20,536
so that everybody knows
you're watching a film.

129
00:08:20,575 --> 00:08:23,635
How do you work
with your actors then?

130
00:08:23,678 --> 00:08:25,509
What do you tell them?

131
00:08:29,384 --> 00:08:32,512
Well, I don't like
to tell them what to do.

132
00:08:32,553 --> 00:08:36,421
I mean, I just think
people are so interesting.

133
00:08:37,759 --> 00:08:40,250
Some say your work
is pornographic.

134
00:08:40,294 --> 00:08:43,752
Oh, yeah.

135
00:08:43,798 --> 00:08:46,164
Isn't that great?

136
00:09:00,181 --> 00:09:01,512
So...

137
00:09:01,549 --> 00:09:04,416
do you work in hay?

138
00:09:04,452 --> 00:09:07,319
Oh yeah,
we're making a cowboy movie.

139
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,711
Who are all these people?

140
00:09:40,755 --> 00:09:43,189
Oh.

141
00:09:43,224 --> 00:09:44,885
- That's Rotten Rita.
- Now turn for me.

142
00:09:44,926 --> 00:09:47,895
And Silver George,
Debbie Dropout,

143
00:09:47,929 --> 00:09:49,954
the Turtle.

144
00:09:49,997 --> 00:09:51,692
I don't know who that is.

145
00:09:51,733 --> 00:09:54,668
Who's that?

146
00:09:54,702 --> 00:09:56,727
This is Ondine and Brigid.

147
00:09:56,771 --> 00:09:59,205
- This is Chuck and Edie.
- Hello.

148
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:01,674
Andy, I got a new book
to draw in.

149
00:10:01,709 --> 00:10:04,303
It said on the front,
"The Topical Bible. "

150
00:10:04,345 --> 00:10:06,336
I didn't know what the theme
should be, so I thought,

151
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:09,907
"What rhymes with topical?"
And then I started rhyming.

152
00:10:09,951 --> 00:10:13,216
Topical, bopical...
and then I got to "C."

153
00:10:13,254 --> 00:10:17,088
Cockical. I mean, it's perfect, right?
An entire book about cocks.

154
00:10:17,125 --> 00:10:19,059
Yeah, that's great.

155
00:10:19,093 --> 00:10:20,617
Her last book
was called "Scars,"

156
00:10:20,661 --> 00:10:23,129
but "Cocks" has a nicer ring to it,
don't you think?

157
00:10:23,164 --> 00:10:24,828
Hmm.

158
00:10:24,873 --> 00:10:27,933
Ooh, maybe we can get
the President's.

159
00:10:27,976 --> 00:10:30,706
Oh yeah,
Johnson's johnson.

160
00:10:30,745 --> 00:10:32,645
Brigid, you got to
call your father.

161
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:35,376
Are you insane, Andy? You know what
my father would say to me?

162
00:10:35,416 --> 00:10:37,475
- Maybe he'd want to be in the book.
- Yeah.

163
00:10:37,518 --> 00:10:40,385
Brigid's father has an empire.
He's very rich.

164
00:10:40,421 --> 00:10:43,288
Oh, you should do your cock
for the book too.

165
00:10:45,907 --> 00:10:47,704
Hey, Andy,
we're ready.

166
00:10:49,877 --> 00:10:52,209
Oh, we're gonna do the movie.
You want to see?

167
00:10:52,246 --> 00:10:55,545
I can give him a tranquilizer.

168
00:10:55,583 --> 00:10:58,177
Tranquilizer?
I'll take one of those, Mary.

169
00:10:58,219 --> 00:11:00,244
Will you put
the microphone in lower

170
00:11:00,288 --> 00:11:03,587
so we can see it?
Yeah, neat.

171
00:11:05,126 --> 00:11:07,287
- Have you used one before?
- No.

172
00:11:07,328 --> 00:11:09,558
It's easy.
Why don't you turn it on?

173
00:11:09,597 --> 00:11:12,862
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

174
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:15,767
Andy Warhol's "Horse. "

175
00:11:20,842 --> 00:11:22,707
Which one of you
has a gun?

176
00:11:25,146 --> 00:11:27,376
Which one of you has a gun?

177
00:11:27,415 --> 00:11:29,781
Look at the size of it.

178
00:11:29,817 --> 00:11:32,911
Ooh, look at that gun.

179
00:11:32,954 --> 00:11:36,446
- I want to ride it on the prairie.
- I bet you do.

180
00:11:36,490 --> 00:11:38,856
- You've seen bigger, yeah?
- No, of course not.

181
00:11:38,893 --> 00:11:40,224
- Except once or twice.
- Hello?

182
00:11:40,261 --> 00:11:42,252
We're doing a movie.

183
00:11:42,996 --> 00:11:46,090
- Easy, horsie.
- Whoa.

184
00:11:46,433 --> 00:11:48,298
- Whoa, easy there, boy.
- Oh my.

185
00:11:48,335 --> 00:11:49,570
All right.

186
00:11:50,939 --> 00:11:53,801
Oh, shit!

187
00:11:53,836 --> 00:11:55,401
Shh.

188
00:12:02,551 --> 00:12:04,678
Shh.

189
00:12:20,101 --> 00:12:22,126
What do you think of The Factory?

190
00:12:22,170 --> 00:12:24,536
Do you like it here?

191
00:12:24,572 --> 00:12:27,598
Of course.

192
00:12:27,642 --> 00:12:31,510
I think it's always good to get beyond
your experiences, you know?

193
00:12:31,546 --> 00:12:35,414
And I hate it when people take
themselves too seriously.

194
00:12:35,450 --> 00:12:37,475
- Don't you?
- Oh, yeah.

195
00:12:41,790 --> 00:12:44,281
I read somewhere

196
00:12:44,325 --> 00:12:46,555
that you were born in California.
Is that true?

197
00:12:46,594 --> 00:12:49,586
Yes, but we were
from back East originally.

198
00:12:49,631 --> 00:12:52,930
Well, Fuzzy got sick.

199
00:12:52,967 --> 00:12:56,528
And so he wanted
to move to a warmer climate,

200
00:12:56,571 --> 00:13:00,337
and he bought a ranch
in Santa Barbara, California.

201
00:13:00,375 --> 00:13:02,468
And that's
where I was born.

202
00:13:02,510 --> 00:13:05,172
Who's Fuzzy?

203
00:13:05,213 --> 00:13:08,444
- Oh, Fuzzy's my father.
- Oh.

204
00:13:08,483 --> 00:13:11,543
My father.
Mm-hmm.

205
00:13:14,255 --> 00:13:16,849
And is Chuck
your best friend?

206
00:13:19,494 --> 00:13:22,054
He's my best girlfriend.

207
00:13:24,165 --> 00:13:26,133
Who's your best boyfriend?

208
00:13:26,167 --> 00:13:28,692
Oh, that's easy.
That would-

209
00:13:28,736 --> 00:13:30,704
actually,
it's not that easy.

210
00:13:32,574 --> 00:13:35,543
I would have to say
my brother Minty.

211
00:13:35,577 --> 00:13:39,206
Oh, well, you should
bring him over.

212
00:13:41,015 --> 00:13:43,108
I can't.
I wish I could.

213
00:13:46,087 --> 00:13:48,214
He's dead.

214
00:13:55,530 --> 00:13:58,966
Who is the first boy
you made it with?

215
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,731
The first boy I made it with
was at Silver Hill.

216
00:14:04,506 --> 00:14:07,236
- The hospital?
- Mm-hmm.

217
00:14:07,275 --> 00:14:10,039
Oh, I hear it's very chic.

218
00:14:10,078 --> 00:14:13,605
Didn't Cornelia Vanderbilt
go there?

219
00:14:13,648 --> 00:14:16,446
All I had to do was walk in

220
00:14:16,484 --> 00:14:19,885
on Fuzzy fucking
our neighbor.

221
00:14:19,921 --> 00:14:22,913
And then when
I told my mother,

222
00:14:22,957 --> 00:14:26,552
well, Fuzzy said
that I was imagining it.

223
00:14:26,594 --> 00:14:28,323
There has to be
another way.

224
00:14:28,363 --> 00:14:31,662
But even after all the pills
that he pumped me up with,

225
00:14:31,699 --> 00:14:34,600
I knew what I saw.

226
00:14:34,636 --> 00:14:37,628
And so he sent me off
to Silver Hill

227
00:14:37,672 --> 00:14:41,108
just like he did with my brothers
Minty and Bobby.

228
00:14:41,142 --> 00:14:45,010
It was sort of
the Sedgwick way.

229
00:14:53,421 --> 00:14:55,446
Who was the first boy you ever kissed?

230
00:14:55,490 --> 00:14:57,219
Fuzzy.

231
00:15:06,558 --> 00:15:08,583
Silver Hill.

232
00:15:08,627 --> 00:15:11,687
I can't take it anymore.

233
00:15:12,930 --> 00:15:14,898
I want to die.

234
00:15:14,932 --> 00:15:17,093
Why do you want to die?

235
00:15:17,134 --> 00:15:20,831
Because my credit's
no good at Bonwit Teller.

236
00:15:20,872 --> 00:15:24,569
Because I just stole
$30 worth of underwear from Bergdorf's,

237
00:15:24,609 --> 00:15:26,440
and I think I might
do it again.

238
00:15:27,912 --> 00:15:30,278
Is that you, Edie?

239
00:15:30,314 --> 00:15:32,441
I thought you might
be lonely on the watch.

240
00:15:32,483 --> 00:15:33,541
Don't lie to Wanda.

241
00:15:33,584 --> 00:15:35,984
- I've known you for too long.
- But really, Wanda,

242
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:37,920
everything is just super.

243
00:15:37,955 --> 00:15:40,355
I met the most
fantastic people.

244
00:15:40,391 --> 00:15:42,188
I went to this gallery.

245
00:15:42,226 --> 00:15:44,751
You know, Roy Lichtenstein
and Jasper Johns

246
00:15:44,795 --> 00:15:47,958
and Andy Warhol.
I may get a show there.

247
00:15:47,999 --> 00:15:51,332
Somebody asked me
to be in a movie, Wand.

248
00:15:51,369 --> 00:15:54,634
Wouldn't you love
to be in a movie?

249
00:15:54,672 --> 00:15:57,072
Are you still seeing a doctor?

250
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:07,988
In today's news,

251
00:16:08,022 --> 00:16:09,922
rioting continued
in Alabama

252
00:16:09,957 --> 00:16:12,016
as civil rights demonstrators converged
on the courthouse steps

253
00:16:12,059 --> 00:16:13,856
in downtown Selma.

254
00:16:13,894 --> 00:16:17,227
Who could grant any wish.

255
00:16:17,264 --> 00:16:19,425
Andy was a little boy

256
00:16:19,466 --> 00:16:22,196
who needed
to be taken care of.

257
00:16:24,371 --> 00:16:27,306
I mean, his mother
moved in with him when he was 22.

258
00:16:27,341 --> 00:16:31,175
As a child, he had this horrible
nervous condition.

259
00:16:31,211 --> 00:16:34,078
- It made him feel like an outsider.
- Thanks, Mama.

260
00:16:39,153 --> 00:16:42,611
I like your Sunday
personality better.

261
00:16:55,803 --> 00:16:57,270
Hello?

262
00:16:57,304 --> 00:16:58,737
- Hello?
- Hello.

263
00:16:58,772 --> 00:17:01,866
Hello.
How are you, dear?

264
00:17:01,909 --> 00:17:03,900
Well, Andy, I'm just about ready
to flip my lid.

265
00:17:03,944 --> 00:17:06,674
Henry Winthorpe llI
just left The Factory.

266
00:17:06,714 --> 00:17:09,308
Oh, the toothpaste heir?
How were his teeth?

267
00:17:09,350 --> 00:17:12,877
Oh, I didn't notice,
but his cock was beautiful.

268
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:15,218
- Was it big?
- Listen.

269
00:17:24,031 --> 00:17:27,057
- Did he know you were taping him?
- He insisted.

270
00:17:27,101 --> 00:17:30,559
Andy, I'm getting
such good tapes.

271
00:17:37,277 --> 00:17:39,609
I don't care if she is wearing
a wig. It's a movie about boys.

272
00:17:39,647 --> 00:17:42,411
- It's supposed to be an all-male cast.
- But Edie looks like a boy.

273
00:17:42,449 --> 00:17:45,543
- Like a beautiful boy.
- And I think she's fantastic.

274
00:17:45,586 --> 00:17:49,022
But she shouldn't be in this.
It throws off the whole concept.

275
00:17:49,056 --> 00:17:51,786
It's supposed to be about thugs
and J.D.s and hooligans.

276
00:17:51,825 --> 00:17:53,952
Oh, I know.
I know.

277
00:17:53,994 --> 00:17:55,655
Is she gonna
say anything,

278
00:17:55,696 --> 00:17:57,857
or is she just gonna sit
there like a mannequin?

279
00:17:57,898 --> 00:17:59,832
I just don't think
she's cut out for this.

280
00:17:59,867 --> 00:18:02,961
Well, Gerard, maybe Edie doesn't think
you're cut out for it either.

281
00:18:03,003 --> 00:18:05,437
"Vinyl," a film by Andy Warhol

282
00:18:05,472 --> 00:18:08,032
starring Gerard Malanga.

283
00:18:29,063 --> 00:18:32,590
I'm a troublemaker. A hooligan.

284
00:18:32,633 --> 00:18:35,295
A real motherfucker.

285
00:18:35,335 --> 00:18:38,395
So if you got a problem,

286
00:18:38,439 --> 00:18:41,931
I can stick it where I can put it
whether you want it or not.

287
00:19:10,370 --> 00:19:13,134
Why is he doing that?

288
00:19:13,173 --> 00:19:15,767
Why doesn't he stop?

289
00:19:33,393 --> 00:19:35,384
In The Factory you were accepted

290
00:19:35,429 --> 00:19:37,363
and encouraged

291
00:19:37,397 --> 00:19:39,695
and even expected
to be different.

292
00:19:39,733 --> 00:19:42,634
Andy made me
feel comfortable,

293
00:19:42,669 --> 00:19:45,729
and I believe that
he felt comfortable with me.

294
00:19:48,075 --> 00:19:51,875
No, I'm serious. Let's say you're
on a TV show like "Steve Allen"

295
00:19:51,912 --> 00:19:54,904
and he says, "So, Edie, any plans
for getting married?"

296
00:19:54,948 --> 00:19:56,813
Okay, fine.

297
00:19:56,850 --> 00:19:59,944
But I could only marry four-
maybe three people.

298
00:19:59,987 --> 00:20:02,547
Who?

299
00:20:02,589 --> 00:20:05,524
The future Earl of Litchfield,
but he'll have to be the last, I think.

300
00:20:05,559 --> 00:20:08,323
- Oh.
- And Mick Jagger.

301
00:20:08,362 --> 00:20:11,388
Oh, yeah.
I hear he has a really big cock.

302
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:15,198
- And then who?
- Nureyev.

303
00:20:15,235 --> 00:20:17,260
But I don't think
he likes women.

304
00:20:17,304 --> 00:20:19,499
Are you allowed
to say that on television?

305
00:20:19,540 --> 00:20:21,735
Oh, Andy, we couldn't say
anything on television.

306
00:20:21,775 --> 00:20:24,403
They'd have to tape
our mouths shut.

307
00:20:26,246 --> 00:20:28,771
It's so much more fun
in New York

308
00:20:28,816 --> 00:20:32,047
since you showed up.

309
00:20:58,412 --> 00:21:01,575
Those were really
the happiest days of my life.

310
00:21:01,615 --> 00:21:04,413
When we were experiencing life
on our own terms.

311
00:21:04,451 --> 00:21:07,682
What better way
to say goodbye

312
00:21:07,721 --> 00:21:10,952
to Edith Minturn Sedgwick,
the Mayflower girl.

313
00:21:16,196 --> 00:21:17,959
Andy, what do you think
of Edie's new look?

314
00:21:17,998 --> 00:21:20,262
It'll be great.
I can't wait to see it.

315
00:21:24,304 --> 00:21:28,001
Andy took ordinary
objects and made them iconic.

316
00:21:28,041 --> 00:21:32,808
I always thought that he was throwing
America back in its face-

317
00:21:32,846 --> 00:21:36,009
you know, turning the assembly
line into a punchline.

318
00:21:47,027 --> 00:21:50,121
Hello?

319
00:21:50,163 --> 00:21:51,562
Andy.

320
00:21:51,598 --> 00:21:53,463
When are you going
to show me your drawings?

321
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:55,695
You've showed them
to Gerard and Brigid.

322
00:21:55,736 --> 00:21:57,795
I want them
to be the right ones.

323
00:21:57,838 --> 00:22:00,500
Well just put anything together.
We'll make a show.

324
00:22:00,540 --> 00:22:03,737
Ileana Sonnabend is coming to New York
next month. I'll introduce you.

325
00:22:03,777 --> 00:22:05,711
Really?

326
00:22:05,746 --> 00:22:07,805
I will.
This weekend I'll-

327
00:22:07,848 --> 00:22:10,749
Oh no, not this weekend. We're supposed
to go to Fire Island, remember?

328
00:22:10,784 --> 00:22:12,513
Well when am I supposed
to get it done?

329
00:22:12,552 --> 00:22:14,520
It'll happen.
I wouldn't worry about it.

330
00:22:14,554 --> 00:22:17,421
That's easy for you to say.
You have nothing to worry about.

331
00:22:17,457 --> 00:22:19,118
Oh, that's not true.

332
00:22:19,159 --> 00:22:21,559
The Sculls cancelled
a whole order of Brillo boxes.

333
00:22:21,595 --> 00:22:24,291
Andy, I know plenty
of people in New York

334
00:22:24,331 --> 00:22:26,561
who are looking
to buy great art.

335
00:22:26,667 --> 00:22:30,159
Edie, I just think
it will clash terribly

336
00:22:30,203 --> 00:22:31,795
with the Biedermeier chairs.

337
00:22:31,838 --> 00:22:33,965
Well you can just say
whatever color you want.

338
00:22:34,007 --> 00:22:36,475
I just picked up a new blue from Pearl
that's fantastic.

339
00:22:36,510 --> 00:22:38,375
Well, Mrs. Shingle,
just so you know,

340
00:22:38,412 --> 00:22:40,380
my mother had one
done last month,

341
00:22:40,414 --> 00:22:42,939
and she was so happy with it
she ordered three more.

342
00:22:42,983 --> 00:22:46,612
Wow, your mother always
did have excellent taste.

343
00:22:46,653 --> 00:22:49,622
Taupe I think
would work best.

344
00:23:03,470 --> 00:23:06,303
I wonder if people
are gonna remember us.

345
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:08,069
What, when we're dead?

346
00:23:08,108 --> 00:23:10,133
Yeah.

347
00:23:10,177 --> 00:23:12,975
I think people will talk about how
you changed the world.

348
00:23:13,013 --> 00:23:15,277
I wonder what
they'll say about you

349
00:23:15,315 --> 00:23:17,510
in your obituary.
I like that word.

350
00:23:17,551 --> 00:23:19,075
Nothing nice, I don't think.

351
00:23:19,119 --> 00:23:21,280
Come on.
It would say...

352
00:23:21,321 --> 00:23:24,051
"Edith Minturn Sedgwick,

353
00:23:24,091 --> 00:23:26,025
beautiful artist
and actress... "

354
00:23:26,059 --> 00:23:28,027
"And all-around loon. "

355
00:23:28,061 --> 00:23:30,529
"Remembered for setting
the world on fire... "

356
00:23:30,564 --> 00:23:33,465
"And escaping the clutches
of her terrifying family. "

357
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:36,799
"Made friends with everybody
and anybody... "

358
00:23:36,837 --> 00:23:40,398
"By creating chaos and uproar
wherever she went.

359
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:42,499
Divorced as many times
as she married,

360
00:23:42,542 --> 00:23:45,102
she leaves only
good wishes behind. "

361
00:23:48,248 --> 00:23:51,411
That's nice, isn't it?

362
00:23:51,451 --> 00:23:54,113
Well, I hope
I die first,

363
00:23:54,154 --> 00:23:56,315
because I would be too sad
if you died before me.

364
00:23:58,592 --> 00:24:01,117
Tell me other places
you lived after that.

365
00:24:01,161 --> 00:24:04,028
I lived in Paris
when I studied art.

366
00:24:04,064 --> 00:24:06,965
The French, they're
just so good looking.

367
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,901
Andy, we should go.

368
00:24:09,936 --> 00:24:13,235
Actually, when I say it it makes sense
for you to be there right now.

369
00:24:13,273 --> 00:24:15,798
But I didn't think
they liked new art anymore.

370
00:24:15,842 --> 00:24:18,538
You just take some of the flower
paintings and the movies,

371
00:24:18,578 --> 00:24:22,275
and they'd appreciate
you so much more than they do here.

372
00:24:22,315 --> 00:24:25,910
You know, here people don't really know
why you do what you do.

373
00:24:25,952 --> 00:24:27,681
But in Paris,
they don't care.

374
00:24:27,721 --> 00:24:30,588
So you're free to express it
however you want.

375
00:24:30,624 --> 00:24:32,455
Well, they only care
that you know why.

376
00:24:32,492 --> 00:24:34,426
Oh, well I just do it
because I'm ugly

377
00:24:34,461 --> 00:24:36,292
and there's nothing
else for me to do.

378
00:24:36,329 --> 00:24:38,695
You're not ugly, Andy.

379
00:24:38,732 --> 00:24:41,724
Well, I do have my good days.

380
00:24:41,768 --> 00:24:44,202
Three shrimp cocktails,

381
00:24:44,237 --> 00:24:45,795
extra lemon,
extra cocktail.

382
00:24:45,839 --> 00:24:48,034
And then I'll have
the salmon grilled. Is it fresh?

383
00:24:48,075 --> 00:24:50,703
- Oh yes, ma'am.
- No butter, but extra parsley.

384
00:24:50,744 --> 00:24:52,769
- Ooh, and lots of Russian dressing.
- $200?

385
00:24:52,813 --> 00:24:54,144
And you?

386
00:24:54,181 --> 00:24:56,445
Oh, I'll just have
a peanut butter sandwich.

387
00:24:56,483 --> 00:24:57,950
I'll see what I can do.

388
00:24:57,984 --> 00:25:00,111
- Put everybody on my tab.
- Yes, ma'am.

389
00:25:00,153 --> 00:25:01,984
I don't understand.
These are all your bills?

390
00:25:02,022 --> 00:25:04,855
I know, they're huge.
You might have to start paying me.

391
00:25:04,891 --> 00:25:08,588
Either that or I'll have to move into
a one-bedroom or a studio.

392
00:25:08,628 --> 00:25:11,222
Oh God, where would
I keep all my clothes in a studio, Andy?

393
00:25:11,264 --> 00:25:13,562
- What should I do?
- Oh, nothing.

394
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:16,797
I just think what you're doing right now
is so glamorous.

395
00:25:16,837 --> 00:25:18,668
- Really?
- Yeah.

396
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:28,673
Darling, where did you get that blouse?
It's simply divine.

397
00:25:28,715 --> 00:25:31,479
- It's Donald Brooks.
- Hmm.

398
00:25:31,518 --> 00:25:35,113
Here, try it on.
We're about the same size.

399
00:25:36,556 --> 00:25:38,353
There I was in the midst of hara-kiri

400
00:25:38,391 --> 00:25:40,222
when it hit me-

401
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:42,490
24 hours in the life
of Edie.

402
00:25:42,529 --> 00:25:45,430
One day.
One movie.

403
00:25:45,465 --> 00:25:48,127
You are so much fun. How come you don't
spend more time with us?

404
00:25:48,168 --> 00:25:51,137
- Because of my lips.
- Your lips?

405
00:25:51,171 --> 00:25:53,696
They have a hard time
kissing Andy Warhol's ass.

406
00:25:53,740 --> 00:25:55,970
- Yeah, that's great.
- Yeah?

407
00:25:56,009 --> 00:25:57,704
- Yeah.
- Right?

408
00:25:57,744 --> 00:25:59,541
How well do you and Edie
speak French?

409
00:26:12,785 --> 00:26:15,618
Well, I don't know.
I guess I'm bored with it.

410
00:26:15,655 --> 00:26:18,419
So I'm just going to
quit painting

411
00:26:18,458 --> 00:26:21,586
and we're going to
make movies now.

412
00:26:21,628 --> 00:26:23,960
Make Edie a big star.

413
00:26:29,903 --> 00:26:33,304
Well, I'm not going.

414
00:26:33,339 --> 00:26:35,432
I have nothing to wear.

415
00:26:35,475 --> 00:26:37,136
Why don't you just
try on some clothes?

416
00:26:37,176 --> 00:26:41,237
I don't feel like trying on-
Why do I have to try on clothes?

417
00:26:41,281 --> 00:26:43,408
You have a whole closetful.

418
00:26:43,449 --> 00:26:45,610
Do I look different?

419
00:26:48,721 --> 00:26:51,121
I ran into an old friend
who said every time I saw him

420
00:26:51,157 --> 00:26:53,421
I looked so different
he hardly knew who I was.

421
00:26:53,459 --> 00:26:56,223
Well, do you think
that's true?

422
00:26:56,262 --> 00:26:59,254
Huh?

423
00:26:59,299 --> 00:27:01,733
Edie Sedgwick

424
00:27:01,768 --> 00:27:03,963
in Andy Warhol's
"Poor Little Rich Girl. "

425
00:27:06,205 --> 00:27:07,763
Bravo!

426
00:27:20,053 --> 00:27:22,954
Oh, that's so nice.

427
00:27:33,199 --> 00:27:35,963
I just love that
he doesn't speak any English.

428
00:27:36,002 --> 00:27:39,199
Aru, I want
to touch your cock.

429
00:27:39,238 --> 00:27:41,638
- Oui, Andy. Oui.
- Oui. Isn't he great?

430
00:27:41,674 --> 00:27:45,075
I can't tell what he's saying, but he
keeps talking about Edie.

431
00:27:48,181 --> 00:27:50,706
Just take your pants down.

432
00:27:50,750 --> 00:27:53,344
Andy, critics may love you in France,

433
00:27:53,386 --> 00:27:55,115
but here they say
your work is superficial

434
00:27:55,154 --> 00:27:56,883
and that you wouldn't be
where you are without Edie.

435
00:27:56,923 --> 00:27:58,686
I don't pay attention
to what they write.

436
00:27:58,725 --> 00:28:01,626
I just measure it in inches.

437
00:28:01,661 --> 00:28:04,391
Edie, I understand
you're an artist too.

438
00:28:04,430 --> 00:28:06,421
That was a very long time ago.

439
00:28:06,466 --> 00:28:08,024
Edie's too beautiful
to be an artist.

440
00:28:08,067 --> 00:28:10,729
I think artists should be ugly.

441
00:28:10,770 --> 00:28:12,601
No, Edie's a superstar.

442
00:28:12,638 --> 00:28:13,969
Superstar.

443
00:28:21,314 --> 00:28:22,406
That's crazy.

444
00:28:22,448 --> 00:28:24,040
There's one more thing
on the sidewalk.

445
00:28:24,083 --> 00:28:26,347
Look at that.

446
00:28:26,386 --> 00:28:28,820
Oh, that's what he said.

447
00:28:28,855 --> 00:28:30,413
I got it.

448
00:28:30,456 --> 00:28:34,187
It's like a madhouse in here.
Andy, this is my mother, Alice!

449
00:28:34,227 --> 00:28:36,161
She just flew into town
to help me furnish.

450
00:28:36,195 --> 00:28:39,062
Oh, hi.
You're so beautiful.

451
00:28:39,098 --> 00:28:41,760
It's so nice to meet you.

452
00:28:41,801 --> 00:28:44,702
No no!
Put it over there.

453
00:28:44,737 --> 00:28:47,399
Careful with that box, love.
It's Waterford.

454
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:49,806
Betsy Johnson-
I know, isn't she fabulous?

455
00:28:49,842 --> 00:28:51,639
She asked me
to be her first model.

456
00:28:51,677 --> 00:28:53,804
Anyway, I've got to go.
Ciao.

457
00:28:54,555 --> 00:28:57,183
Oh, Mum-mum
aren't you proud

458
00:28:57,225 --> 00:28:59,853
Pretty soon money will
be falling off trees.

459
00:28:59,894 --> 00:29:03,261
- I won't need any help at all.
- There's a novel idea.

460
00:29:03,297 --> 00:29:06,425
But, Mom, don't you think that Fuzzy
would get a kick out of all of this?

461
00:29:06,467 --> 00:29:09,630
Oh, please. Your father's so square
he doesn't pee in the shower.

462
00:29:09,671 --> 00:29:13,198
Mum-mum!

463
00:29:15,777 --> 00:29:17,506
Hello?

464
00:29:17,545 --> 00:29:21,072
I think your daughter
is going to be super famous.

465
00:29:21,115 --> 00:29:24,881
And what would
be the value in that, Mr. Warhol?

466
00:29:24,919 --> 00:29:28,753
Oh, well, I think everybody
wants to be famous.

467
00:29:30,291 --> 00:29:33,385
Well, I had much
higher hopes for Edith.

468
00:29:33,428 --> 00:29:35,760
Oh.

469
00:29:36,933 --> 00:29:39,493
You know,
I used to dance twice a day.

470
00:29:39,536 --> 00:29:40,935
I'd do this jazz ballet.

471
00:29:40,970 --> 00:29:43,632
And I'd wear leotards
and black tights

472
00:29:43,673 --> 00:29:45,868
and I was too lazy
to take them off.

473
00:29:47,277 --> 00:29:49,745
And I decided
to go with it.

474
00:29:49,779 --> 00:29:51,474
Divine one,

475
00:29:51,514 --> 00:29:55,041
I am entirely superficial
and I intend to stay that way.

476
00:29:55,085 --> 00:29:57,110
But you, my dear,
you are the real thing.

477
00:29:57,153 --> 00:29:59,280
America's next "It" girl.

478
00:29:59,322 --> 00:30:01,950
We'll put you
under contract.

479
00:30:01,991 --> 00:30:05,791
People started to notice
and it sort of caught on.

480
00:30:07,664 --> 00:30:10,030
You know, the earrings,
the thick black eyelashes-

481
00:30:10,066 --> 00:30:11,499
it was all
a part of the show.

482
00:30:24,514 --> 00:30:26,880
This is Andrea Romando
with the BBC.

483
00:30:26,916 --> 00:30:30,682
I'm here with Edie Sedgwick
at the infamous Factory.

484
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:33,280
She is known
as Andy Warhol's superstar.

485
00:30:33,323 --> 00:30:36,815
And in New York, she has been dubbed
Queen of Underground Cinema.

486
00:30:36,860 --> 00:30:40,455
Edie, how does your family feel about
you having this title?

487
00:30:43,166 --> 00:30:44,656
They hate it.

488
00:30:44,701 --> 00:30:47,431
They hated the idea
of my doing any modeling

489
00:30:47,470 --> 00:30:50,303
to make my own way.

490
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:52,706
As soon as I started all of this,
they're sending telegrams

491
00:30:52,742 --> 00:30:56,041
saying, "Oh, you've got to go
model, please. "

492
00:30:56,079 --> 00:30:58,912
At an Andy Warhol art exhibition...

493
00:30:58,948 --> 00:31:00,882
The glamorous Miss Edie
Sedgwick unraveled her long white...

494
00:31:00,917 --> 00:31:04,250
The Plymouth Rock
princess and her commoner companion...

495
00:31:04,287 --> 00:31:06,755
...in town last night,
at Max's Kansas City...

496
00:31:06,790 --> 00:31:09,816
...Hollywood legends...

497
00:31:09,859 --> 00:31:12,020
...the former window
dresser and commercial artist...

498
00:31:12,061 --> 00:31:14,086
...the first girl to bring sex appeal

499
00:31:14,130 --> 00:31:15,427
to American high society.

500
00:31:19,302 --> 00:31:21,395
I'll have a porterhouse,
she'll do the sirloin.

501
00:31:21,437 --> 00:31:24,463
Actually, I think I'll
try the chicken tonight.

502
00:31:24,507 --> 00:31:26,532
Coq au vin, please.

503
00:31:26,576 --> 00:31:29,943
- Miss Sedgwick?
- Why don't you have the grilled fish?

504
00:31:29,979 --> 00:31:32,948
No butter. We don't want you blowing up
now, do we, honey?

505
00:31:32,982 --> 00:31:35,109
You game
for a steak, Warhol?

506
00:31:35,151 --> 00:31:36,550
You sure look like
you could use one.

507
00:31:41,291 --> 00:31:44,226
The Met is thinking
of buying some of Andy's work.

508
00:31:44,260 --> 00:31:46,125
- Oh, lovely.
- How about this?

509
00:31:46,162 --> 00:31:49,563
I've just been commissioned
for a 30-foot bronze stallion

510
00:31:49,599 --> 00:31:51,624
in downtown Santa Barbara.

511
00:31:51,668 --> 00:31:53,533
Oh, Edie does horses too.

512
00:31:53,570 --> 00:31:56,971
Well, where do you think
she learned that?

513
00:31:57,006 --> 00:31:59,566
Has Edie told you
about my studio?

514
00:31:59,609 --> 00:32:01,099
Yeah.

515
00:32:01,144 --> 00:32:03,612
I've seen some
of your work, Warhol.

516
00:32:03,646 --> 00:32:05,477
You're really more
of a printmaker than an artist.

517
00:32:05,515 --> 00:32:07,107
What's your family do?

518
00:32:09,452 --> 00:32:12,114
Well, my father
was in a coal mine.

519
00:32:13,756 --> 00:32:16,623
Andy and I are thinking about making
some more movies together.

520
00:32:16,659 --> 00:32:18,559
If you can call them that.

521
00:32:18,595 --> 00:32:21,655
You can call them whatever you want.

522
00:32:21,698 --> 00:32:25,293
- Like Dorothy, or...
- Ondine.

523
00:32:25,335 --> 00:32:27,326
Hillary.

524
00:32:30,073 --> 00:32:31,734
This whole time
I'm thinking,

525
00:32:31,774 --> 00:32:34,641
"Who is this guy who has my little girl
all turned around?

526
00:32:34,677 --> 00:32:37,771
He must be
some kind of a man. "

527
00:32:38,815 --> 00:32:40,578
Then I talk to you
for two minutes,

528
00:32:40,617 --> 00:32:43,677
and I have to smile, because I don't
have a thing to worry about, do I?

529
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:45,847
You're a full-blown queer.

530
00:32:48,658 --> 00:32:50,421
Andy, we can go now.

531
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:51,984
Edith...

532
00:32:52,028 --> 00:32:54,394
don't you dare
make a scene.

533
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:12,739
Minty had been...

534
00:33:18,888 --> 00:33:21,152
I guess an embarrassment
to the family

535
00:33:21,190 --> 00:33:23,522
because he was different.
He was...

536
00:33:26,029 --> 00:33:28,020
he was a homosexual.

537
00:33:30,633 --> 00:33:32,225
And Fuzzy knew it.

538
00:33:32,268 --> 00:33:36,102
And when Minty came clean,
Fuzzy called him a faggot.

539
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:40,140
You know, he just-

540
00:33:40,176 --> 00:33:41,666
he broke him.

541
00:33:43,947 --> 00:33:47,212
And when they closed the casket lid
on my brother Minty...

542
00:33:49,419 --> 00:33:52,320
I remember Fuzzy
just standing there.

543
00:33:56,225 --> 00:33:59,854
No reaction, just...

544
00:33:59,896 --> 00:34:02,490
standing there...

545
00:34:03,967 --> 00:34:05,832
like a stone.

546
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:09,776
And at his funeral,
no one cried.

547
00:34:11,684 --> 00:34:13,675
No one.

548
00:34:15,935 --> 00:34:17,926
I-

549
00:34:17,970 --> 00:34:20,598
I had to cry
for all of them.

550
00:34:27,512 --> 00:34:30,242
Oh, you made it.
That's great. Oh, hi.

551
00:34:30,281 --> 00:34:32,476
Look who's here,
everybody. Hi.

552
00:34:32,517 --> 00:34:34,348
Hey, Mick, how are you?

553
00:34:34,385 --> 00:34:36,717
Oh, it's great to have you here.
I love the album.

554
00:34:39,090 --> 00:34:41,285
- Jesus, Richie.
- The tissue's hardened, Brig.

555
00:34:41,325 --> 00:34:43,520
You got to really push.

556
00:34:44,896 --> 00:34:47,797
Hey, Brig. What are
you girls up to?

557
00:34:47,832 --> 00:34:49,356
Cocktails, darling.

558
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:51,527
Adderall, Digoxin
and Dextromethamphetamine.

559
00:34:51,569 --> 00:34:54,060
Has certainly more kick
than a martini, no?

560
00:34:54,105 --> 00:34:55,766
You go to med school, Brig?

561
00:34:55,806 --> 00:34:59,139
My parents have had me
doped up on diet pills since I was 10.

562
00:34:59,176 --> 00:35:02,168
Well, my parents plopped me in the bins
before I could drive.

563
00:35:02,213 --> 00:35:04,078
You're an Aquarius,
aren't you?

564
00:35:04,115 --> 00:35:05,548
No, I'm an Aries.

565
00:35:05,583 --> 00:35:08,381
I know an Aquarius
when I see one.

566
00:35:08,419 --> 00:35:10,819
I just adore Aquariuses.

567
00:35:12,757 --> 00:35:14,748
You thirsty for a poke?
It's divine.

568
00:35:16,127 --> 00:35:18,254
Ooh.

569
00:35:38,085 --> 00:35:41,311
Speed was rocket fuel.

570
00:35:41,318 --> 00:35:43,129
It was the only way to keep up

571
00:35:43,130 --> 00:35:47,507
and that was really
the great temptation of the Factory.

572
00:35:47,779 --> 00:35:49,678
It was at perpetual party

573
00:35:49,679 --> 00:35:53,064
in one i was happy
to loose myself in.

574
00:35:56,172 --> 00:35:58,800
Hey, Rich, did you see
my mother's face when she met Andy?

575
00:35:58,842 --> 00:36:00,469
I thought
she was gonna burst.

576
00:36:00,510 --> 00:36:02,273
I know, my mother's
horrified.

577
00:36:02,312 --> 00:36:04,507
Brig keeps threatening to invite
him to Christmas dinner

578
00:36:04,547 --> 00:36:06,447
if she doesn't
up our allowances.

579
00:36:06,483 --> 00:36:08,451
Well, no wonder you never
run out of money.

580
00:36:08,485 --> 00:36:10,919
Edie.

581
00:36:12,188 --> 00:36:15,351
Syd! What are you
doing here?

582
00:36:16,927 --> 00:36:19,259
- I've been sent to find you.
- Oh, that sounds mysterious.

583
00:36:19,296 --> 00:36:21,856
- Who sent you, the Red Chinese?
- No, but...

584
00:36:23,366 --> 00:36:25,766
I am working
for someone pretty big.

585
00:36:25,802 --> 00:36:28,600
- Rockefeller?
- Bigger.

586
00:36:28,638 --> 00:36:31,903
Bigger than Rockefeller
and the Red Chinese?

587
00:36:31,942 --> 00:36:33,534
Well, pray tell, who?

588
00:36:33,576 --> 00:36:37,342
Why don't you come with me
and I'll show you.

589
00:36:41,985 --> 00:36:43,452
Who's that?

590
00:36:43,486 --> 00:36:45,681
- Taxi!
- Oh, darling, I landed straight down

591
00:36:45,722 --> 00:36:47,053
on my
Margaret Jarrold pumps.

592
00:36:47,090 --> 00:36:49,115
Thank God
I didn't break an ankle.

593
00:36:49,847 --> 00:36:52,020
Second Avenue and Fifth, please.

594
00:36:52,156 --> 00:36:54,624
That was just my great escape.
Do you remember that time

595
00:36:54,658 --> 00:36:56,956
when we went to that restaurant-
oh, what was it called?

596
00:36:56,994 --> 00:36:59,087
Durgin Park in Faneuil Hall.

597
00:36:59,129 --> 00:37:01,962
And all the waiters were so crusty,
and- oh!

598
00:37:01,999 --> 00:37:04,467
Watch it.
Watch it! Jesus.

599
00:37:04,501 --> 00:37:06,298
And then I was dancing on the tables,
do you remember?

600
00:37:06,336 --> 00:37:08,167
And I think that they thought
that I stole something,

601
00:37:08,205 --> 00:37:09,968
when really I only
meant to borrow it.

602
00:37:10,007 --> 00:37:11,634
Oh no, it wasn't you!

603
00:37:11,675 --> 00:37:13,142
I don't know what you're talking about.

604
00:37:13,177 --> 00:37:15,338
It was Don-Don.
And Chuckie was there.

605
00:37:15,379 --> 00:37:18,507
- Edie.
- I nearly died laughing.

606
00:37:18,549 --> 00:37:21,109
Edie, I have somebody
that I want you to meet.

607
00:37:21,151 --> 00:37:22,584
This is Edie Sedgwick.

608
00:37:22,619 --> 00:37:24,746
Edie, how about a picture?

609
00:37:24,788 --> 00:37:26,779
Well, hello.

610
00:37:30,460 --> 00:37:33,793
Why don't you put
your arm around her?

611
00:37:33,831 --> 00:37:36,231
Hey, how about one shot?
One shot, Miss Sedgwick?

612
00:37:38,235 --> 00:37:39,896
I got to go to work,
sweetheart.

613
00:37:52,933 --> 00:37:56,425
Well, I wasn't interested
in him because he was famous.

614
00:37:56,470 --> 00:37:59,928
It wasn't as if he was
the first famous person I'd ever met.

615
00:37:59,973 --> 00:38:03,534
But he was so different.

616
00:38:14,730 --> 00:38:17,300
- Its just a bird.
- No, no, no, that`ss...

617
00:38:17,301 --> 00:38:20,126
thats really good.

618
00:38:21,261 --> 00:38:25,760
So, Syd and I caught a couple of your
films last week at the Cinemateque.

619
00:38:26,315 --> 00:38:29,944
You did?
Really? And?

620
00:38:31,258 --> 00:38:34,659
We just- well, we didn't really
understand what they meant.

621
00:38:35,263 --> 00:38:39,639
I don't think that it really
mean anything necessarily.

622
00:38:40,784 --> 00:38:42,718
What about you?

623
00:38:42,853 --> 00:38:46,186
Your songs are pretty-
pretty profound.

624
00:38:46,223 --> 00:38:47,884
What are you trying to say?

625
00:38:49,927 --> 00:38:52,020
I'm not- I'm not trying
to say anything.

626
00:38:53,764 --> 00:38:57,063
I sing about what I see.

627
00:38:59,113 --> 00:39:01,633
He represented
everything that Andy didnt

628
00:39:02,097 --> 00:39:06,369
and I just really
wanted to free myself.

629
00:39:10,933 --> 00:39:12,730
The music was just hypnotic.

630
00:39:12,769 --> 00:39:15,465
- I just think he's so maximal.
- Isn't he?

631
00:39:15,505 --> 00:39:18,201
And he just has that power.
You know people who have that power.

632
00:39:18,241 --> 00:39:20,436
- Like Superman?
- You can't really explain why it is.

633
00:39:20,476 --> 00:39:22,535
It just is.

634
00:39:22,578 --> 00:39:25,479
Well, what do you say to someone
like that? I mean, he's just so famous.

635
00:39:25,515 --> 00:39:27,642
- We didn't really talk, you know.
- Oh, you didn't?

636
00:39:27,684 --> 00:39:29,447
It was just nice to meet him.
Andy, what do you think of this?

637
00:39:29,485 --> 00:39:31,476
Tres chic or tres fou?

638
00:39:31,521 --> 00:39:33,512
Oh, tres chic,
definitely.

639
00:39:33,556 --> 00:39:36,753
Well, I have to watch my spending.
Especially on clothes.

640
00:39:36,793 --> 00:39:38,488
You know, I already
stopped wearing underwear.

641
00:39:38,528 --> 00:39:40,894
Shit, what other sacrifices
do I have to make?

642
00:39:40,930 --> 00:39:43,057
Who do you think you are?

643
00:39:43,099 --> 00:39:45,966
Your family is so rich.

644
00:39:46,002 --> 00:39:48,766
I mean, you're living
on Easy Street.

645
00:39:48,805 --> 00:39:51,740
Oh!

646
00:39:51,774 --> 00:39:53,605
Oh, Mama would love this.

647
00:39:53,643 --> 00:39:55,076
I can buy it for you.

648
00:39:55,111 --> 00:39:57,136
Oh no, you need
to watch your spending.

649
00:39:57,180 --> 00:40:00,411
So, tell me more things.
Who else was he there with?

650
00:40:00,450 --> 00:40:02,577
I don't really remember that,
you know?

651
00:40:02,618 --> 00:40:04,245
But it was just something
about those lyrics.

652
00:40:04,287 --> 00:40:06,812
What he was saying
was really poignant.

653
00:40:06,856 --> 00:40:08,517
Like he really
had something to say.

654
00:40:08,558 --> 00:40:10,219
What?

655
00:40:10,259 --> 00:40:13,092
I was just saying
that he really had something to say.

656
00:40:13,129 --> 00:40:15,063
- How much is this?
- Seven.

657
00:40:15,098 --> 00:40:16,929
- $7?
- $7.

658
00:40:16,966 --> 00:40:18,263
Oh no, that's too much.

659
00:40:20,103 --> 00:40:22,367
Well, I could
give you $4.

660
00:40:26,752 --> 00:40:29,346
James, dear, what are you
doing here so early?

661
00:40:29,388 --> 00:40:31,322
- I...
- Sit down.

662
00:40:31,357 --> 00:40:34,758
We had an appointment at my office
at noon, Miss Sedgwick. It's 2:30.

663
00:40:34,794 --> 00:40:37,695
You've known me since
I was three, James. Call me Edie.

664
00:40:37,730 --> 00:40:40,824
Your...

665
00:40:40,867 --> 00:40:42,767
spending, Miss Sedgwick.

666
00:40:42,802 --> 00:40:44,770
You're going to be
bankrupt soon.

667
00:40:44,804 --> 00:40:47,170
James, you take life
too seriously.

668
00:40:47,206 --> 00:40:49,106
How could I possibly
be bankrupt?

669
00:40:49,142 --> 00:40:51,007
My grandfather
invented the elevator.

670
00:40:51,043 --> 00:40:54,376
Then you should be familiar
with the concept of up and down.

671
00:40:54,413 --> 00:40:57,814
When you got here,
your trust fund-

672
00:40:57,850 --> 00:40:59,147
thank you.

673
00:40:59,185 --> 00:41:01,949
Your trust fund was up.

674
00:41:03,689 --> 00:41:07,125
After a year and a half,
it's almost in the basement.

675
00:41:09,328 --> 00:41:12,786
- Oh shit.
- What, what, what?

676
00:41:12,832 --> 00:41:15,027
Well, what about all
the money that I'm making?

677
00:41:15,067 --> 00:41:17,194
Well,
you keep spending it.

678
00:41:19,238 --> 00:41:21,103
Your father
is very upset with you

679
00:41:21,140 --> 00:41:23,506
cavorting with drug addicts

680
00:41:23,543 --> 00:41:25,340
and fringe elements.

681
00:41:25,378 --> 00:41:28,404
You tell Fuzzy for me that those are
some very talented people.

682
00:41:28,447 --> 00:41:30,711
If you don't
change your friends,

683
00:41:30,750 --> 00:41:32,945
you'll get nothing from him.

684
00:41:35,221 --> 00:41:36,848
Rich, will you make sure
the oven's off?

685
00:41:36,889 --> 00:41:38,880
I'm sorry, I have to go.

686
00:42:01,380 --> 00:42:04,247
Oh, looks like Cupid's
been busy as a bull dyke.

687
00:42:04,283 --> 00:42:06,274
You look beautiful, honey.

688
00:42:08,588 --> 00:42:10,954
Hello.

689
00:42:10,990 --> 00:42:12,651
What are you doing?

690
00:42:12,692 --> 00:42:14,683
Thought you weren't
gonna paint any more.

691
00:42:16,429 --> 00:42:18,397
Oh, look, it's Judy Garland.

692
00:42:18,431 --> 00:42:21,229
Wouldn't it be funny if it turned out
she was really a man?

693
00:42:21,267 --> 00:42:22,825
Wouldn't it be funny if it turned out

694
00:42:22,868 --> 00:42:24,358
Gerard was really a man?

695
00:42:24,403 --> 00:42:25,870
When you get through sucking on that,

696
00:42:25,905 --> 00:42:27,566
come over
and see for yourself.

697
00:42:27,607 --> 00:42:31,099
Only if I can record the slurps.

698
00:42:31,143 --> 00:42:35,045
Oh, Andy, Sam called. He's sending
a limo for us for the show tonight.

699
00:42:35,081 --> 00:42:36,548
I hear rock stars like limos.

700
00:42:39,518 --> 00:42:42,578
I think it's just delicious
that Edie has a boyfriend.

701
00:42:42,622 --> 00:42:44,817
I'm not looking
for anything like that.

702
00:42:44,857 --> 00:42:46,848
Okay.

703
00:42:52,598 --> 00:42:55,362
Don't be jealous, Andy.
He's nothing like you.

704
00:42:55,401 --> 00:42:59,098
Oh no, I'm not. I've just never made it
with a rock star before.

705
00:42:59,138 --> 00:43:00,867
- It must be neat.
- I'm not making it-

706
00:43:00,906 --> 00:43:03,841
Why do you do that?
Why do you have to make me feel guilty?

707
00:43:03,876 --> 00:43:06,344
I hate it when people
make me feel bad.

708
00:43:06,379 --> 00:43:08,847
Well, you lied to me.
You said you didn't talk to him.

709
00:43:08,881 --> 00:43:10,974
- And then that picture in the paper...
- Andy, this is absurd.

710
00:43:11,017 --> 00:43:12,746
It was a photograph.

711
00:43:12,785 --> 00:43:15,345
You know, we barely met.
You meet people all the time.

712
00:43:15,388 --> 00:43:17,117
Do you fuck them?

713
00:43:17,156 --> 00:43:20,819
Well, I just think sex
is too abstract anyway.

714
00:43:33,708 --> 00:43:35,403
Andy, what do you think
about the war in Vietnam?

715
00:43:35,443 --> 00:43:37,570
I don't know. Ask Edie.
What do you think, Edie?

716
00:43:37,612 --> 00:43:40,137
Well, we prefer
"I Dream of Jeannie. "

717
00:43:40,181 --> 00:43:41,648
Andy, in the story of your life,

718
00:43:41,682 --> 00:43:43,343
who would you want
to play Andy Warhol?

719
00:43:43,384 --> 00:43:45,875
Oh, Edie. She's so perfect.
She does everything better than me.

720
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:48,480
- Hi.
- Hello.

721
00:43:48,522 --> 00:43:50,786
Andy, I need
to talk to you.

722
00:43:50,825 --> 00:43:52,656
I've gotten myself
into a little pickle

723
00:43:52,693 --> 00:43:55,491
and I was just wondering if you could
maybe pay me for some of my work?

724
00:43:55,529 --> 00:43:57,258
Edie, you know the movies
haven't made any money yet.

725
00:43:57,298 --> 00:43:58,765
So you just need
to be patient.

726
00:43:58,799 --> 00:44:01,063
Well, I can't be patient.
I have nothing to live on.

727
00:44:01,102 --> 00:44:02,729
- Andy, you and I both know...
- Sam.

728
00:44:02,770 --> 00:44:04,761
...that you are
never giving up painting.

729
00:44:04,805 --> 00:44:07,035
You've just been saying that
to get publicity.

730
00:44:07,074 --> 00:44:09,065
- Well, guess what?
- What?

731
00:44:09,110 --> 00:44:11,169
- It worked.
- Great.

732
00:44:11,212 --> 00:44:13,737
Come on, everyone
wants to meet you.

733
00:44:13,781 --> 00:44:15,772
This way.

734
00:44:26,994 --> 00:44:29,724
Hello, kitty-kat.

735
00:44:29,764 --> 00:44:33,200
Hello.

736
00:44:33,234 --> 00:44:35,566
That's a wonderful scarf.

737
00:44:35,603 --> 00:44:37,935
Thank you.
Left my tux in the shop.

738
00:44:39,540 --> 00:44:41,235
You here to buy a painting?

739
00:44:42,777 --> 00:44:46,269
Tell me, why are all these cats gonna
pay a fortune for a soup can?

740
00:44:46,313 --> 00:44:47,712
I mean...

741
00:44:47,748 --> 00:44:50,216
You just have to look
beyond the obvious.

742
00:44:50,251 --> 00:44:52,583
Am I stupid, or...

743
00:44:52,620 --> 00:44:54,588
I don't get it.
Am I stupid?

744
00:44:54,622 --> 00:44:57,648
You're being a little stupid.
I mean, don't you think it's intriguing?

745
00:44:57,692 --> 00:44:59,250
Not just a little bit?

746
00:44:59,293 --> 00:45:02,194
You know, it may
just be a painting,

747
00:45:02,229 --> 00:45:04,629
but it's an idea.

748
00:45:04,665 --> 00:45:07,828
And the man behind that idea
is what's interesting.

749
00:45:09,303 --> 00:45:13,364
I think the man has got his priorities
all out of whack.

750
00:45:14,709 --> 00:45:17,177
Whole world's burning up
and this cat's making...

751
00:45:17,211 --> 00:45:19,372
gods out of garbage.

752
00:45:19,413 --> 00:45:20,903
Well, the whole world
may be burning up,

753
00:45:20,948 --> 00:45:23,644
but that doesn't mean
that we have to be cynical.

754
00:45:24,933 --> 00:45:27,299
Got the whole world on
a string, don't you?

755
00:45:29,204 --> 00:45:32,537
But inside there...

756
00:45:32,574 --> 00:45:35,634
well, it's as empty
as your friend's soup can.

757
00:45:43,318 --> 00:45:46,219
I'll see you around...

758
00:45:47,555 --> 00:45:49,546
superstar.

759
00:45:59,801 --> 00:46:02,531
Well, you're just so smart, Chuck.

760
00:46:02,570 --> 00:46:04,265
I just think you should
start directing.

761
00:46:04,305 --> 00:46:06,205
I mean, you do
the camera so good.

762
00:46:06,241 --> 00:46:09,142
We always need people
like you just to make things happen.

763
00:46:09,177 --> 00:46:12,044
Well, I mean, I'm really
just here for Edie, you know?

764
00:46:12,080 --> 00:46:14,844
Oh. Well, it's just such a pity

765
00:46:14,883 --> 00:46:17,249
that she should get all the attention
when you're the one who found her.

766
00:46:20,655 --> 00:46:22,179
I hope she still wants
to do more movies.

767
00:46:22,223 --> 00:46:23,485
She does.

768
00:46:23,525 --> 00:46:25,083
We- we do,
we love movies.

769
00:46:25,126 --> 00:46:26,684
I mean, in fact,
I had this-

770
00:46:26,728 --> 00:46:29,253
I just don't know
if she's being...

771
00:46:29,297 --> 00:46:31,561
well, I mean, you know her
better than me.

772
00:46:31,599 --> 00:46:33,829
But, it seems like when
the camera's on sometimes

773
00:46:33,868 --> 00:46:35,301
she just doesn't seem...

774
00:46:37,005 --> 00:46:40,406
I don't know, I just wouldn't
want it to be disappointing.

775
00:46:40,442 --> 00:46:41,602
It won't.

776
00:46:41,643 --> 00:46:44,203
I can have her say
anything you want.

777
00:46:44,245 --> 00:46:46,873
She trusts me more
than anyone.

778
00:46:46,915 --> 00:46:48,610
Oh.

779
00:46:58,751 --> 00:47:02,517
"Beauty Number Two,"
an Andy Warhol production.

780
00:47:02,555 --> 00:47:05,888
Daddy, will you
pass me my martini?

781
00:47:06,892 --> 00:47:09,486
- Edie?
- Yes, Chuckles?

782
00:47:10,796 --> 00:47:13,094
Chuckles- didn't I
give you that name?

783
00:47:13,132 --> 00:47:15,896
Edie, do you
like horses?

784
00:47:15,935 --> 00:47:18,335
Horses have whiskers.

785
00:47:18,370 --> 00:47:21,305
Yes, horses.
Do you ride?

786
00:47:21,340 --> 00:47:24,832
Since I was a little girl,
I've just adored them.

787
00:47:24,877 --> 00:47:27,345
Daddy taught me to ride
before I could walk.

788
00:47:27,379 --> 00:47:28,471
My first horse...

789
00:47:28,514 --> 00:47:30,948
Your father was
a handsome man?

790
00:47:30,983 --> 00:47:33,577
Oh, Fuzzy?

791
00:47:33,619 --> 00:47:35,644
He still is.

792
00:47:35,688 --> 00:47:38,885
How about your brothers? They were
quite attractive, too, weren't they?

793
00:47:38,924 --> 00:47:41,722
They must have had
a lot of women then.

794
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:44,320
Wha-?

795
00:47:44,363 --> 00:47:46,888
Did they find
you attractive?

796
00:47:46,932 --> 00:47:50,026
Of course.
I was their family.

797
00:47:50,069 --> 00:47:52,936
Did you find them
attractive?

798
00:47:56,475 --> 00:47:59,273
- Do you...
- Can you change the question?

799
00:47:59,311 --> 00:48:03,111
find Gino attractive? That's- that's
what I was going to ask you, Edie.

800
00:48:03,148 --> 00:48:05,878
Gino?

801
00:48:05,918 --> 00:48:08,716
He's devastatingly handsome,
isn't he?

802
00:48:08,754 --> 00:48:10,312
Kiss him.

803
00:48:15,661 --> 00:48:17,754
Are you scared?

804
00:48:28,507 --> 00:48:30,031
Come on, Edie.
Like you mean it.

805
00:48:40,519 --> 00:48:43,545
Gino, she likes when
you get rough.

806
00:48:43,589 --> 00:48:46,319
She likes those tough men.

807
00:48:46,358 --> 00:48:49,156
Strong men are what turn you on,
isn't that right, babycakes?

808
00:48:49,194 --> 00:48:50,422
No.

809
00:48:50,462 --> 00:48:53,295
Not like
your brother, Minty.

810
00:48:53,332 --> 00:48:56,028
Your father wasn't
so keen on him, was he?

811
00:48:57,236 --> 00:48:59,431
Who was he keen on? You?

812
00:49:01,407 --> 00:49:03,807
Okay, get off!
Enough!

813
00:49:14,787 --> 00:49:16,584
Andy, are we finished?

814
00:49:16,622 --> 00:49:19,113
No, Edie,
we're still rolling.

815
00:49:27,906 --> 00:49:30,306
Sedgwick.

816
00:49:36,915 --> 00:49:38,678
Edie Sedgwick!

817
00:49:39,851 --> 00:49:41,785
Hello.

818
00:50:38,816 --> 00:50:40,943
How'd a nice chick
like you get mixed up

819
00:50:40,985 --> 00:50:42,816
in the whole
acting racket?

820
00:50:42,853 --> 00:50:45,481
It was
"Breakfast At Tiffany's. "

821
00:50:46,957 --> 00:50:50,017
You know that poster with Audrey
and her hair's pulled back

822
00:50:50,061 --> 00:50:52,791
and she's smoking through
the black cigarette holder?

823
00:50:54,598 --> 00:50:56,122
You want to live
in a movie?

824
00:50:56,167 --> 00:50:58,499
I never saw
the movie.

825
00:50:58,536 --> 00:51:00,834
So then you haven't
read the book, huh?

826
00:51:00,871 --> 00:51:03,499
Well, Audrey
isn't in the book.

827
00:51:04,809 --> 00:51:07,107
Book's a bit different.

828
00:51:08,946 --> 00:51:11,608
Book's about a working girl

829
00:51:11,649 --> 00:51:13,344
and a writer.

830
00:51:13,384 --> 00:51:15,784
An artist.

831
00:51:15,820 --> 00:51:19,916
You see, the artist steals
the girl's stories,

832
00:51:19,957 --> 00:51:22,858
makes a fortune,

833
00:51:22,893 --> 00:51:25,259
and the girl doesn't
get anything.

834
00:51:27,598 --> 00:51:31,329
Why do you have
such a problem with Andy?

835
00:51:31,368 --> 00:51:33,302
Because of what
he worships.

836
00:51:33,337 --> 00:51:36,829
And what about you? I mean,
I saw your face in those flashbulbs.

837
00:51:36,874 --> 00:51:39,707
You pretend to be
some sort of crusader,

838
00:51:39,744 --> 00:51:41,678
but I saw you
basking in it.

839
00:51:41,712 --> 00:51:44,044
Oh, don't get us confused,
sister, all right?

840
00:51:44,081 --> 00:51:46,015
Those bulbs, they get
a message out.

841
00:51:46,050 --> 00:51:48,848
What- what exactly
is the message...

842
00:51:48,886 --> 00:51:51,184
aside from
"Look at me"?

843
00:51:53,023 --> 00:51:55,253
Nah, I'm just
a guitar player.

844
00:51:55,292 --> 00:51:56,691
- That's all.
- No no.

845
00:51:56,727 --> 00:52:00,185
You're an overpaid prophet
and I'm a poor little rich girl.

846
00:52:01,932 --> 00:52:04,400
Lady, you don't know
shit about shit.

847
00:52:04,435 --> 00:52:07,461
Open your eyes, you know? Take a look
at the world around you, okay?

848
00:52:07,505 --> 00:52:09,905
- It's very easy for you to say that...
- It's not all Park Avenue.

849
00:52:09,940 --> 00:52:11,874
- You do know that, don't you?
- ... from your wonderful,

850
00:52:11,909 --> 00:52:14,139
very glorified position
where you have your cars

851
00:52:14,178 --> 00:52:15,873
and your houses
and your fucking bike.

852
00:52:15,913 --> 00:52:17,471
You think I give a shit
about any of this?

853
00:52:17,515 --> 00:52:19,608
- I think it's obvious you do.
- You think I actually care?

854
00:52:19,650 --> 00:52:21,777
It's not real, babe.

855
00:52:44,608 --> 00:52:46,633
- Big house, huh?
- Big house.

856
00:52:46,677 --> 00:52:48,770
- Big family, too?
- Big family.

857
00:52:48,813 --> 00:52:50,804
Tell me about
your house.

858
00:52:50,848 --> 00:52:52,406
Mmm.

859
00:52:55,052 --> 00:52:57,748
We lived on a ranch.
We lived on two ranches

860
00:52:57,788 --> 00:52:59,255
in California.

861
00:52:59,290 --> 00:53:01,224
- Two ranches?
- Two ranches with-

862
00:53:01,258 --> 00:53:02,657
Must have been
a big family.

863
00:53:02,693 --> 00:53:04,354
It was a big family.
We had horses

864
00:53:04,395 --> 00:53:06,363
and cattle and we had-

865
00:53:06,397 --> 00:53:08,388
Lots of brothers
and sisters?

866
00:53:08,432 --> 00:53:11,424
We had eight brothers
and sisters.

867
00:53:11,468 --> 00:53:14,665
Now I have six
brothers and sisters.

868
00:53:16,907 --> 00:53:19,273
Well, what happened
to the other two?

869
00:53:21,378 --> 00:53:24,074
Minty...

870
00:53:25,950 --> 00:53:28,043
hanged himself

871
00:53:28,085 --> 00:53:30,053
at a place
called Silver Hill,

872
00:53:30,087 --> 00:53:32,146
which was sort of...

873
00:53:32,189 --> 00:53:34,350
a rehabilitation center.

874
00:53:34,391 --> 00:53:37,827
And Bobby...

875
00:53:37,862 --> 00:53:40,763
- Jesus.
- ... who was my elder brother

876
00:53:40,798 --> 00:53:43,767
ran his bike into a bus
on Fifth Avenue.

877
00:53:46,570 --> 00:53:49,698
But the funny thing
was was that I was in a-

878
00:53:49,740 --> 00:53:53,471
a car accident on the same-
it was New Year's Eve,

879
00:53:53,510 --> 00:53:57,344
and I- well, he died,

880
00:53:57,381 --> 00:54:00,782
and- and I didn't die.

881
00:54:00,818 --> 00:54:02,843
Babe.

882
00:55:52,062 --> 00:55:53,825
I was out with a couple
of heavies tonight.

883
00:55:53,864 --> 00:55:55,354
We talked about you
all evening.

884
00:55:55,399 --> 00:55:56,832
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah, guess who?

885
00:55:56,867 --> 00:55:59,062
- Diana Vreeland?
- No.

886
00:55:59,103 --> 00:56:00,798
- John Lennon?
- No.

887
00:56:00,838 --> 00:56:02,396
Edie Sedgwick?

888
00:56:03,574 --> 00:56:05,542
No, I haven't seen her.

889
00:56:05,576 --> 00:56:07,510
Don't know where
she is.

890
00:56:07,544 --> 00:56:09,944
Hey, you wanna hear
my new idea for a movie?

891
00:56:12,216 --> 00:56:13,945
Think I can invite her
for dinner?

892
00:56:13,984 --> 00:56:16,714
- Who?
- Edie.

893
00:56:16,754 --> 00:56:18,551
You wanna introduce her
to your mother?

894
00:56:18,589 --> 00:56:21,057
Why?

895
00:56:21,091 --> 00:56:23,184
Well, I hadn't thought-
I don't know.

896
00:56:23,227 --> 00:56:24,717
Might be nice.

897
00:56:24,762 --> 00:56:27,458
Jeez, Andy, you must really miss her.

898
00:56:27,498 --> 00:56:29,796
You never invite
anybody else over.

899
00:56:29,833 --> 00:56:32,233
Oh, cut it out.
You can't be that mean.

900
00:56:32,269 --> 00:56:34,464
Well, you never
invited me over.

901
00:56:34,505 --> 00:56:36,939
You need to lose
25 Ibs first.

902
00:56:36,974 --> 00:56:39,465
My mother's not gonna feed you.
She's nastier than you are.

903
00:56:39,510 --> 00:56:41,774
She is not!

904
00:56:51,522 --> 00:56:53,285
I draw too, like Andy.

905
00:56:53,323 --> 00:56:54,881
Oh, you do?

906
00:56:54,925 --> 00:56:58,224
My husband work in
coal mine back then, yeah?

907
00:56:58,262 --> 00:57:00,594
And he very very
good-looking.

908
00:57:00,631 --> 00:57:02,496
Beautiful white hair.

909
00:57:02,533 --> 00:57:05,696
Every girl want this boy,
but he want me.

910
00:57:05,736 --> 00:57:08,227
- But I no want.
- Well, why didn't you want him?

911
00:57:08,272 --> 00:57:09,603
- I 15.
- Oh.

912
00:57:09,640 --> 00:57:12,905
But then one day,
he bring chocolate...

913
00:57:14,945 --> 00:57:17,345
...for purposes to
marry him.

914
00:57:17,381 --> 00:57:20,976
So for this candy,
I marry him.

915
00:57:23,053 --> 00:57:24,315
Oh!

916
00:57:24,354 --> 00:57:27,881
You make my Andy
so very happy.

917
00:57:27,925 --> 00:57:29,119
Oh.

918
00:57:29,159 --> 00:57:31,354
Oh, my special boy.

919
00:57:32,529 --> 00:57:34,827
With you, I think,

920
00:57:34,865 --> 00:57:37,493
all his skin blotches
go away.

921
00:57:37,534 --> 00:57:39,297
Mama, dost.

922
00:57:39,336 --> 00:57:40,860
Let me help you
with that.

923
00:57:40,904 --> 00:57:43,168
You the boss,
applesauce.

924
00:57:44,975 --> 00:57:47,500
You know, Andy, I've been spending
a lot of time with Billy.

925
00:57:47,544 --> 00:57:49,409
And I think that the more
I think about it,

926
00:57:49,446 --> 00:57:50,777
I really think that
you should meet.

927
00:57:50,814 --> 00:57:52,338
You'd really like
each other.

928
00:57:52,382 --> 00:57:53,713
Why would he want
to meet me?

929
00:57:53,750 --> 00:57:55,775
Well, because
you're a genius.

930
00:57:55,819 --> 00:57:58,014
And he's a genius.
Well, isn't he a genius, Julia?

931
00:57:58,055 --> 00:57:59,647
Oh, my boy a genius.

932
00:57:59,690 --> 00:58:01,920
Can you imagine how-
I mean, if we made a movie or something,

933
00:58:01,959 --> 00:58:04,018
wouldn't that be fun,
how explosive that would be?

934
00:58:04,061 --> 00:58:05,790
I just think if we
took him to The Factory

935
00:58:05,829 --> 00:58:08,229
everybody would respond very well.
Plus, he'd look beautiful-

936
00:58:08,265 --> 00:58:10,699
Edie, I just wanted to
get that for you.

937
00:58:10,734 --> 00:58:12,929
I know it's only $50,

938
00:58:12,970 --> 00:58:15,370
but, well, I just
like the word "genius. "

939
00:58:15,405 --> 00:58:17,339
I just think you should
say it over and over.

940
00:58:17,374 --> 00:58:19,706
Genius, genius,
genius, genius...

941
00:58:19,743 --> 00:58:22,041
Yeah, I dream
of genius.

942
00:58:24,281 --> 00:58:26,715
- Genius?
- Mmm-hmm.

943
00:58:26,750 --> 00:58:30,686
He used that word?
That sounds like your word.

944
00:58:30,721 --> 00:58:34,521
Well, genius,
brilliant, superstar-

945
00:58:34,558 --> 00:58:36,458
they're just words.

946
00:58:36,493 --> 00:58:39,360
What's important
is the sentiment.

947
00:58:39,396 --> 00:58:42,126
What's important
is the word.

948
00:58:43,133 --> 00:58:45,101
Well...

949
00:58:45,135 --> 00:58:48,935
you say you want to make a movie
with me, let's make a movie.

950
00:58:50,774 --> 00:58:52,366
Why?

951
00:58:52,409 --> 00:58:55,708
You want to make a movie
with me, I need to know why.

952
00:58:55,746 --> 00:58:58,909
Oh, babycakes.

953
00:58:58,949 --> 00:59:00,974
You're gonna hurt that
enormous brain of yours

954
00:59:01,018 --> 00:59:03,179
with all that thinking
you do.

955
00:59:12,930 --> 00:59:14,227
Ow.

956
00:59:20,904 --> 00:59:24,237
Oh, Andy,
don't be nervous.

957
00:59:33,550 --> 00:59:35,711
Oh he's here.
Chuck, get the camera ready. He's here.

958
00:59:35,752 --> 00:59:37,913
- Oh, hello.
- There she is, baby.

959
00:59:47,097 --> 00:59:49,065
You know Andy.

960
00:59:49,099 --> 00:59:51,158
- Hey.
- Say hello. This is Andy.

961
00:59:51,201 --> 00:59:54,500
Hi. Oh, wow,
you're such a beauty.

962
00:59:54,538 --> 00:59:57,132
Oh, here, would you
sign my book?

963
00:59:58,442 --> 01:00:00,637
Yeah, man.

964
01:00:04,815 --> 01:00:07,875
Oh, great.
Thank you.

965
01:00:07,918 --> 01:00:10,978
This is everybody.
This is The Factory.

966
01:00:11,021 --> 01:00:12,921
Should we start?
What do you think?

967
01:00:12,956 --> 01:00:14,583
Yeah, let's-

968
01:00:14,625 --> 01:00:17,458
I think we should
discuss salary

969
01:00:17,494 --> 01:00:19,894
in the beginning so there's
no misunderstanding.

970
01:00:19,930 --> 01:00:22,160
Oh, he never pays
the actors.

971
01:00:22,199 --> 01:00:24,133
You expect him
to work for free?

972
01:00:24,167 --> 01:00:27,603
Uh... um...

973
01:00:30,173 --> 01:00:33,165
- I could give him $11.
- $11?

974
01:00:33,210 --> 01:00:35,269
He's got $11.

975
01:00:35,312 --> 01:00:36,336
$11.

976
01:00:36,380 --> 01:00:38,905
Maybe we just take
11 of these instead.

977
01:00:38,949 --> 01:00:41,850
No, man.
Don't sweat it.

978
01:00:41,885 --> 01:00:45,514
I think my grandma's got 11 of these
stacked in her basement.

979
01:00:45,555 --> 01:00:47,887
You know?

980
01:00:47,924 --> 01:00:51,052
So...

981
01:00:51,094 --> 01:00:53,562
oh, you want
to make a movie?

982
01:00:53,597 --> 01:00:56,691
- Oh, yeah.
- Where do we start, Andy?

983
01:00:56,733 --> 01:00:58,792
Yeah, do you want to
just sit down here

984
01:00:58,835 --> 01:01:01,065
in front
of the camera?

985
01:01:06,576 --> 01:01:10,103
You know what, man?
Nah, I don't wanna sit.

986
01:01:10,147 --> 01:01:12,377
Can I just stand
in front of the chair?

987
01:01:12,416 --> 01:01:15,283
Oh, yeah. I mean, you know,
you can do whatever.

988
01:01:15,319 --> 01:01:16,980
It's your screen test.

989
01:01:19,289 --> 01:01:21,280
No, it's not.
It's yours.

990
01:01:23,660 --> 01:01:26,788
Come on, man,
direct me.

991
01:01:31,201 --> 01:01:33,533
Well, sit down.

992
01:01:47,984 --> 01:01:49,542
I'm sorry.

993
01:01:51,455 --> 01:01:54,686
You could just look
at the camera maybe.

994
01:01:55,759 --> 01:01:58,023
Yeah, I could do it.

995
01:01:58,061 --> 01:02:00,791
So this is
where you work?

996
01:02:00,831 --> 01:02:04,790
This is where you paint
your cans of beans

997
01:02:04,835 --> 01:02:07,497
- or whatever?
- Yeah.

998
01:02:07,537 --> 01:02:09,937
It's a big space, man.

999
01:02:09,973 --> 01:02:12,032
- Thanks.
- Right in the city.

1000
01:02:12,075 --> 01:02:15,533
Must be real expensive.

1001
01:02:17,381 --> 01:02:19,440
Oh, no.

1002
01:02:19,483 --> 01:02:21,974
- No, it's not.
- Guy like you...

1003
01:02:23,553 --> 01:02:26,181
must be really
generous, huh?

1004
01:02:26,223 --> 01:02:28,521
- I mean...
- No.

1005
01:02:28,558 --> 01:02:31,652
taking care
of all these people.

1006
01:02:39,503 --> 01:02:42,939
Do you smoke, man,
or you just do that faggy speed shit?

1007
01:02:42,973 --> 01:02:44,668
Just the "faggy
speed shit. "

1008
01:02:46,777 --> 01:02:49,678
Come on, man.

1009
01:03:00,590 --> 01:03:03,889
No, man. Keep it. That's for you.

1010
01:03:06,730 --> 01:03:08,755
- Here.
- Yeah.

1011
01:03:12,702 --> 01:03:15,330
I think we got it.

1012
01:03:15,372 --> 01:03:18,239
Well, great.

1013
01:03:18,275 --> 01:03:20,470
Yeah, that was
so interesting. Thanks.

1014
01:03:20,510 --> 01:03:22,910
- Don't you think, Chuck?
- Yeah.

1015
01:03:22,946 --> 01:03:25,710
- Got everything you want?
- Oh, yeah. It was neat.

1016
01:03:25,749 --> 01:03:27,512
- All right.
- Thanks.

1017
01:03:27,551 --> 01:03:29,542
Let's split.

1018
01:03:37,431 --> 01:03:39,558
What the hell was that?

1019
01:03:39,600 --> 01:03:42,899
- You understand that he's my friend.
- He's your friend?

1020
01:03:42,937 --> 01:03:45,303
He's my friend.

1021
01:03:45,339 --> 01:03:47,967
Baby, your friend
is a bloodsucker, you know that?

1022
01:03:48,009 --> 01:03:50,000
You're his prop.

1023
01:03:50,044 --> 01:03:52,478
Okay?
You're disposable to him.

1024
01:03:52,513 --> 01:03:55,141
Man, you should
fucking hate him.

1025
01:03:55,183 --> 01:03:58,152
- He'll fucking kill you.
- I can't hate him!

1026
01:03:59,654 --> 01:04:01,588
Come on, man.
Let me out.

1027
01:04:01,622 --> 01:04:03,613
I'm not kidding, man.
Let me out.

1028
01:04:05,927 --> 01:04:08,122
Edie, come on.
Come with me.

1029
01:04:10,231 --> 01:04:13,564
You're so scared,
baby.

1030
01:04:13,601 --> 01:04:16,297
You're so scared
of losing everything

1031
01:04:16,337 --> 01:04:20,103
that doesn't
mean anything.

1032
01:04:34,388 --> 01:04:36,481
Take care
of yourself, babe.

1033
01:04:43,297 --> 01:04:45,629
It was the biggest mistake of my life.

1034
01:04:51,038 --> 01:04:54,496
He was the first
and the last person

1035
01:04:54,542 --> 01:04:56,601
that I ever loved
like that.

1036
01:04:58,713 --> 01:05:00,977
And I know everyone says
that about their first,

1037
01:05:01,015 --> 01:05:04,280
but when he and I
were together

1038
01:05:04,318 --> 01:05:07,287
it felt perfect.

1039
01:05:31,846 --> 01:05:33,905
Are you filming
right now?

1040
01:05:33,948 --> 01:05:35,973
Oh.

1041
01:05:36,017 --> 01:05:38,781
So this is the movies.

1042
01:05:38,819 --> 01:05:41,344
- Andy. Andy, I saw the craziest thing.
- Shh!

1043
01:05:41,389 --> 01:05:44,722
I always thought they'd be bigger.
Do you want me to talk?

1044
01:05:44,759 --> 01:05:47,387
Ingrid, tell us another one
of your hilarious stories.

1045
01:05:47,428 --> 01:05:48,918
You're going to be such a big star.

1046
01:05:48,963 --> 01:05:51,158
Ingrid Superstar!

1047
01:05:51,198 --> 01:05:53,257
You know, I've never done
nothing like this before.

1048
01:05:53,301 --> 01:05:54,495
Just be like Edie.

1049
01:05:54,535 --> 01:05:56,526
Except the part where
she takes too many drugs.

1050
01:05:56,570 --> 01:05:58,800
Is there another part?

1051
01:05:58,839 --> 01:06:00,807
Oh no, I don't do
the heavy stuff.

1052
01:06:00,841 --> 01:06:02,968
I think Edie and Ingrid
look like sisters.

1053
01:06:03,010 --> 01:06:04,978
Andy, she doesn't
look anything like me.

1054
01:06:05,012 --> 01:06:07,480
"Andy, she doesn't
look anything like me. "

1055
01:06:07,515 --> 01:06:09,380
The resemblance
is uncanny.

1056
01:06:09,417 --> 01:06:12,511
Tell me about the first
time a boy touched you.

1057
01:06:12,553 --> 01:06:14,020
Oh yeah, Charlie Connell

1058
01:06:14,055 --> 01:06:15,955
paid me a nickel to put
his hand up my dress.

1059
01:06:15,990 --> 01:06:19,016
After that, it was so easy I charged
all his friends a dime.

1060
01:06:19,060 --> 01:06:22,154
Seriously,
by the time I was 15,

1061
01:06:22,196 --> 01:06:23,891
between me and my friend,
we had 68 bucks,

1062
01:06:23,931 --> 01:06:25,796
which was enough for a bus ticket

1063
01:06:25,833 --> 01:06:27,824
and cab fare and a hot meal
at Cafe Figaro,

1064
01:06:27,868 --> 01:06:29,995
where you guys
picked me up.

1065
01:06:30,037 --> 01:06:33,370
Miss Sedgwick, open up!

1066
01:06:34,508 --> 01:06:36,499
Miss Sedgwick!

1067
01:06:41,782 --> 01:06:43,977
Merry Christmas,
Mrs. Whitley.

1068
01:06:44,018 --> 01:06:46,418
Christmas was last week,
Miss Sedgwick.

1069
01:06:46,454 --> 01:06:48,445
So was December.

1070
01:06:48,489 --> 01:06:50,821
November was the month
before that.

1071
01:06:50,858 --> 01:06:53,884
And we all know
when October was.

1072
01:06:55,229 --> 01:06:58,960
Happy New Year.
Your rent's three months late.

1073
01:07:07,541 --> 01:07:09,532
Taxi!

1074
01:07:13,214 --> 01:07:16,741
I need money, James.
I need it now.

1075
01:07:16,784 --> 01:07:18,877
It's all spent,
Miss Sedgwick.

1076
01:07:18,919 --> 01:07:20,887
I need to pay
for my apartment.

1077
01:07:20,921 --> 01:07:23,412
Your father pays half your
rent every month, period.

1078
01:07:23,457 --> 01:07:25,152
He calls it tough love.

1079
01:07:25,192 --> 01:07:28,218
In my opinion, young lady,
he's been quite generous.

1080
01:07:28,262 --> 01:07:31,595
You want to know what "tough love"
was for me, James?

1081
01:07:33,134 --> 01:07:36,695
Trying to keep
my father

1082
01:07:36,737 --> 01:07:39,638
out of my bed since
I was eight years old.

1083
01:07:39,673 --> 01:07:43,165
My God.

1084
01:07:43,210 --> 01:07:45,303
Does your
mother know?

1085
01:07:45,346 --> 01:07:47,541
- Did you ever tell her?
- Yeah.

1086
01:07:47,581 --> 01:07:50,607
What did she say?

1087
01:07:50,651 --> 01:07:52,642
Nothing.

1088
01:07:53,654 --> 01:07:55,281
Miss Sedg-

1089
01:07:55,322 --> 01:07:59,224
Edie, I can help you.

1090
01:08:01,095 --> 01:08:04,258
You can have
what I've got here.

1091
01:08:04,298 --> 01:08:07,131
Oh, child, child.

1092
01:08:07,168 --> 01:08:09,796
Child.

1093
01:08:23,350 --> 01:08:26,046
Hello.

1094
01:08:26,086 --> 01:08:28,418
Andy, it's Edie!

1095
01:08:31,192 --> 01:08:33,490
He's not here.

1096
01:08:35,930 --> 01:08:39,195
So, Silver,

1097
01:08:39,233 --> 01:08:43,067
can- can- can
I borrow some money?

1098
01:08:45,172 --> 01:08:47,902
Yeah.

1099
01:08:47,942 --> 01:08:50,035
Let me have 50,
and I'll give you 10.

1100
01:08:50,077 --> 01:08:53,535
I'm serious.

1101
01:08:53,581 --> 01:08:56,015
You know, sweets,

1102
01:08:56,050 --> 01:08:58,712
Andy's not the only
game in town.

1103
01:08:58,752 --> 01:09:01,550
I have a friend Max.

1104
01:09:01,589 --> 01:09:03,989
He's friends
with a friend

1105
01:09:04,024 --> 01:09:06,686
who knows
Alfred Hitchcock.

1106
01:09:13,467 --> 01:09:15,901
I think it could be good
for your career.

1107
01:09:25,145 --> 01:09:27,010
I started to scheme

1108
01:09:27,047 --> 01:09:29,811
about how
to get drugs.

1109
01:09:29,850 --> 01:09:32,250
I shot heroin to come down
from speed

1110
01:09:32,286 --> 01:09:36,052
and keep
the big sadness at bay.

1111
01:09:38,626 --> 01:09:41,618
But I got completely
out of control.

1112
01:10:12,660 --> 01:10:15,823
She really is like
a glamorous Viking, isn't she?

1113
01:10:15,863 --> 01:10:18,627
An East Berlin original.

1114
01:10:34,258 --> 01:10:37,421
Well, we're sponsoring
a new band.

1115
01:10:37,461 --> 01:10:39,793
Oh, what are
they called?

1116
01:10:39,830 --> 01:10:41,297
- The Velvet Underground.
- Oh, yeah.

1117
01:10:41,332 --> 01:10:43,664
And since I don't believe
in painting any more,

1118
01:10:43,701 --> 01:10:47,432
we thought it
would be a nice-

1119
01:10:47,471 --> 01:10:50,998
A way of combining music,
films and art.

1120
01:10:51,041 --> 01:10:52,531
Nico, how about a photo?

1121
01:10:54,311 --> 01:10:57,007
Hello, Mum-mum.

1122
01:10:57,047 --> 01:11:00,107
How are you, dear?

1123
01:11:00,151 --> 01:11:03,052
Is- is Fuzzy there?

1124
01:11:03,087 --> 01:11:05,282
You're not going to ask
for money, are you, honey?

1125
01:11:05,322 --> 01:11:06,789
No, no.

1126
01:11:06,824 --> 01:11:10,191
I just wanted
to say hello.

1127
01:11:10,227 --> 01:11:12,491
Oh, yes, of course.

1128
01:11:12,530 --> 01:11:14,430
Let me get him.

1129
01:11:14,465 --> 01:11:17,593
Fuzzy, darling,
it's Edith on the phone.

1130
01:11:17,635 --> 01:11:19,398
You talk to her.

1131
01:11:19,437 --> 01:11:22,565
- You've got to talk to her.
- Fuzzy.

1132
01:11:22,606 --> 01:11:24,699
- It sounds like she's desperate.
- I hate the bitch.

1133
01:11:24,742 --> 01:11:26,733
Talk to her. She's your daughter.

1134
01:11:26,777 --> 01:11:28,836
Tell her to go make her movies.

1135
01:11:28,879 --> 01:11:31,177
He'd love to talk,
darling, but he's tied up at the moment.

1136
01:11:31,215 --> 01:11:33,183
- Take care, Mum-mum.
- He'll call you right back, okay?

1137
01:12:26,170 --> 01:12:28,798
I'm just so tired.

1138
01:12:31,242 --> 01:12:34,268
Andy Warhol superstar-
slash-socialite Edie Sedgwick

1139
01:12:34,311 --> 01:12:36,677
was taken to Lenox Hospital
today after starting a fire.

1140
01:12:36,714 --> 01:12:38,682
She almost burned down
the whole fucking place.

1141
01:12:38,816 --> 01:12:41,979
She suffered first-degree
burns on her arms and legs.

1142
01:12:42,019 --> 01:12:44,010
What do you want me
to do?

1143
01:12:46,524 --> 01:12:50,426
I don't know.
See if she needs anything.

1144
01:12:53,364 --> 01:12:55,355
I'd help her
if I could.

1145
01:13:24,204 --> 01:13:27,401
Richie, honey,

1146
01:13:27,440 --> 01:13:29,931
I need to ask
you a favor.

1147
01:13:29,976 --> 01:13:33,742
Richie, darling! It's been ages.
How's your father?

1148
01:13:33,780 --> 01:13:36,442
He just bought my mother
a 10-carat stone.

1149
01:13:36,483 --> 01:13:39,213
If anyone else, you'd think he was
screwing the Rockettes.

1150
01:13:41,321 --> 01:13:44,017
Diana, I'm calling
about Edie Sedgwick.

1151
01:13:44,057 --> 01:13:45,285
Yes.

1152
01:13:45,325 --> 01:13:47,520
She's been trying
to reach you.

1153
01:13:47,560 --> 01:13:49,551
I have her here.
I'm going to put her on.

1154
01:13:54,100 --> 01:13:56,762
- Hello.
- Edie.

1155
01:13:56,803 --> 01:13:59,567
Divine one,
how are you?

1156
01:13:59,606 --> 01:14:02,541
Your pictures
were incredible.

1157
01:14:03,977 --> 01:14:06,605
I'm afraid we can't sign
you right now, darling.

1158
01:14:06,646 --> 01:14:09,444
Why not?

1159
01:14:09,482 --> 01:14:11,450
The board feels-

1160
01:14:11,484 --> 01:14:13,384
they feel...

1161
01:14:13,420 --> 01:14:16,287
Andy Warhol's
mise-en-scène,

1162
01:14:16,322 --> 01:14:18,552
it's become too seedy.

1163
01:14:18,591 --> 01:14:21,458
The drugs, darling,
the riffraff.

1164
01:14:21,494 --> 01:14:24,952
The patina is damaged.
They think you've become vulgar.

1165
01:14:26,566 --> 01:14:29,933
Vulgar? How?

1166
01:14:29,969 --> 01:14:33,234
I don't know, but it's
better than being boring.

1167
01:14:33,273 --> 01:14:36,970
Now do take care
of yourself.

1168
01:14:44,017 --> 01:14:47,111
You what?

1169
01:14:49,222 --> 01:14:51,850
I hope you're happy.

1170
01:14:55,028 --> 01:14:58,191
Everyone in New York
is laughing at me.

1171
01:15:00,433 --> 01:15:02,526
I can't leave
my apartment.

1172
01:15:02,569 --> 01:15:04,560
I can't get a job.

1173
01:15:04,604 --> 01:15:07,164
Your movies have made
a fool out of me.

1174
01:15:07,207 --> 01:15:09,072
Oh, no. They've made
you famous, Edie,

1175
01:15:09,108 --> 01:15:11,668
and that's what
you wanted.

1176
01:15:11,711 --> 01:15:13,838
No one will have
anything to do with me

1177
01:15:13,880 --> 01:15:16,212
because of you.

1178
01:15:16,249 --> 01:15:18,911
But every teenage girl from Jersey
wants to look like you, Edie.

1179
01:15:18,952 --> 01:15:22,012
Andy, I have nothing.

1180
01:15:22,055 --> 01:15:25,320
You owe me that money.
I need that money.

1181
01:15:25,358 --> 01:15:28,987
But I gave you $50. I gave you money.
Did you spend it already?

1182
01:15:29,028 --> 01:15:31,326
50 fucking dollars?

1183
01:15:31,364 --> 01:15:32,797
I'm sure if you wait a year or two,

1184
01:15:32,832 --> 01:15:34,197
someone from Hollywood
will put you in a movie

1185
01:15:34,234 --> 01:15:36,964
with Tony Perkins. And then you can earn
all the money you want

1186
01:15:37,003 --> 01:15:38,334
and spend all that too.

1187
01:15:38,371 --> 01:15:40,498
You think that I'll
go to Hollywood?

1188
01:15:40,540 --> 01:15:44,169
You think I can't function without you?
I'll be fucking fine.

1189
01:15:44,210 --> 01:15:46,041
Are you going to live there

1190
01:15:46,079 --> 01:15:48,639
with your boyfriend
and his wife?

1191
01:15:54,821 --> 01:15:56,584
What?

1192
01:16:05,465 --> 01:16:08,457
You filthy,
filthy, fucking-

1193
01:16:08,501 --> 01:16:10,366
Edie, enough!

1194
01:16:10,403 --> 01:16:13,497
- You fucked me up!
- That's enough!

1195
01:16:13,540 --> 01:16:16,407
And your Factory!

1196
01:16:16,442 --> 01:16:19,275
You fucked me up
and you know it!

1197
01:16:19,312 --> 01:16:21,007
You look at me.

1198
01:16:21,047 --> 01:16:23,345
Look at me!

1199
01:16:43,979 --> 01:16:46,038
Andy...

1200
01:16:47,682 --> 01:16:50,242
who is this you
are talking about?

1201
01:16:53,255 --> 01:16:55,815
I don't know what to say
to her anymore.

1202
01:16:57,492 --> 01:16:59,517
And I don't know
what I did.

1203
01:17:00,662 --> 01:17:03,222
She's such
a beautiful girl,

1204
01:17:03,265 --> 01:17:04,994
but it's like she just
wants to be ugly now.

1205
01:17:05,033 --> 01:17:08,002
And I don't understand

1206
01:17:08,036 --> 01:17:10,596
why anybody
would want that.

1207
01:17:14,309 --> 01:17:16,777
How do you stop somebody
from not doing something

1208
01:17:16,811 --> 01:17:19,541
if they don't want to?

1209
01:17:19,581 --> 01:17:21,572
We will say a prayer
for her

1210
01:17:21,616 --> 01:17:23,709
and then we will
go and light a candle.

1211
01:17:23,752 --> 01:17:27,620
I never met anybody
like her before.

1212
01:17:48,476 --> 01:17:50,603
Who is he?

1213
01:17:50,645 --> 01:17:53,478
Don't you remember?

1214
01:17:53,515 --> 01:17:56,348
This is my friend, Max.

1215
01:17:56,384 --> 01:18:00,218
The guy who knows the guy
who knows Alfred Hitchcock.

1216
01:18:00,255 --> 01:18:03,315
Oh, right.

1217
01:18:04,726 --> 01:18:06,751
Is your-
is your friend

1218
01:18:06,795 --> 01:18:09,457
stealing my silverware?

1219
01:18:09,497 --> 01:18:12,432
No, he's just
borrowing it.

1220
01:18:12,467 --> 01:18:13,798
Is that okay?

1221
01:18:13,835 --> 01:18:17,464
Just because I let
your friend

1222
01:18:17,505 --> 01:18:19,029
fuck me last night

1223
01:18:19,074 --> 01:18:22,874
doesn't mean that he
can take my silver.

1224
01:18:22,911 --> 01:18:25,471
Did he film it?

1225
01:18:25,513 --> 01:18:29,142
Yes, and you were great.

1226
01:18:33,822 --> 01:18:37,815
- Are you done?
- Yeah, that's a wrap.

1227
01:18:39,961 --> 01:18:42,259
- How do I look?
- You look groovy.

1228
01:18:42,297 --> 01:18:44,595
Hey, Edie,

1229
01:18:44,632 --> 01:18:46,463
can he borrow
your coat?

1230
01:18:46,501 --> 01:18:49,493
That looks really
good on you.

1231
01:18:49,537 --> 01:18:50,868
Thanks.

1232
01:18:52,273 --> 01:18:54,798
All right, sweets,
I gotta go.

1233
01:18:54,843 --> 01:18:56,310
Don't- don't go.

1234
01:18:56,344 --> 01:18:59,472
Don't leave me now.

1235
01:18:59,514 --> 01:19:02,312
Maybe I'll come back later.

1236
01:19:02,350 --> 01:19:05,478
Don't forget to blow out
all these candles.

1237
01:19:07,155 --> 01:19:08,952
God, maybe you should
just sort of-

1238
01:19:12,660 --> 01:19:15,060
Ciao.

1239
01:19:18,500 --> 01:19:21,663
- Take off her coat, man.
- She said I could borrow it.

1240
01:19:21,703 --> 01:19:24,695
No no no. Either you take it off
or I'm gonna take it off for you.

1241
01:19:24,739 --> 01:19:27,606
- It's your choice.
- She just said that he could borrow-

1242
01:19:27,642 --> 01:19:30,167
Take off the fucking coat!

1243
01:19:30,211 --> 01:19:32,372
Hey, man,

1244
01:19:32,414 --> 01:19:34,712
just mellow out, man.

1245
01:19:34,749 --> 01:19:36,478
Now get the fuck
out of here.

1246
01:19:36,518 --> 01:19:39,316
- Get the fuck out of here!
- Okay.

1247
01:19:39,354 --> 01:19:42,551
We were just leaving,
man.

1248
01:19:44,335 --> 01:19:47,634
Syd, is that you?

1249
01:19:54,611 --> 01:19:56,442
Let me see.

1250
01:19:58,182 --> 01:19:59,740
What are you doing?

1251
01:19:59,783 --> 01:20:03,446
I said it all to him.

1252
01:20:03,487 --> 01:20:04,715
I told him.

1253
01:20:08,625 --> 01:20:10,252
I- I said it to Andy.

1254
01:20:10,294 --> 01:20:14,253
I said it all to him.
Is that why you're here?

1255
01:20:14,298 --> 01:20:18,064
Are we going upstate like he said?
'Cause if we are,

1256
01:20:18,102 --> 01:20:20,866
I just need to put
a few things into a bag.

1257
01:20:20,904 --> 01:20:22,565
He's out of town,
all right?

1258
01:20:22,606 --> 01:20:24,801
But maybe,
maybe when he gets back.

1259
01:20:24,842 --> 01:20:26,707
All right?

1260
01:20:28,045 --> 01:20:31,674
Did- did my father
call you?

1261
01:20:31,715 --> 01:20:33,114
Is that why-

1262
01:20:33,150 --> 01:20:35,710
is he gonna lock me
up again?

1263
01:20:35,753 --> 01:20:37,050
No.

1264
01:20:37,087 --> 01:20:40,181
Syd, will you stay-

1265
01:20:40,224 --> 01:20:43,352
- stay the night with me?
- No.

1266
01:20:43,394 --> 01:20:45,385
Edie.

1267
01:20:47,297 --> 01:20:49,492
Lately, I-

1268
01:20:52,102 --> 01:20:55,128
I feel like
I'm gonna die.

1269
01:20:55,172 --> 01:20:56,901
You're not
gonna die, Edie.

1270
01:20:59,143 --> 01:21:02,442
You're gonna be fine.
I promise.

1271
01:21:02,479 --> 01:21:05,175
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1272
01:21:08,152 --> 01:21:11,747
Hey, how about I buy
you something to eat?

1273
01:21:11,789 --> 01:21:14,553
Can I do that?

1274
01:21:18,562 --> 01:21:21,929
Looks like an accident.
It may be a while.

1275
01:21:23,167 --> 01:21:25,431
Where are we going, Syd?

1276
01:21:27,204 --> 01:21:29,798
I want to show
you something.

1277
01:21:34,044 --> 01:21:37,036
Do you remember
that girl?

1278
01:21:37,081 --> 01:21:38,639
Huh?

1279
01:21:41,251 --> 01:21:43,048
That's-

1280
01:21:43,087 --> 01:21:45,453
what was I thinking?

1281
01:21:45,489 --> 01:21:49,016
The only reason I ever
went to that class was because of you.

1282
01:21:50,394 --> 01:21:52,089
It's true.

1283
01:21:54,498 --> 01:21:57,058
Do you remember her?

1284
01:22:07,344 --> 01:22:09,335
No.

1285
01:22:17,721 --> 01:22:19,348
Edie!

1286
01:22:27,798 --> 01:22:31,734
I'm not saying that
anyone else is responsible.

1287
01:22:31,768 --> 01:22:33,360
I made decisions,

1288
01:22:33,403 --> 01:22:35,394
life decisions
that I regret.

1289
01:22:37,608 --> 01:22:41,009
But I really feel
like I can do this.

1290
01:22:42,379 --> 01:22:44,006
I can stay
off the drugs,

1291
01:22:44,047 --> 01:22:46,174
and I realize that it will
be a battle every day,

1292
01:22:46,216 --> 01:22:49,344
but so far

1293
01:22:49,386 --> 01:22:51,445
so good, right?

1294
01:22:53,123 --> 01:22:54,886
But I'm home.

1295
01:22:54,925 --> 01:22:58,122
Santa Barbara
is my home.

1296
01:23:00,764 --> 01:23:03,562
And I have a small show.
Did I tell you that?

1297
01:23:03,600 --> 01:23:05,363
I mean,
it's nothing major.

1298
01:23:05,402 --> 01:23:09,395
It's just in a frame shop,
but it's something.

1299
01:23:52,416 --> 01:23:55,977
I just think people forgot what emotions
were supposed to be.

1300
01:23:56,019 --> 01:23:58,146
I mean,
it's too hard to care.

1301
01:23:58,188 --> 01:24:00,850
I mean, you know,
I still care,

1302
01:24:00,891 --> 01:24:04,019
but it would just be so
much nicer not to care.

1303
01:24:04,061 --> 01:24:06,621
It's just easier
being detached.

1304
01:24:06,663 --> 01:24:08,756
What about Edie?

1305
01:24:08,799 --> 01:24:11,461
Oh, what about Edie?
I haven't seen her in years.

1306
01:24:11,501 --> 01:24:13,526
You know she died
yesterday?

1307
01:24:13,570 --> 01:24:15,561
Oh, yeah.

1308
01:24:15,606 --> 01:24:19,474
Do you think your breakup had something
to do with that detachment?

1309
01:24:19,509 --> 01:24:21,477
Well, it wasn't
a breakup.

1310
01:24:21,511 --> 01:24:25,242
I mean, that makes
it sound like we were-

1311
01:24:25,282 --> 01:24:28,445
I mean, this is gonna
be really hard if we have to- if-

1312
01:24:32,022 --> 01:24:34,013
You know, it was
just so long ago.

1313
01:24:34,057 --> 01:24:37,151
I mean, I hardly
knew her at all, so...

1314
01:24:46,903 --> 01:24:49,838
I wonder if people
are gonna remember us.

1315
01:24:49,873 --> 01:24:52,341
- What, when we're dead?
- Yeah.

1316
01:24:52,376 --> 01:24:55,675
I think people will talk about how
you changed the world.

1317
01:24:55,712 --> 01:24:58,510
I wonder what they'll say about you

1318
01:24:58,548 --> 01:25:00,482
in your obituary.

1319
01:25:00,517 --> 01:25:02,781
- I like that word.
- Nothing nice, I don't think.

1320
01:25:02,819 --> 01:25:05,117
Oh, no, come on. It'd say,

1321
01:25:05,155 --> 01:25:07,385
"Edith Minturn Sedgwick,

1322
01:25:07,424 --> 01:25:09,392
beautiful artist
and actress... "

1323
01:25:09,426 --> 01:25:11,394
"And all-around loon. "

1324
01:25:11,428 --> 01:25:13,658
"Remembered for setting
the world on fire... "

1325
01:25:13,697 --> 01:25:16,860
"And escaping the clutches
of her terrifying family. "

1326
01:25:16,900 --> 01:25:19,494
"Made friends
with everybody and anybody... "

1327
01:25:19,536 --> 01:25:22,505
"Creating chaos
and uproar wherever she went.

1328
01:25:22,539 --> 01:25:24,837
Divorced as many times
as she married,

1329
01:25:24,875 --> 01:25:27,639
she leaves only
good wishes behind. "

1330
01:25:29,212 --> 01:25:31,578
That's nice, isn't it?

1331
01:25:44,027 --> 01:25:46,518
Edie seemed
to understand from the beginning

1332
01:25:46,563 --> 01:25:48,292
her life
was going to be short.

1333
01:25:48,332 --> 01:25:49,731
She was a blip on
the radar suddenly.

1334
01:25:49,766 --> 01:25:51,495
It just blew out everybody.

1335
01:25:51,535 --> 01:25:53,901
You walk into a room
and Edie was there.

1336
01:25:53,937 --> 01:25:55,598
Edie was what you saw.

1337
01:25:55,639 --> 01:25:59,439
There was something
so vulnerable about Edie.

1338
01:25:59,476 --> 01:26:03,310
She was a person
that everybody adored

1339
01:26:03,347 --> 01:26:04,939
and kind of worshipped,

1340
01:26:04,981 --> 01:26:07,814
but you knew that she was
basically fragile.

1341
01:26:07,851 --> 01:26:09,512
Time sort of stopped
when you were with her.

1342
01:26:09,553 --> 01:26:11,748
She was
an exquisite creature.

1343
01:26:11,788 --> 01:26:14,518
She had sort of a gamine look.
Very long legs,

1344
01:26:14,558 --> 01:26:17,527
very pale face,
very pale lips.

1345
01:26:17,561 --> 01:26:19,290
And a waif, in a way.

1346
01:26:19,329 --> 01:26:22,457
And I think probably
the weakness of her showed there.

1347
01:26:22,499 --> 01:26:24,933
Andy was very struck by her.

1348
01:26:24,968 --> 01:26:27,095
Andy would always
invite somebody, to say,

1349
01:26:27,137 --> 01:26:29,105
"Would you want to be
in one of my movies?"

1350
01:26:29,139 --> 01:26:31,903
And of course, Edie took Andy
very seriously on that.

1351
01:26:31,942 --> 01:26:35,400
Who was Edie Sedgwick?
Edie Sedgwick was a combination

1352
01:26:35,445 --> 01:26:38,414
of all the tragic women
who came before her.

1353
01:26:38,448 --> 01:26:41,645
She looked great
in front of a camera.

1354
01:26:41,685 --> 01:26:43,778
And she loved being
in front of one.

1355
01:26:43,820 --> 01:26:46,311
Edie was taken advantage of,

1356
01:26:46,356 --> 01:26:49,553
and hugely because she
was so loving and trusting.

1357
01:26:49,593 --> 01:26:51,060
She was very trusting.

1358
01:26:51,094 --> 01:26:53,358
She looked into your eyes.

1359
01:26:53,397 --> 01:26:55,558
She listened to what
you had to say.

1360
01:26:55,599 --> 01:26:58,568
She made you believe that you were
the most important person

1361
01:26:58,602 --> 01:27:00,729
to her
or on the planet.

1362
01:27:00,771 --> 01:27:03,399
Yeah, I think Edie took on Andy

1363
01:27:03,440 --> 01:27:05,965
as the father
that she didn't have.

1364
01:27:06,009 --> 01:27:08,569
Everybody I know that really
knew her wanted to save her.

1365
01:27:08,612 --> 01:27:11,843
That was one of the things-
trying to keep her off drugs,

1366
01:27:11,882 --> 01:27:14,783
trying to get her
to pull her life together.

1367
01:27:14,818 --> 01:27:18,151
If you said "I love you,"
she just brightened up.

1368
01:27:18,188 --> 01:27:20,452
So you got
an immediate response,

1369
01:27:20,490 --> 01:27:23,254
and I think that's
how she caught people really strongly.

1370
01:27:23,293 --> 01:27:26,285
She had her own sense
of style,

1371
01:27:26,329 --> 01:27:28,297
which no one
had ever seen before.

1372
01:27:28,331 --> 01:27:30,492
She invented
an entirely new look.

1373
01:27:30,534 --> 01:27:33,628
She inspired us all to want
to take care of her.

1374
01:27:33,670 --> 01:27:36,366
But believe me,
that was some job.

1375
01:27:36,406 --> 01:27:38,499
And of course, she had
a terrible time with drugs

1376
01:27:38,542 --> 01:27:41,568
and also the character
that comes with that.

1377
01:27:41,611 --> 01:27:44,842
Endless searching
through her bag to try to find a key

1378
01:27:44,881 --> 01:27:48,078
or to try to find lipstick
or whatever.

1379
01:27:48,118 --> 01:27:50,052
But still
enchanting anyway.
