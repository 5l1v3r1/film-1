1
00:04:10,564 --> 00:04:12,722
You there, which way
to Pepperinge Eye?

2
00:04:12,816 --> 00:04:16,731
Couldn't say, sir. It said on the
wireless to paint out the signposts

3
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:19,490
in case the Nazis drop in.

4
00:04:19,573 --> 00:04:21,945
I'm not a Nazi!
I'm a British officer!

5
00:04:22,034 --> 00:04:26,032
That's what you'd say
if you was a Nazi, isn't it, sir?

6
00:04:26,121 --> 00:04:28,280
Drive on, corporal.

7
00:04:49,019 --> 00:04:51,854
Sorry to give you so many
but you do have six bedrooms.

8
00:04:51,939 --> 00:04:54,809
No trouble.
Anything to get the poor things away

9
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:57,901
from those terrible
bombings in London.

10
00:05:00,948 --> 00:05:03,617
What about us?

11
00:05:03,701 --> 00:05:06,618
- Oh, yes. What is your name?
- Rawlins, ma'am.

12
00:05:08,789 --> 00:05:11,410
Oh, yes. Here we are. Carrie.

13
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:13,160
Charles.

14
00:05:13,252 --> 00:05:15,209
Paul.

15
00:05:15,295 --> 00:05:17,965
You're for Miss Price.
I'm expecting her in.

16
00:05:18,048 --> 00:05:21,168
- Call out the navy
- I won't be a moment.

17
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:23,051
Please don't touch anything.

18
00:05:23,137 --> 00:05:25,544
Call out the tanks

19
00:05:25,639 --> 00:05:29,803
From the Cliffs of Dover,
call up the gulls

20
00:05:29,893 --> 00:05:34,354
And don't forget
the loyal territorials

21
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:38,568
But who's digging in here?
Who will defend

22
00:05:38,652 --> 00:05:42,864
Every inch of England,
no matter what they send?

23
00:05:42,948 --> 00:05:47,112
Who's standing firm
in our own front yard?

24
00:05:47,202 --> 00:05:51,496
The soldiers of the Old Home Guard,
that's who

25
00:05:51,582 --> 00:05:55,745
The soldiers of the Old Home Guard

26
00:05:55,836 --> 00:06:00,332
We wrote the story
of the old brigades

27
00:06:00,424 --> 00:06:04,671
We know the glory
of yesterday's parades

28
00:06:04,762 --> 00:06:08,842
Who's standing firm
in our own front yard?

29
00:06:08,932 --> 00:06:13,013
The soldiers of the Old Home Guard,
that's who

30
00:06:13,103 --> 00:06:18,061
The soldiers of the Old Home Guard

31
00:06:19,651 --> 00:06:22,818
- Halt!
- Carry on, sergeant.

32
00:06:22,905 --> 00:06:25,941
Captain Greer, sir,
from headquarters at Tidbury,

33
00:06:26,033 --> 00:06:28,156
here to check military preparations.

34
00:06:28,243 --> 00:06:31,114
Tell them Pepperinge Eye
has matters well in hand.

35
00:06:31,205 --> 00:06:34,656
Nevertheless, I...
What on earth is that?

36
00:06:43,384 --> 00:06:46,634
Good morning, General.
I received your message, Mrs Hobday.

37
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:49,591
- I assume my parcel has arrived.
- It's in the office.

38
00:06:49,682 --> 00:06:50,761
How lovely.

39
00:06:53,268 --> 00:06:56,186
- Who is that?
- Miss Price. Splendid woman.

40
00:06:56,271 --> 00:06:58,560
Her late father served with me.

41
00:06:58,649 --> 00:07:01,318
What does she burn in this?
It smells like sulphur.

42
00:07:01,402 --> 00:07:04,687
Ridiculous! One can't make
motor fuel out of sulphur!

43
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:09,608
Here we are. Another object from
Professor Emelius Browne in London.

44
00:07:09,702 --> 00:07:12,786
- Thank you.
- Is it what you expected?

45
00:07:12,871 --> 00:07:18,114
- I imagine so.
- He sent you a cat last time.

46
00:07:20,421 --> 00:07:23,624
- Professor Browne is well?
- I haven't the faintest idea.

47
00:07:23,716 --> 00:07:26,716
Are we to have
the pleasure of meeting him?

48
00:07:26,802 --> 00:07:29,838
I doubt it. I don't know
Professor Browne personally.

49
00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:33,097
- Was there something else?
- Yes. Would you come this way?

50
00:07:33,183 --> 00:07:35,853
- I'm very anxious to get home.
- Come along, please.

51
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:42,309
- Get down, Charlie. I want a ride!
- Bash him one!

52
00:07:42,401 --> 00:07:44,477
Stop it this instant!

53
00:07:45,904 --> 00:07:48,395
Children, this is Miss Price.

54
00:07:48,490 --> 00:07:52,025
Carrie, Charles and Paul Rawlins,
all the way from London.

55
00:07:52,119 --> 00:07:54,325
- How do you do?
- How are you, miss?

56
00:07:54,413 --> 00:07:58,790
The government are trying to evacuate
children into the country.

57
00:07:58,876 --> 00:08:02,161
- Very sensible.
- Today they sent us 45.

58
00:08:02,254 --> 00:08:06,252
And I've had to find homes
for all of them at very short notice.

59
00:08:06,342 --> 00:08:13,803
These are the last three. All right,
children. Pick up your things.

60
00:08:13,891 --> 00:08:16,975
You're not suggesting I take
these children into my house?

61
00:08:17,061 --> 00:08:21,272
- Exactly.
- That's quite out of the question.

62
00:08:21,357 --> 00:08:23,433
Children and I don't get on.

63
00:08:24,068 --> 00:08:27,437
I'll believe you, miss.
Come on. Back to London.

64
00:08:27,529 --> 00:08:28,988
Be quiet.

65
00:08:29,573 --> 00:08:31,815
Besides, I have important work to do.

66
00:08:31,909 --> 00:08:34,993
Miss Price, you do have
that entire house to yourself.

67
00:08:35,079 --> 00:08:39,622
According to the Ministry of
Civil Defence, you have no choice.

68
00:08:39,708 --> 00:08:40,989
I see.

69
00:08:41,085 --> 00:08:43,658
If that is the case
I shall take them into my house,

70
00:08:43,754 --> 00:08:47,704
with the understanding that you find
another home as soon as possible.

71
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:49,591
Fine. Come along.

72
00:08:55,099 --> 00:08:58,218
Good morning, Miss Price.
There they are!

73
00:08:58,310 --> 00:09:01,228
Oh, Miss Price, what a charitable
thing you are doing,

74
00:09:01,313 --> 00:09:03,851
taking in these
poor unfortunates from the city.

75
00:09:03,941 --> 00:09:07,689
- Hold this very carefully.
- I wonder if I may drop by later.

76
00:09:07,778 --> 00:09:11,396
- Why?
- Consider their spiritual needs.

77
00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:14,574
That won't be necessary.
They won't be with me for long.

78
00:09:36,223 --> 00:09:38,381
My parcel, please.

79
00:09:38,475 --> 00:09:40,551
Bring your things inside.

80
00:09:43,772 --> 00:09:46,477
- Bit murky, ain't it?
- Yeah.

81
00:09:46,567 --> 00:09:49,733
Not another house
round here for miles.

82
00:09:52,906 --> 00:09:55,777
- Wipe your feet.
- Big place, this.

83
00:09:55,868 --> 00:09:58,785
- Who else lives here?
- I live alone.

84
00:09:58,871 --> 00:10:00,863
It suits my purpose.

85
00:10:02,624 --> 00:10:05,294
All right. Come along, everybody.

86
00:10:16,597 --> 00:10:19,052
Sorry, miss. The cat startled us.

87
00:10:19,141 --> 00:10:22,177
No need for alarm.
You just frightened him.

88
00:10:23,103 --> 00:10:26,188
Yeah, he's scared to death.
You can see that!

89
00:10:28,108 --> 00:10:31,892
- What do you call your cat?
- I don't give animals silly names.

90
00:10:31,987 --> 00:10:36,234
I call him Cosmic Creepers
because that's the name he came with.

91
00:10:36,325 --> 00:10:39,528
You will sleep in here.
This was my father's bedroom.

92
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:41,862
Be very careful of everything in it.

93
00:10:41,955 --> 00:10:44,791
- You boys take the bed there.
- All right, miss.

94
00:10:44,875 --> 00:10:46,915
- What was your name?
- Carrie, miss.

95
00:10:47,002 --> 00:10:50,252
- You sleep in the sofa in there.
- Thank you, miss.

96
00:10:50,339 --> 00:10:53,838
- Is that all you brought?
- We ain't exactly burdened down.

97
00:10:53,926 --> 00:10:56,215
Travel light, that's us.

98
00:10:57,179 --> 00:10:59,219
I don't think this is going to work

99
00:10:59,306 --> 00:11:01,465
but it seems
that I have no alternative.

100
00:11:01,558 --> 00:11:03,717
We'll do our best, miss.
Really, we will.

101
00:11:03,811 --> 00:11:07,014
Thank you, Carrie.
The bathroom is along the landing.

102
00:11:07,106 --> 00:11:10,439
- Supper is at 6:00. You will wash...
- Wash?

103
00:11:10,526 --> 00:11:13,776
You will wash yourselves
otherwise there will be no supper.

104
00:11:13,862 --> 00:11:16,188
Is that clear?

105
00:11:17,658 --> 00:11:21,109
A house of horror.
That's what we've come to.

106
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:32,088
Please don't bother to whisper.
I'm exceptionally keen of hearing.

107
00:11:32,172 --> 00:11:34,331
You are planning
to run back to London.

108
00:11:34,425 --> 00:11:36,713
Please do your plotting elsewhere

109
00:11:36,802 --> 00:11:38,629
where I shan't have to listen to it.

110
00:11:38,762 --> 00:11:41,432
I don't know much
about what children eat.

111
00:11:41,515 --> 00:11:43,508
You'll have to make do as I do.

112
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:46,091
Is there anything in particular
that you fancy?

113
00:11:46,186 --> 00:11:48,891
Sausage and mash,
bubble and squeak,

114
00:11:48,981 --> 00:11:50,973
toad in the hole, fried fish...

115
00:11:51,066 --> 00:11:52,644
Anything at all.

116
00:11:52,735 --> 00:11:55,819
You won't find any fried foods
in this house.

117
00:11:55,904 --> 00:11:57,612
- No fried food?
- No.

118
00:11:57,698 --> 00:11:59,904
How do you keep your health?

119
00:11:59,992 --> 00:12:01,700
Cabbage buds, rosehips,

120
00:12:01,785 --> 00:12:07,076
hyssop seed, elm bark,
wattle yeast and stewed nettles.

121
00:13:02,554 --> 00:13:04,346
"Dear Madam. With this shipment,

122
00:13:04,431 --> 00:13:07,136
the Emelius Browne
College of Witchcraft

123
00:13:07,226 --> 00:13:09,099
sends you its congratulations

124
00:13:09,186 --> 00:13:12,637
on qualifying for the first degree
of your chosen calling."

125
00:13:12,731 --> 00:13:16,563
"You may now call yourself
'apprentice witch'."

126
00:13:17,569 --> 00:13:20,357
"Yours faithfully, Emelius Browne."

127
00:13:27,371 --> 00:13:29,529
My first broom.

128
00:13:33,919 --> 00:13:35,959
Time to go. Everybody up.

129
00:13:38,090 --> 00:13:40,415
Wake up, Paul.
We're going back to London.

130
00:13:40,968 --> 00:13:43,210
Let's see how we fly this thing.

131
00:13:43,971 --> 00:13:46,047
Here we are.

132
00:13:47,558 --> 00:13:50,512
"Clasp the broom with both hands."

133
00:13:51,270 --> 00:13:53,393
Yes, of course.

134
00:14:00,946 --> 00:14:03,402
"Never astride the broom."
Oh, yes, of course.

135
00:14:03,490 --> 00:14:07,073
"A witch is always a lady unless
circumstances dictate otherwise."

136
00:14:07,161 --> 00:14:10,695
"Take an easy, graceful
sideways position."

137
00:14:10,789 --> 00:14:15,451
Of course, that's much better.
An easy, graceful sideways position.

138
00:14:15,544 --> 00:14:18,664
There we are. How's that?

139
00:14:20,215 --> 00:14:23,169
"To start up the broom,
your basic formula:

140
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:27,128
La kipo necriff scrumpet leech!"

141
00:14:29,516 --> 00:14:31,675
I wasn't ready!

142
00:14:52,206 --> 00:14:54,163
Now watch this.

143
00:14:58,295 --> 00:14:59,837
Here we go.

144
00:15:21,527 --> 00:15:24,018
It's going to be
a little different this time.

145
00:15:29,702 --> 00:15:32,275
All right. I know it's not ladylike.

146
00:16:26,216 --> 00:16:28,209
What's the matter?

147
00:16:30,679 --> 00:16:32,921
- How does she do that?
- She's a witch.

148
00:16:33,015 --> 00:16:35,684
That's the sort of thing witches do.

149
00:16:53,786 --> 00:16:56,407
She don't fly good, do she?

150
00:17:02,252 --> 00:17:05,503
- She's crashed!
- Now's our chance to hop it!

151
00:17:05,589 --> 00:17:09,290
- Suppose she's hurt.
- Go on! You can't hurt a witch.

152
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:11,719
Look out!

153
00:17:19,019 --> 00:17:21,806
She's proper cross now.
Let's get away from here.

154
00:17:21,897 --> 00:17:25,313
Hang on. I'm having a bit of a think.

155
00:17:25,401 --> 00:17:27,358
A witch she is, says you.

156
00:17:27,444 --> 00:17:30,066
Then let's use the old loaf, says I.

157
00:17:30,155 --> 00:17:33,738
- Let's get back to London.
- What we have here is an opportunity.

158
00:17:33,826 --> 00:17:37,277
She don't want anyone
to know she's a witch, does she?

159
00:17:37,371 --> 00:17:40,491
- Not ruddy likely.
- That's the opportunity.

160
00:17:40,582 --> 00:17:43,667
And I intend to make
the most of it. Come on.

161
00:17:44,503 --> 00:17:47,076
- Bran porridge.
- Thank you, miss.

162
00:17:47,172 --> 00:17:49,248
Very healthful, I'm sure!

163
00:17:50,926 --> 00:17:54,509
- Hurt your foot, Miss Price?
- Just twisted my ankle.

164
00:17:54,596 --> 00:17:57,716
- Sorry to hear that.
- Thank you. It's nothing serious.

165
00:17:58,726 --> 00:18:01,513
Lovely weather for flying last night.

166
00:18:06,358 --> 00:18:08,814
Why did you say that, Charles?

167
00:18:08,902 --> 00:18:11,987
Game's up, Miss Price.
We know what you are.

168
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:15,031
I see.

169
00:18:17,703 --> 00:18:21,036
Don't worry, Miss Price.
No one's gonna peach on you.

170
00:18:22,249 --> 00:18:26,461
Thank you. I should be most grateful
if you didn't tell anyone.

171
00:18:26,545 --> 00:18:30,673
Course there would have to be one
or two little changes made round here.

172
00:18:30,758 --> 00:18:34,506
I mean, I'd like to see an occasional
sausage on the table here.

173
00:18:34,595 --> 00:18:37,264
- A bit of strawberry jam.
- Charlie!

174
00:18:37,348 --> 00:18:40,681
Let me handle this.
And another thing, Miss Price.

175
00:18:40,768 --> 00:18:44,717
There will be no more of this wash,
wash, wash, morning and night.

176
00:18:44,813 --> 00:18:46,972
Anything else?

177
00:18:47,066 --> 00:18:50,565
Now you mention it,
I could do with a bit of lolly.

178
00:18:51,278 --> 00:18:53,105
Lolly?

179
00:18:53,197 --> 00:18:55,735
Cash. Cold, hard cash.

180
00:18:55,824 --> 00:18:58,196
You must have buckets of it.

181
00:18:58,285 --> 00:19:02,698
The most accomplished of witches
can't make money out of thin air.

182
00:19:02,790 --> 00:19:05,494
Have you ever heard of a rich witch?

183
00:19:05,584 --> 00:19:10,045
Be that as it may,
you don't want us to blab, do you?

184
00:19:10,130 --> 00:19:13,215
Have you considered
what danger you might be in?

185
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:16,135
I am a witch, you know.

186
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:19,505
What will you do?
Turn me into a toad?

187
00:19:19,598 --> 00:19:22,089
Lovely. A toad with pink eyes.

188
00:19:23,143 --> 00:19:27,058
- I might just do that.
- Go on, then. I dare you.

189
00:19:27,147 --> 00:19:28,642
Very well, Charles.

190
00:19:31,443 --> 00:19:34,943
- You shouldn't have said that to her.
- She don't frighten me.

191
00:19:35,030 --> 00:19:36,939
She can't even ride a proper broom.

192
00:19:37,032 --> 00:19:39,191
Excuse me, Charles.

193
00:19:39,284 --> 00:19:42,155
Filigree, apogee,

194
00:19:42,246 --> 00:19:45,579
pedigree, perigee.

195
00:19:47,167 --> 00:19:49,326
Oh, Charlie!

196
00:19:50,379 --> 00:19:52,786
That's better than a toad!
That's a rabbit!

197
00:19:52,881 --> 00:19:55,551
Bother! I never seem
to be able to manage toads.

198
00:20:00,556 --> 00:20:02,798
Stop! Leave him alone!

199
00:20:04,935 --> 00:20:08,470
- Don't let Charlie get hurt.
- My spells don't last very long.

200
00:20:08,564 --> 00:20:10,391
I'm just an apprentice witch.

201
00:20:21,827 --> 00:20:23,867
Look out, Charlie!

202
00:20:32,588 --> 00:20:35,873
You flaming brute!

203
00:20:36,925 --> 00:20:40,259
I'll teach you to do that to me!

204
00:20:40,346 --> 00:20:43,430
Let Cosmic Creepers alone.
Weren't his fault.

205
00:20:44,016 --> 00:20:45,427
I'm afraid it's my fault.

206
00:20:45,517 --> 00:20:47,843
Bad enough not being able
to manage a broom.

207
00:20:47,936 --> 00:20:51,140
I can't perform
a simple, basic spell.

208
00:20:51,231 --> 00:20:55,229
You dared her to do it.
I don't see why we can't all be friends.

209
00:20:55,319 --> 00:20:57,810
Maybe she's not a wicked witch.

210
00:20:57,905 --> 00:20:59,897
Of course I'm not!

211
00:20:59,990 --> 00:21:03,240
- See?
- If only I could trust you.

212
00:21:03,327 --> 00:21:07,194
You see, the work I'm doing
is so important to the war effort.

213
00:21:07,289 --> 00:21:10,954
- How do you mean?
- I mean exceptionally important.

214
00:21:11,043 --> 00:21:12,834
Most secret.

215
00:21:13,504 --> 00:21:16,125
What do you say, Charlie?
We can keep a secret.

216
00:21:16,215 --> 00:21:19,749
Yeah. If someone
made it worth our while.

217
00:21:20,844 --> 00:21:21,959
I don't follow.

218
00:21:22,054 --> 00:21:25,968
Simple. You give us something
valuable to seal the pact.

219
00:21:26,058 --> 00:21:28,763
Oh, Charlie,
don't try to be clever again.

220
00:21:28,852 --> 00:21:30,892
It's for our own protection,
ain't it?

221
00:21:30,979 --> 00:21:35,143
If we broke the pact, we'd have
to give back the valuable object.

222
00:21:35,234 --> 00:21:38,400
I think it's an excellent idea.

223
00:21:38,487 --> 00:21:43,528
I wonder what I could give you.
Would you settle for one of my spells?

224
00:21:43,617 --> 00:21:45,823
Bet that's not worth much.

225
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:48,660
Come with me.

226
00:21:52,543 --> 00:21:56,243
- I like you better as a rabbit.
- Shut up, you.

227
00:21:56,338 --> 00:21:58,082
Well, I never had a rabbit.

228
00:22:00,134 --> 00:22:02,589
Careful what you touch in here.

229
00:22:04,763 --> 00:22:06,970
Rum sort of place, ain't it?

230
00:22:08,267 --> 00:22:11,600
When I signed for my witchcraft
course there was a free bonus,

231
00:22:11,687 --> 00:22:15,601
a marvellous travelling spell
if you paid in advance.

232
00:22:15,691 --> 00:22:17,897
I think I'll give you that one.

233
00:22:17,985 --> 00:22:20,476
- Is it valuable?
- Certainly.

234
00:22:24,116 --> 00:22:26,524
Poisoned dragon's liver?

235
00:22:28,495 --> 00:22:32,279
You mean you poison the dragon
or just the liver?

236
00:22:32,374 --> 00:22:35,743
It comes prepared.
It's part of the school equipment.

237
00:22:35,836 --> 00:22:38,505
Here we are. The travelling spell.

238
00:22:38,589 --> 00:22:40,665
Everybody gather round.

239
00:22:42,843 --> 00:22:44,717
All right now. Let's see.

240
00:22:44,803 --> 00:22:47,473
Does any one of you have
a bracelet or a ring?

241
00:22:47,556 --> 00:22:50,510
- Something that you can twist.
- No, Miss Price.

242
00:22:50,601 --> 00:22:54,266
- What about you, Paul?
- Always carry a few things around.

243
00:22:54,355 --> 00:22:58,933
Never know when they might come
in useful. Piece of blue glass.

244
00:22:59,026 --> 00:23:00,900
Lovely bit of string.

245
00:23:02,071 --> 00:23:04,028
Horseshoe nail.

246
00:23:05,741 --> 00:23:07,116
What's that?

247
00:23:07,201 --> 00:23:09,739
Knob from the bed upstairs.

248
00:23:09,828 --> 00:23:13,992
- It twists, don't it?
- Yeah. Twisted right off.

249
00:23:14,083 --> 00:23:16,455
Yes, I think that will be all right.

250
00:23:16,543 --> 00:23:19,912
Carrie, turn the light down
a little bit, will you?

251
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:34,387
Hellebore, henbane, aconite...

252
00:23:37,606 --> 00:23:41,307
glow-worm fire, firefly light!

253
00:23:44,321 --> 00:23:46,693
There. Isn't that pretty?

254
00:23:46,782 --> 00:23:48,940
Is that all we get?

255
00:23:49,034 --> 00:23:52,284
This knob will now work
the famous travelling spell.

256
00:23:52,371 --> 00:23:55,040
And what's
the famous travelling spell?

257
00:23:55,124 --> 00:23:57,697
- How does it work?
- You take this knob

258
00:23:57,793 --> 00:23:59,786
and put it back on the bed upstairs.

259
00:23:59,878 --> 00:24:02,416
Then turn it smartly
a quarter turn to the left

260
00:24:02,506 --> 00:24:05,756
then in a firm, clear voice,
tell it where you want to go

261
00:24:05,843 --> 00:24:07,966
and the bed will take you there.

262
00:24:08,053 --> 00:24:09,084
Go on!

263
00:24:09,179 --> 00:24:12,928
- Will it really?
- I see no reason to think otherwise.

264
00:24:13,976 --> 00:24:16,681
Thank you for the lovely gift.

265
00:24:16,770 --> 00:24:20,768
Sorry, but it belongs to Paul. He's the
only one who can work the spell.

266
00:24:20,858 --> 00:24:23,230
- Me?
- Yes.

267
00:24:23,318 --> 00:24:26,485
That's right. My knob, weren't it?

268
00:24:26,572 --> 00:24:28,280
That's the way the spell works.

269
00:24:28,365 --> 00:24:31,117
Nice mess he'll make of things.

270
00:24:33,412 --> 00:24:36,199
Oh, bother.
You children run upstairs.

271
00:24:36,290 --> 00:24:39,125
Don't try anything with the bedknob
till I get back.

272
00:24:40,794 --> 00:24:42,870
"Dear Madam,
it grieves me to inform you

273
00:24:42,963 --> 00:24:47,091
that we have been forced to close
down our College of Witchcraft."

274
00:24:47,176 --> 00:24:50,342
"This means that we shall not
be sending you the final lesson

275
00:24:50,429 --> 00:24:52,837
in which you expressed
so much interest."

276
00:24:56,101 --> 00:24:59,719
- What's keeping you?
- I've had some very bad news.

277
00:24:59,813 --> 00:25:01,972
Is there anything we can do?

278
00:25:02,066 --> 00:25:04,189
No. No, thank you.

279
00:25:05,361 --> 00:25:06,819
Yes.

280
00:25:06,904 --> 00:25:09,573
Yes, there is something
that Paul can do.

281
00:25:09,656 --> 00:25:11,945
- Me?
- I need the bedknob back.

282
00:25:12,034 --> 00:25:16,779
- I must get to London.
- No. I want to go to the jungle.

283
00:25:16,872 --> 00:25:19,161
Come with me, Paul.

284
00:25:23,712 --> 00:25:26,168
Now, Paul.
Ridiculous as it may seem

285
00:25:26,256 --> 00:25:28,664
to have to explain this
to a six-year-old,

286
00:25:28,759 --> 00:25:32,210
- I do need your help.
- Go ahead.

287
00:25:32,304 --> 00:25:34,926
I was expecting
a very important spell in the mail

288
00:25:35,015 --> 00:25:38,550
from my teacher, Professor Emelius
Browne, and it hasn't come.

289
00:25:38,644 --> 00:25:40,933
What's that got to do with my knob?

290
00:25:41,021 --> 00:25:44,188
I must go to London immediately
and see Professor Browne.

291
00:25:44,274 --> 00:25:49,649
With his help, we may be able
to bring this war to a successful end.

292
00:25:49,738 --> 00:25:51,778
That is why I need the knob.

293
00:25:51,865 --> 00:25:53,941
What is your decision?

294
00:26:00,541 --> 00:26:02,747
Thank you, Paul.

295
00:26:05,170 --> 00:26:07,708
I brought this for your hair.
It may be windy.

296
00:26:07,798 --> 00:26:09,791
Thank you. It's ever so nice.

297
00:26:09,883 --> 00:26:12,671
Paul, have you been
to the bathroom?

298
00:26:12,761 --> 00:26:14,670
- Twice.
- Good.

299
00:26:14,763 --> 00:26:17,089
Charles, put on something warmer.

300
00:26:17,182 --> 00:26:19,305
The bed may travel quite fast.

301
00:26:19,393 --> 00:26:22,477
I'm not going.
I'm staying right here.

302
00:26:22,563 --> 00:26:24,520
But why?

303
00:26:24,606 --> 00:26:29,601
All that rubbish about a travelling bed.
It won't work. That's why.

304
00:26:29,695 --> 00:26:32,482
Carrie, help me to pull the bed out.

305
00:26:32,573 --> 00:26:35,858
We don't want to scratch the wall
when we take off.

306
00:26:36,493 --> 00:26:39,411
How's a ruddy big bed like that
gonna get out of this room

307
00:26:39,496 --> 00:26:42,865
with those little windows?

308
00:26:42,958 --> 00:26:46,623
I don't know. There's a great many
things about magic that I don't know.

309
00:26:46,712 --> 00:26:49,333
- We'll just have to find out.
- Lovely!

310
00:26:49,423 --> 00:26:51,297
Just leave me out of it.

311
00:26:51,383 --> 00:26:53,506
I don't fancy
making a fool of myself.

312
00:26:54,428 --> 00:26:58,011
What's come over you lately, Charlie?
You're no fun any more.

313
00:26:58,098 --> 00:27:02,226
Help me tidy up. We don't want
to go to London with an unmade bed.

314
00:27:02,311 --> 00:27:05,016
- How old is Charles?
- Eleven, going on twelve.

315
00:27:05,105 --> 00:27:10,444
I see. That's what my father used
to call the age of not believing.

316
00:27:10,527 --> 00:27:12,485
What's that supposed to be?

317
00:27:13,614 --> 00:27:17,279
When you rush around
in hopeless circles

318
00:27:17,368 --> 00:27:21,828
Searching everywhere
for something true

319
00:27:21,914 --> 00:27:26,243
You're at the age of not believing

320
00:27:26,335 --> 00:27:29,538
When all the make-believe
is through

321
00:27:29,630 --> 00:27:32,002
That's Charlie to a tee.

322
00:27:32,091 --> 00:27:35,709
When you set aside
your childhood heroes

323
00:27:35,803 --> 00:27:40,180
And your dreams are lost
upon a shelf

324
00:27:40,265 --> 00:27:44,927
You're at the age of not believing

325
00:27:45,020 --> 00:27:49,481
And worst of all you doubt yourself

326
00:27:49,566 --> 00:27:51,144
Throw that away.

327
00:27:51,235 --> 00:27:55,695
You're a castaway
where no one hears you

328
00:27:55,781 --> 00:27:59,731
On a barren isle in a lonely sea

329
00:27:59,827 --> 00:28:01,404
What's that? Poetry?

330
00:28:01,495 --> 00:28:04,698
Where did all the happy endings go?

331
00:28:04,790 --> 00:28:09,084
Where can all the good times be?

332
00:28:09,169 --> 00:28:11,292
Everyone on the bed who's going.

333
00:28:11,380 --> 00:28:15,212
You must face the age
of not believing

334
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:19,298
Doubting everything you ever knew

335
00:28:19,388 --> 00:28:20,419
The knob.

336
00:28:20,514 --> 00:28:25,093
Until at last you start believing

337
00:28:25,185 --> 00:28:30,606
There's something wonderful in you

338
00:28:31,567 --> 00:28:33,476
Lovely sentiment, I'm sure.

339
00:28:33,569 --> 00:28:35,941
- Are you ready, Paul?
- Yes, Miss Price.

340
00:28:36,030 --> 00:28:37,440
Repeat after me.

341
00:28:38,407 --> 00:28:42,903
Take us to
Professor Emelius Browne...

342
00:28:49,209 --> 00:28:50,241
Very good.

343
00:28:50,336 --> 00:28:55,163
Headmaster, Correspondence
College of Witchcraft.

344
00:29:00,846 --> 00:29:03,419
Of Witchcraft, London.

345
00:29:06,101 --> 00:29:09,933
When I say go,
tap the knob three times

346
00:29:10,022 --> 00:29:12,892
and turn it a quarter turn
to the left.

347
00:29:14,318 --> 00:29:17,070
- Left...
- That's it.

348
00:29:17,154 --> 00:29:20,357
We'd better hold on tight.

349
00:29:20,449 --> 00:29:23,236
The behaviour of the bed
is something I'm not sure of.

350
00:29:23,327 --> 00:29:25,996
Let me breathe a little.

351
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:29,994
All right, Paul. Ready? Go.

352
00:29:30,876 --> 00:29:34,327
One... two... three...

353
00:30:31,770 --> 00:30:33,644
- Is this London?
- Course it is!

354
00:30:33,731 --> 00:30:37,313
- Smell that lovely sooty air.
- Marvellous, ain't it?

355
00:30:37,401 --> 00:30:40,271
- Charles, are you convinced?
- Not yet I ain't.

356
00:30:40,362 --> 00:30:42,734
I don't see no Professor Browne.

357
00:30:42,823 --> 00:30:45,444
Neither do I.
You children look after the bed

358
00:30:45,534 --> 00:30:47,740
while I make enquiries for Mr Browne.

359
00:30:50,122 --> 00:30:54,416
- I told you this bed wouldn't work.
- Don't start that again.

360
00:30:54,501 --> 00:30:59,543
It didn't work. It was supposed
to take us to Professor Browne.

361
00:31:00,466 --> 00:31:04,510
- "Professor Browne."
- Come on!

362
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:18,477
Ladies and gentlemen,
gather round, please.

363
00:31:20,277 --> 00:31:23,812
Please note the name:
Professor Emelius Browne.

364
00:31:23,906 --> 00:31:27,322
I am here to divert, to amuse,

365
00:31:27,409 --> 00:31:29,616
and, yes, even to help you.

366
00:31:29,703 --> 00:31:33,072
- There he is!
- It is not what things are...

367
00:31:35,584 --> 00:31:37,577
It is what they seem to be.

368
00:31:37,670 --> 00:31:38,701
Is that not so?

369
00:31:39,254 --> 00:31:41,543
That ain't the kind
of professor I expected.

370
00:31:41,632 --> 00:31:45,250
I'm not sure it's the kind
Miss Price expected, either.

371
00:31:45,928 --> 00:31:49,261
What effect a little smoke is...

372
00:31:49,765 --> 00:31:51,674
with a dash of hocus-pocus

373
00:31:51,767 --> 00:31:53,806
and the scent of burning...

374
00:31:55,396 --> 00:31:58,065
and the scent
of burning sulphur in the air.

375
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:02,400
And now, for my next trick,
may I draw your attention

376
00:32:02,486 --> 00:32:05,238
to this solid piece
of ordinary window glass,

377
00:32:05,322 --> 00:32:08,525
framed in an ordinary
unprepared frame.

378
00:32:08,617 --> 00:32:12,829
May I also draw your attention
to this perfectly ordinary steel nail.

379
00:32:12,913 --> 00:32:15,036
Now I shall place the framed glass

380
00:32:15,124 --> 00:32:17,163
in this brown, unprepared...

381
00:32:17,251 --> 00:32:19,374
Unprepared, mark you...

382
00:32:19,461 --> 00:32:21,952
Unprepared brown paper bag.

383
00:32:22,047 --> 00:32:26,543
I shall now attempt to drive
the steel nail through the glass

384
00:32:26,635 --> 00:32:29,173
without breaking the glass.

385
00:32:29,263 --> 00:32:31,302
"Impossible!" I hear you say.

386
00:32:31,390 --> 00:32:33,014
We shall see.

387
00:32:37,354 --> 00:32:40,225
He ain't very good,
even if he is a professor.

388
00:32:40,315 --> 00:32:43,020
I tell you what I'm going to do.
No, please don't go.

389
00:32:43,110 --> 00:32:47,238
Don't leave now
and regret lost opportunities later.

390
00:32:55,414 --> 00:33:00,123
You, young sir. Would you care
to warble like the storied nightingale?

391
00:33:00,210 --> 00:33:02,618
With this inexpensive device,

392
00:33:02,713 --> 00:33:06,296
you can charm the very birds
down from the trees, like so.

393
00:33:10,804 --> 00:33:13,378
- How much?
- For you, sir, one penny.

394
00:33:14,391 --> 00:33:16,598
One copper coin of the realm.

395
00:33:24,401 --> 00:33:27,735
Carrie, I'm very surprised
at you wandering off like this.

396
00:33:27,821 --> 00:33:31,321
We found him for you, miss.
We found Professor Browne.

397
00:33:31,408 --> 00:33:34,078
Don't work. I've been cheated!

398
00:33:34,161 --> 00:33:37,411
Is that Professor Browne?

399
00:33:37,498 --> 00:33:39,870
It is indeed, my dear.
How may I serve you?

400
00:33:39,958 --> 00:33:46,293
Would you be interested in the mating
call of the Brazilian bird of love?

401
00:33:47,424 --> 00:33:48,622
Very useful, eh?

402
00:33:48,717 --> 00:33:52,762
You are the headmaster of the
Emelius Browne College of Witchcraft?

403
00:33:52,846 --> 00:33:56,346
The late headmaster.
The college, alas, is now defunct.

404
00:33:56,433 --> 00:33:58,889
Professor Browne,
I am one of your pupils.

405
00:33:58,977 --> 00:34:03,604
My dear lady, you are indeed
an ornament to the college.

406
00:34:03,691 --> 00:34:05,482
- Splendid.
- Not at all.

407
00:34:05,567 --> 00:34:08,319
I was shocked when you
closed down the college

408
00:34:08,404 --> 00:34:11,274
without that most important
last lesson.

409
00:34:11,365 --> 00:34:14,485
I'm sorry, my dear. No refunds.
Look at your contract.

410
00:34:14,576 --> 00:34:17,910
But I must have the spell
that comes with the last lesson!

411
00:34:17,996 --> 00:34:20,203
The matter is closed.
I bid you good day.

412
00:34:20,290 --> 00:34:22,616
I have an appointment at my club.

413
00:34:22,710 --> 00:34:24,619
The matter is not closed!

414
00:34:24,712 --> 00:34:27,629
- Don't let him get away.
- Righto!

415
00:34:35,639 --> 00:34:37,964
Here we are.

416
00:34:38,058 --> 00:34:40,383
Will you get this child off my leg?

417
00:34:40,477 --> 00:34:43,051
Filigree, apogee, pedigree, perigee.

418
00:34:50,529 --> 00:34:53,102
Now I trust you'll behave
more like a gentleman.

419
00:34:53,866 --> 00:34:55,739
Look out!

420
00:34:56,785 --> 00:34:58,861
There goes another rabbit.

421
00:34:58,954 --> 00:35:00,532
What was all that about?

422
00:35:00,622 --> 00:35:03,576
I changed you into a rabbit
with one of your own spells.

423
00:35:04,376 --> 00:35:07,543
My spell? From my school?

424
00:35:07,629 --> 00:35:09,752
Not one of your best spells.

425
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:13,043
It doesn't last.
Some of your others are much better.

426
00:35:13,135 --> 00:35:16,171
But I don't understand. My spell?

427
00:35:16,263 --> 00:35:18,671
They were just nonsense words
from an old book.

428
00:35:18,766 --> 00:35:20,758
They worked perfectly well for me.

429
00:35:22,728 --> 00:35:25,397
They work for you?

430
00:35:28,192 --> 00:35:31,857
Good woman! Some kind of destiny
has brought us together.

431
00:35:31,945 --> 00:35:34,650
You got these spells
out of some old book, you say?

432
00:35:34,740 --> 00:35:37,065
I changed them round a bit.

433
00:35:37,159 --> 00:35:40,575
I gave them a bit
of my own style, as it were.

434
00:35:40,662 --> 00:35:43,996
The old sorcerers did have
a bit of a tendency to waffle on.

435
00:35:44,083 --> 00:35:48,294
But dear lady, I never thought
I'd meet somebody like you.

436
00:35:49,463 --> 00:35:51,254
What a treasure.

437
00:35:51,340 --> 00:35:54,625
Mr Browne, will you please
stick to the point.

438
00:35:54,718 --> 00:35:57,340
I would like to see this book
immediately.

439
00:35:57,429 --> 00:35:59,920
Certainly. It's at my new town house.

440
00:36:00,015 --> 00:36:02,506
Would you care
to join me for luncheon?

441
00:36:02,601 --> 00:36:05,602
We can discuss my ideas
at the same time.

442
00:36:06,271 --> 00:36:09,854
Thank you. We'd be delighted.
We shall all go together.

443
00:36:09,942 --> 00:36:14,105
- On the bed?
- On the bed, Paul. Come along.

444
00:36:16,782 --> 00:36:19,736
You go round the other side.
I always travel on the left.

445
00:36:21,787 --> 00:36:24,278
Will you give the address
to Paul, please?

446
00:36:24,373 --> 00:36:27,742
May I ask how we are going
to get there on this bed? Fly?

447
00:36:27,835 --> 00:36:30,539
My dear Professor,
with your own travelling spell.

448
00:36:30,629 --> 00:36:33,298
The one you gave with the course
as a bonus.

449
00:36:33,382 --> 00:36:36,667
My travelling spell?
That works as well?

450
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:38,967
Just give the address, please.

451
00:36:39,888 --> 00:36:42,095
8 Winchfield Road.

452
00:36:42,182 --> 00:36:45,847
Bed, take us to 8 Winchfield Road.

453
00:36:54,695 --> 00:36:57,150
Madam, is this vehicle safe?

454
00:36:57,239 --> 00:37:02,993
Perfectly. A bit theatrical, perhaps,
but then most good spells are.

455
00:37:39,031 --> 00:37:41,604
We're here.
I would never have believed it.

456
00:37:42,826 --> 00:37:46,030
You must have given us
the wrong address. Do you live here?

457
00:37:46,121 --> 00:37:48,826
In fact, I do.
Temporarily, at any rate.

458
00:37:48,916 --> 00:37:51,870
I found the front door open.
The house was deserted.

459
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:54,498
Everyone has left the neighbourhood.

460
00:37:54,588 --> 00:37:56,913
Why should they do that?

461
00:37:57,758 --> 00:38:00,794
This probably has
something to do with it.

462
00:38:02,513 --> 00:38:04,422
Merciful heavens!

463
00:38:04,515 --> 00:38:07,432
You should be terrified
at the very idea of living here.

464
00:38:07,518 --> 00:38:10,887
You would have thought so.
I am by nature a little bit of a coward.

465
00:38:10,979 --> 00:38:12,687
But then I pondered.

466
00:38:12,773 --> 00:38:16,474
In the perverse nature of things,
this diabolical object

467
00:38:16,568 --> 00:38:18,775
is probably the best friend
I've ever had.

468
00:38:18,862 --> 00:38:22,148
It enables me, for the first time
in my life, to live like a king.

469
00:38:22,241 --> 00:38:24,317
Shall we go in?

470
00:38:26,620 --> 00:38:30,071
Rothschild '26. Noble, worldly-wise,

471
00:38:30,165 --> 00:38:32,739
but with a charming
touch of innocence.

472
00:38:32,835 --> 00:38:35,041
Mr Browne, the book. Where is it?

473
00:38:35,129 --> 00:38:37,086
Dear lady, you are relentless.

474
00:38:37,172 --> 00:38:41,466
The book is in the library. We shall
proceed there after our cheese and wine.

475
00:38:42,344 --> 00:38:44,752
Why do you keep the curtains closed?

476
00:38:44,847 --> 00:38:48,050
So that we may enjoy
the gentle glow of candle light.

477
00:38:48,142 --> 00:38:51,974
More likely so's a copper don't peek in
and catch you hiding out here.

478
00:38:52,062 --> 00:38:54,732
Why don't you
have a look round the house?

479
00:38:54,815 --> 00:38:57,104
- I want to chat with Miss Price.
- May we?

480
00:38:57,192 --> 00:38:59,814
Yes, run along.
But don't touch anything.

481
00:38:59,903 --> 00:39:02,940
Remember, this house
does not belong to Mr Browne.

482
00:39:03,365 --> 00:39:05,607
Mr Browne, where is that book?

483
00:39:05,701 --> 00:39:08,536
I must have that spell
on substitutiary locomotion.

484
00:39:20,341 --> 00:39:23,674
- What is it? A toy shop?
- No, it's a nursery.

485
00:39:23,761 --> 00:39:27,889
- Ain't you ever seen a nursery?
- No. And neither have you.

486
00:40:05,386 --> 00:40:07,129
Would you hold this, please?

487
00:40:22,027 --> 00:40:24,483
What do you think of that?

488
00:40:30,327 --> 00:40:32,996
- Well, I... don't know what to think.
- Miss Price.

489
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:37,908
Think how successful I could be with
an assistant who can really do magic.

490
00:40:38,919 --> 00:40:43,961
Dear lady, have you ever considered
entering show business?

491
00:40:44,049 --> 00:40:46,125
- The what business?
- The theatre!

492
00:40:46,218 --> 00:40:48,507
Pantomimes, village fairs,
the seaside.

493
00:40:48,595 --> 00:40:51,466
Brighton, Blackpool,
follies on the prom.

494
00:40:51,557 --> 00:40:53,430
I have very important work to do.

495
00:40:53,517 --> 00:40:56,304
Listen to me. We could make a packet.

496
00:40:56,395 --> 00:40:58,553
Let us strike a bargain

497
00:40:58,647 --> 00:41:00,141
You possess a gift

498
00:41:00,232 --> 00:41:02,272
But I can speak the jargon

499
00:41:02,359 --> 00:41:04,981
That will give your gift
the needed lift

500
00:41:05,070 --> 00:41:07,193
You possess the know-how

501
00:41:07,281 --> 00:41:09,439
And I command the show-how

502
00:41:09,533 --> 00:41:13,531
Oh, how successful you could be

503
00:41:13,620 --> 00:41:15,494
With me

504
00:41:15,581 --> 00:41:17,953
I'm afraid we're wasting
valuable time.

505
00:41:18,042 --> 00:41:19,785
- What's your name?
- Miss Price.

506
00:41:19,877 --> 00:41:21,786
- Your first name.
- Eglantine.

507
00:41:23,547 --> 00:41:28,707
Eglantine, Eglantine,
oh, how you'll shine

508
00:41:28,802 --> 00:41:33,049
Your lot and my lot
have got to combine

509
00:41:33,140 --> 00:41:36,889
Eglantine, Eglantine,
hark to the stars

510
00:41:36,977 --> 00:41:40,476
Destiny calls us,
the future is ours

511
00:41:40,564 --> 00:41:44,431
As the shine sells the boot
and the blossoms the fruit

512
00:41:44,526 --> 00:41:48,441
All you need to succeed
in your plan

513
00:41:48,530 --> 00:41:52,777
Is the proper ally
upon whom to rely

514
00:41:52,868 --> 00:41:56,071
And I'm your man

515
00:41:56,580 --> 00:42:01,041
For I have an acumen
that's nigh-superhuman

516
00:42:01,126 --> 00:42:03,748
I sell things that nobody can

517
00:42:04,630 --> 00:42:08,841
So I humbly suggest
you accept my behest

518
00:42:08,926 --> 00:42:12,010
I'm your man

519
00:42:13,055 --> 00:42:16,554
Eglantine, Eglantine,
oh how you'll shine

520
00:42:16,642 --> 00:42:18,053
Will you stop?

521
00:42:18,143 --> 00:42:20,634
Your lot and my lot
have got to combine

522
00:42:20,729 --> 00:42:24,229
Eglantine, Eglantine,
hark to the stars

523
00:42:24,316 --> 00:42:27,519
Destiny calls us,
the future is ours

524
00:42:32,324 --> 00:42:34,400
What are you reading?

525
00:42:36,412 --> 00:42:38,120
"Isle of Naboombu."

526
00:42:38,205 --> 00:42:42,072
- Can't be no such place.
- There is too such a place.

527
00:42:42,167 --> 00:42:45,085
These pictures prove it, don't it?

528
00:42:46,213 --> 00:42:50,080
Bit weird, ain't it?
Animals wearing hats and things.

529
00:42:51,343 --> 00:42:53,170
I like it.

530
00:42:55,681 --> 00:42:58,717
Now where is the book?

531
00:42:58,809 --> 00:43:00,885
Well? Where is it?

532
00:43:18,162 --> 00:43:21,198
At last, Mr Browne!

533
00:43:25,127 --> 00:43:28,461
"The Spells of Astoroth."

534
00:43:28,547 --> 00:43:30,540
Of course.

535
00:43:30,632 --> 00:43:33,420
Here's the travelling spell.
This is where you got it.

536
00:43:35,429 --> 00:43:37,635
Does one's nose
have to twitch like this?

537
00:43:38,265 --> 00:43:40,305
Oh, you're back, Mr Browne.

538
00:43:40,392 --> 00:43:42,468
Miss Price,
a word about your tactics.

539
00:43:42,561 --> 00:43:44,969
I don't mind being changed
into a hawk or a tiger

540
00:43:45,064 --> 00:43:46,522
or something with dash.

541
00:43:46,607 --> 00:43:50,190
But always a fluffy white rabbit?
It's intolerable!

542
00:43:51,653 --> 00:43:55,402
Here we are!
Substitutiary locomotion.

543
00:43:56,116 --> 00:43:59,616
"The ancient art of..."

544
00:43:59,703 --> 00:44:05,409
"The spell which creates
this force is five mystic words."

545
00:44:05,501 --> 00:44:08,170
"These words are..."

546
00:44:13,550 --> 00:44:15,377
But the rest of the book is missing!

547
00:44:15,469 --> 00:44:17,877
Now you see why
I closed down the college.

548
00:44:19,682 --> 00:44:22,932
- But where are the other pages?
- Haven't the foggiest.

549
00:44:23,018 --> 00:44:25,936
- Listen to me!
- I'm all ears.

550
00:44:26,021 --> 00:44:29,604
You will be if you don't pay attention.
Where did you get this book?

551
00:44:29,692 --> 00:44:33,772
I bought it from a street market.
There was a bit of unpleasantness.

552
00:44:33,862 --> 00:44:36,650
He claimed that I'd given him
a dud coin. I ask you!

553
00:44:36,740 --> 00:44:39,196
There was a sort of scuffle.
The book tore.

554
00:44:39,284 --> 00:44:41,526
He got one half and I got the other.

555
00:44:41,620 --> 00:44:45,155
- But where's the other half now?
- It's probably been thrown away.

556
00:44:45,249 --> 00:44:48,166
But if it still exists,
there's only one place to find it.

557
00:44:48,836 --> 00:44:52,370
- Where is that?
- Portobello Road

558
00:44:52,464 --> 00:44:54,671
Portobello Road

559
00:44:54,758 --> 00:44:58,293
Street where
the riches of ages are stowed

560
00:44:58,387 --> 00:45:01,756
Anything and everything
a chap can unload

561
00:45:01,849 --> 00:45:05,099
Is sold off the barrow
in Portobello Road

562
00:45:05,185 --> 00:45:10,346
You'll find what you want
in the Portobello Road

563
00:45:12,651 --> 00:45:16,020
- Rare alabaster
- Genuine plaster

564
00:45:16,113 --> 00:45:19,446
A filigreed samovar
owned by the tsars

565
00:45:19,533 --> 00:45:22,949
- A pen used by Shelley
- A new Botticelli!

566
00:45:23,037 --> 00:45:26,821
The snippers that clipped
old King Edward's cigars

567
00:45:26,915 --> 00:45:30,498
Made in Hong Kong?
Two bob a dozen, would you say?

568
00:45:30,586 --> 00:45:33,752
- Waterford crystal
- Napoleon's pistols

569
00:45:33,839 --> 00:45:37,422
Society heirlooms with genuine gems

570
00:45:37,509 --> 00:45:41,174
Rembrandts, El Grecos,
Toulouse-Lautrecos

571
00:45:41,263 --> 00:45:44,762
Painted last week
on the banks of the Thames

572
00:45:45,726 --> 00:45:48,596
Very interesting,
but where do they sell books?

573
00:45:48,687 --> 00:45:50,894
There's a little place
around the corner.

574
00:45:51,690 --> 00:45:55,142
Portobello Road, Portobello Road

575
00:45:55,235 --> 00:45:58,651
Street where
the riches of ages are stowed

576
00:45:58,739 --> 00:46:01,942
Anything and everything
a chap can unload

577
00:46:02,034 --> 00:46:05,284
Is sold off the barrow
in Portobello Road

578
00:46:05,371 --> 00:46:10,198
You meet all your chums
in the Portobello Road

579
00:46:10,292 --> 00:46:12,332
Lovely to see you. Goodbye.

580
00:46:15,798 --> 00:46:18,467
What I want
is the other half of this book.

581
00:46:18,550 --> 00:46:20,590
All in good time, my dear.

582
00:46:20,678 --> 00:46:24,011
Burke's Peerage, The Bride Book,
The Fishmonger's Guidebook

583
00:46:24,098 --> 00:46:26,137
I'm looking for
the other part of this.

584
00:46:26,225 --> 00:46:29,142
A Victorian novel, "The Unwanted Son"

585
00:46:29,228 --> 00:46:32,098
- You don't understand!
- The History of Potting

586
00:46:32,189 --> 00:46:33,600
The Yearbook of Yachting

587
00:46:33,691 --> 00:46:37,439
The leather-bound
"Life of Attila the Hun"

588
00:46:37,528 --> 00:46:40,731
Portobello Road, Portobello Road

589
00:46:40,823 --> 00:46:44,405
Street where
the riches of ages are stowed

590
00:46:44,493 --> 00:46:47,827
Artefacts to glorify a regal abode

591
00:46:47,913 --> 00:46:51,329
Are hidden in the flotsam
in Portobello Road

592
00:46:51,417 --> 00:46:52,827
Who do you think you are?

593
00:46:52,918 --> 00:46:55,836
Tokens and treasures,
yesterday's pleasures

594
00:46:55,921 --> 00:46:59,255
Cheap imitations
and heirlooms of old

595
00:46:59,341 --> 00:47:02,959
Dented and tarnished,
scarred and unvarnished

596
00:47:03,053 --> 00:47:04,429
In old Portobello...

597
00:47:04,513 --> 00:47:07,218
This lady is looking
for the other half of this book.

598
00:47:07,307 --> 00:47:09,300
It's called "The Spells of Astoroth".

599
00:47:13,731 --> 00:47:16,222
I don't keep no torn
or damaged books here.

600
00:47:16,316 --> 00:47:19,732
What do you think I am?
A ruddy wastepaper merchant?

601
00:47:21,947 --> 00:47:26,027
You can eat like a king
in the Portobello Road

602
00:47:28,037 --> 00:47:30,824
There's another bookstore
along here somewhere.

603
00:47:30,914 --> 00:47:33,785
You don't expect
to sell a piano like that, do you?

604
00:47:33,876 --> 00:47:36,283
Let me have a go, my dear fellow.

605
00:47:37,713 --> 00:47:41,960
Portobello Road, Portobello Road

606
00:47:42,051 --> 00:47:45,217
Happy things are happening
in Portobello Road

607
00:47:45,304 --> 00:47:49,467
You feel like a ballerina
when you're hopping like a toad

608
00:47:49,558 --> 00:47:53,141
When you kick your heels up
down in Portobello Road

609
00:50:26,715 --> 00:50:28,174
Come on, ducks!

610
00:50:29,718 --> 00:50:31,378
Come on, girls!

611
00:50:42,481 --> 00:50:44,474
Lovely.

612
00:50:51,740 --> 00:50:54,065
Oh, yeah, play the drums.

613
00:52:43,686 --> 00:52:45,346
Closing time!

614
00:52:51,944 --> 00:52:53,853
Bye!

615
00:53:07,001 --> 00:53:10,583
Portobello Road

616
00:53:11,505 --> 00:53:14,459
Portobello Road

617
00:53:14,550 --> 00:53:21,431
Street where the riches
of ages are stowed

618
00:53:21,515 --> 00:53:26,640
Anything and everything
a chap can unload...

619
00:53:26,729 --> 00:53:30,311
Hey, governor. Something
for the lady friend? Nylons?

620
00:53:30,399 --> 00:53:32,308
- No, thank you.
- Petrol coupons?

621
00:53:32,401 --> 00:53:34,358
- Chocs for the little 'uns?
- No.

622
00:53:34,445 --> 00:53:37,399
How about one of these, mate?
Fell off the back of a lorry.

623
00:53:37,489 --> 00:53:40,989
- Be a good chap and run away.
- Would you fancy this, then?

624
00:53:42,703 --> 00:53:45,490
Now you have my undivided attention.

625
00:53:45,581 --> 00:53:48,784
- What can I do for you?
- Get over to the Bookman right away.

626
00:53:48,876 --> 00:53:51,545
He wants to see you. You too.

627
00:53:52,379 --> 00:53:55,713
Who is the Bookman? And what right
has he got to order me about?

628
00:53:55,799 --> 00:53:58,421
I think we'd better
ask questions later.

629
00:53:58,510 --> 00:54:00,218
Excuse me.

630
00:54:04,516 --> 00:54:07,850
Sorry, guv.
No one told me about the stairs.

631
00:54:07,936 --> 00:54:10,427
Why didn't you
bring Scotland Yard, Swinburne,

632
00:54:10,522 --> 00:54:12,598
and half the Household Cavalry
as well?

633
00:54:12,691 --> 00:54:14,684
What's the bed for?

634
00:54:14,777 --> 00:54:17,943
It's a present for you.
That's what he said.

635
00:54:18,030 --> 00:54:20,521
Nothing of the sort.
The bed belongs to me.

636
00:54:20,616 --> 00:54:22,739
Except for this knob, which is mine.

637
00:54:22,826 --> 00:54:26,824
Bookman, there's been bad blood
between us long enough.

638
00:54:26,914 --> 00:54:30,164
Let this gift begin friendship anew.

639
00:54:30,250 --> 00:54:33,702
- Draw the curtains. Lock the door.
- You'll be snug as a bug.

640
00:54:33,796 --> 00:54:37,212
Isn't that the section of the manuscript
we've been looking for?

641
00:54:37,299 --> 00:54:40,502
- Who is this person?
- Miss Eglantine Price.

642
00:54:40,594 --> 00:54:42,836
A charming young woman
of my acquaintance.

643
00:54:42,930 --> 00:54:46,180
Miss Price, I've been looking
for this other bit a long time.

644
00:54:46,266 --> 00:54:49,635
Mr Swinburne told me you were
in the market making enquiries.

645
00:54:49,728 --> 00:54:54,604
And here we are. I don't mind saying,
to see it all together at last...

646
00:54:54,692 --> 00:54:58,606
- There isn't much I wouldn't do.
- Or haven't done, for that matter.

647
00:54:58,696 --> 00:55:02,776
- Right, guv?
- You'll close your mouth, Swinburne.

648
00:55:02,866 --> 00:55:05,274
Is that clear?

649
00:55:05,369 --> 00:55:10,327
It's all like a jolly detective story
or jigsaw puzzle, isn't it?

650
00:55:10,416 --> 00:55:13,701
We're both after the same spell.

651
00:55:13,794 --> 00:55:16,748
You have one clue, I have the other.

652
00:55:17,297 --> 00:55:23,134
Yes, in that case, the sensible thing
seems to be for us to cooperate.

653
00:55:23,971 --> 00:55:27,340
I assume you're looking
for the same thing I am.

654
00:55:27,433 --> 00:55:28,761
May I?

655
00:55:30,561 --> 00:55:33,645
This is quite a moment
for both of us.

656
00:55:35,899 --> 00:55:38,355
"Substitutiary locomotion,

657
00:55:38,444 --> 00:55:42,691
the lost miracle of the ancients."
And so on and so forth.

658
00:55:42,781 --> 00:55:44,192
Here we are.

659
00:55:44,283 --> 00:55:48,696
"The spell which creates this force
is five mystic words."

660
00:55:48,787 --> 00:55:50,579
"These words are...

661
00:55:50,664 --> 00:55:56,667
engraved on the star that was always
worn by the sorcerer Astoroth."

662
00:55:56,754 --> 00:55:59,126
But where are the words of the spell?

663
00:55:59,214 --> 00:56:02,334
I assumed they'd be
in your half of the manuscript.

664
00:56:02,426 --> 00:56:05,178
I thought they'd be in yours!

665
00:56:05,262 --> 00:56:08,761
Once again, a dead end.

666
00:56:10,017 --> 00:56:12,259
I shall never know the secret.

667
00:56:14,229 --> 00:56:18,393
Isn't that old Astoroth?
And there's his star.

668
00:56:18,484 --> 00:56:20,891
Pity it's so small
you can't read the writing.

669
00:56:20,986 --> 00:56:23,987
- But why the animals?
- Towards the end of his life,

670
00:56:24,073 --> 00:56:26,149
Astoroth kept animals in cages

671
00:56:26,241 --> 00:56:29,527
in search for the spells that
would make them more like humans.

672
00:56:29,620 --> 00:56:34,080
The legend is that finally the
animals rebelled at the experiment,

673
00:56:34,166 --> 00:56:38,294
killed Astoroth
and stole many of his powers.

674
00:56:38,379 --> 00:56:41,048
Including the star
with the spell on it.

675
00:56:41,131 --> 00:56:44,631
Possibly.
They found a ship, sailed away

676
00:56:44,718 --> 00:56:46,794
and were never heard of again.

677
00:56:46,887 --> 00:56:50,754
However, there is a final notation
in my half of the book

678
00:56:50,849 --> 00:56:53,257
saying that in the 17th century

679
00:56:53,352 --> 00:56:56,388
a shipwrecked lascar
was taken from the sea

680
00:56:56,480 --> 00:57:00,264
half mad with thirst
and exposure to the sun.

681
00:57:00,359 --> 00:57:05,946
Before he died, he swore he had seen
an island ruled by animals.

682
00:57:06,031 --> 00:57:07,312
Where?

683
00:57:07,408 --> 00:57:12,485
There is,
I regret to say, no such island.

684
00:57:12,579 --> 00:57:14,952
I looked for it in every chart.

685
00:57:15,040 --> 00:57:18,658
The Isle of Naboombu does not exist.

686
00:57:18,752 --> 00:57:21,457
It does too! Got my own...

687
00:57:22,548 --> 00:57:24,955
- What is he trying to say?
- Nothing!

688
00:57:25,050 --> 00:57:28,004
When he don't say nothing,
he mumbles.

689
00:57:28,095 --> 00:57:30,716
I wish the child to speak!

690
00:57:31,807 --> 00:57:35,721
- Now you've done it.
- There is too such a place.

691
00:57:36,854 --> 00:57:41,017
Got my own book. There.
Real pretty letters, ain't it?

692
00:57:42,776 --> 00:57:45,611
- Let me see it.
- You're not interested, Bookman.

693
00:57:45,696 --> 00:57:48,650
- It's just a children's book.
- I'll be the judge of that.

694
00:57:48,741 --> 00:57:50,235
- Give it to me.
- No.

695
00:57:50,325 --> 00:57:53,576
Please don't annoy me.

696
00:57:53,662 --> 00:57:56,996
- Give me the book, boy.
- Not likely.

697
00:57:58,083 --> 00:58:00,870
Bit of a stalemate, isn't it?

698
00:58:05,132 --> 00:58:07,705
If it's all the same to you,
I'd rather use my own.

699
00:58:07,801 --> 00:58:10,553
Sentiment, you know.

700
00:58:10,637 --> 00:58:12,714
Come along, Paul. It's time to go.

701
00:58:12,806 --> 00:58:16,851
Go? How, my dear? The door is locked.

702
00:58:16,935 --> 00:58:20,221
Observe the fundamental weakness
of the criminal mind.

703
00:58:20,314 --> 00:58:23,481
- You will believe no one or anything.
- I understand.

704
00:58:23,567 --> 00:58:26,402
- The knob, Paul.
- Course you do, my dear.

705
00:58:26,487 --> 00:58:29,938
We can tell them the complete truth.
They will believe nothing.

706
00:58:30,741 --> 00:58:32,947
He's up to something, you know.

707
00:58:33,035 --> 00:58:37,578
Before your very eyes, I shall cause
this bed and the occupants on it

708
00:58:37,664 --> 00:58:39,741
to disappear.

709
00:58:39,833 --> 00:58:43,582
I should like to see a cheap-jack
tenth-rate entertainer

710
00:58:43,671 --> 00:58:45,544
do a trick like that.

711
00:58:45,631 --> 00:58:47,291
"Cheap-jack entertainer."

712
00:58:47,383 --> 00:58:49,874
- That was naughty.
- All right, Paul.

713
00:58:50,719 --> 00:58:52,628
- Where to?
- To the Island of Naboombu.

714
00:58:52,721 --> 00:58:56,055
- I'm very curious about that place.
- Good.

715
00:58:56,141 --> 00:58:58,811
Bed, take us
to the Island of Naboombu.

716
00:59:04,525 --> 00:59:07,098
Enough of this nonsense!
Get the book!

717
00:59:44,148 --> 00:59:46,721
Beastly climate.
I never did fancy the sea.

718
00:59:47,151 --> 00:59:50,354
- Where are we?
- Naboombu, of course.

719
00:59:50,446 --> 00:59:53,281
I've never seen
no island like this before.

720
00:59:53,365 --> 00:59:56,615
I'm afraid we may have
fallen into the lagoon.

721
00:59:56,702 --> 01:00:00,153
That's right.
Here we are on page three.

722
01:00:06,712 --> 01:00:09,713
Oi, Mr Codfish!

723
01:00:09,798 --> 01:00:14,341
Hello, young fellow!
Welcome to Naboombu Lagoon.

724
01:00:15,095 --> 01:00:18,429
Now I'm hearing things.
Fish don't talk.

725
01:00:19,058 --> 01:00:21,097
Not too bright, is he?

726
01:00:21,185 --> 01:00:24,933
- He's my brother.
- Oh? Sorry.

727
01:00:25,647 --> 01:00:28,317
Mr Codfish,
where is the Island of Naboombu?

728
01:00:28,400 --> 01:00:31,603
You mean the land part? Oh, that.

729
01:00:31,695 --> 01:00:34,566
Straight up. You can't miss it.

730
01:00:34,656 --> 01:00:36,982
None of my business, of course,

731
01:00:37,076 --> 01:00:40,527
but I shouldn't go there
if I were you.

732
01:00:40,621 --> 01:00:44,535
- Having troubles, they are.
- Troubles?

733
01:00:44,625 --> 01:00:47,791
He's right, you know.
A lot of trouble.

734
01:00:47,878 --> 01:00:50,451
Trouble or not,
we should be getting along.

735
01:00:50,547 --> 01:00:53,335
- I wish to see who is in charge.
- What's the rush?

736
01:00:53,425 --> 01:00:56,628
It's really rather splendid
down here. For you, my dear.

737
01:00:57,846 --> 01:00:59,305
Thank you.

738
01:01:06,105 --> 01:01:08,097
How pleasant...

739
01:01:08,190 --> 01:01:09,684
Bobbing along

740
01:01:09,775 --> 01:01:16,109
Bobbing along on the bottom
of the beautiful briny sea

741
01:01:16,824 --> 01:01:20,738
What a chance to get a better peep

742
01:01:20,828 --> 01:01:24,777
At the plants and creatures
of the deep

743
01:01:24,873 --> 01:01:28,123
We glide

744
01:01:28,210 --> 01:01:32,504
Far below the rolling tide

745
01:01:33,298 --> 01:01:36,632
Serene

746
01:01:36,719 --> 01:01:41,297
Through the bubbly blue and green

747
01:01:41,390 --> 01:01:43,928
It's lovely bobbing along

748
01:01:44,560 --> 01:01:50,515
Bobbing along on the bottom
of the beautiful briny sea

749
01:01:51,567 --> 01:01:55,861
What if the octopus,
the flounder and the cod

750
01:01:55,946 --> 01:01:57,440
Think we're rather odd?

751
01:01:57,531 --> 01:02:00,069
It's fun to promenade

752
01:02:00,159 --> 01:02:02,614
Bobbing along, singing a song

753
01:02:02,703 --> 01:02:08,409
On the bottom
of the beautiful briny sea

754
01:02:08,500 --> 01:02:09,698
Look!

755
01:03:44,930 --> 01:03:47,765
It's lovely bobbing along

756
01:03:47,850 --> 01:03:54,932
Bobbing along on the bottom
of the beautiful briny sea

757
01:03:55,024 --> 01:03:59,187
What a chance to get a better peep

758
01:03:59,278 --> 01:04:03,358
At the plants
and creatures of the deep

759
01:04:03,449 --> 01:04:06,153
It's grand

760
01:04:06,243 --> 01:04:10,455
When you're dancing on the sand

761
01:04:11,915 --> 01:04:14,916
Each glance

762
01:04:15,002 --> 01:04:19,213
Bubbles over with romance

763
01:04:19,298 --> 01:04:22,334
It's lovely bobbing along

764
01:04:22,426 --> 01:04:24,964
Bobbing along through the water

765
01:04:25,054 --> 01:04:28,802
Where we get along swimmingly

766
01:04:29,767 --> 01:04:34,227
Far from the frenzy
of the frantic world above

767
01:04:34,313 --> 01:04:38,311
- Two beneath the blue
- Could even fall in love

768
01:04:38,400 --> 01:04:40,642
Bobbing along, singing a song

769
01:04:40,736 --> 01:04:46,027
On the bottom
of the beautiful briny sea

770
01:04:47,201 --> 01:04:49,692
Bobbing along, singing a song

771
01:04:49,787 --> 01:04:55,659
On the bottom of the beautiful briny,
shimmery shiny

772
01:04:55,751 --> 01:04:59,499
Beautiful briny sea

773
01:05:01,507 --> 01:05:03,962
Bravo!

774
01:05:04,051 --> 01:05:07,467
Most exciting, most exciting.

775
01:05:08,847 --> 01:05:11,089
You've won the ruddy cup.

776
01:05:33,914 --> 01:05:36,405
Help!

777
01:05:48,846 --> 01:05:52,131
This time I really caught a whopper!

778
01:06:00,816 --> 01:06:05,145
People! Oh, no!

779
01:06:05,237 --> 01:06:07,111
What scurvy luck.

780
01:06:07,197 --> 01:06:09,985
- My goodness!
- I'll deal with this, my dear.

781
01:06:10,075 --> 01:06:12,993
- Don't you know that...
- Good day, captain.

782
01:06:13,078 --> 01:06:15,534
I used to be a bit
of a seafaring man myself.

783
01:06:15,622 --> 01:06:18,113
Many's the time
I've shipped out of Portsmouth.

784
01:06:18,208 --> 01:06:20,746
Delighted to meet a fellow mariner.

785
01:06:22,379 --> 01:06:24,253
Now stow it, mate.

786
01:06:24,340 --> 01:06:28,289
- Oh, really!
- Can't you read reading?

787
01:06:29,678 --> 01:06:34,470
It says... "No peopling allowed."

788
01:06:36,393 --> 01:06:39,430
- Ridiculous!
- Don't antagonise him, Mr Browne.

789
01:06:39,521 --> 01:06:44,563
That means I've got to throw you
all back. That's what to do.

790
01:06:44,651 --> 01:06:49,064
Wait it minute! It says here
that anybody can see the king.

791
01:06:49,156 --> 01:06:52,607
- And that's the law.
- Where do it say that?

792
01:06:52,701 --> 01:06:54,658
Here in my book.

793
01:06:55,996 --> 01:06:58,072
So it do.

794
01:07:00,376 --> 01:07:02,867
But if you people knew
what was good for you,

795
01:07:02,961 --> 01:07:06,544
you'd get yourselves
all throwed back.

796
01:07:06,632 --> 01:07:09,502
The king don't like people!

797
01:07:09,843 --> 01:07:14,173
Nonetheless, we must see the king
on an urgent personal matter.

798
01:07:14,264 --> 01:07:16,056
Please lead the way.

799
01:07:17,434 --> 01:07:21,302
But just don't say
I didn't warn you. See?

800
01:07:22,606 --> 01:07:24,765
Follow me.

801
01:07:48,465 --> 01:07:50,956
Get out of here!

802
01:07:58,559 --> 01:08:02,936
Yes. What can I do for you?

803
01:08:03,022 --> 01:08:06,437
I caught some people
down at the sea lagoon.

804
01:08:06,525 --> 01:08:09,016
They want to see the king.

805
01:08:09,111 --> 01:08:14,615
Really? Well, we can't be bothered
with that sort of thing now, can we?

806
01:08:17,286 --> 01:08:19,077
I don't know that I fancy this.

807
01:08:19,913 --> 01:08:22,998
His Majesty is in a frightful rage.

808
01:08:23,959 --> 01:08:26,628
Excuse me, sir.
As an all-round entertainer,

809
01:08:26,712 --> 01:08:30,330
I am considered not without talent.
Perhaps I can cheer him up.

810
01:08:30,424 --> 01:08:34,671
No, no. You don't understand.

811
01:08:34,762 --> 01:08:36,754
As everyone knows,

812
01:08:36,847 --> 01:08:41,723
His Majesty is
the world's greatest soccer player.

813
01:08:46,648 --> 01:08:49,186
But due to a technical problem,

814
01:08:49,276 --> 01:08:52,692
the Royal Cup match
cannot take place today.

815
01:08:52,780 --> 01:08:56,612
And His Majesty
had so set his heart on it!

816
01:08:56,700 --> 01:09:02,157
Throw these... creatures
back into the sea.

817
01:09:02,790 --> 01:09:04,829
Aye, aye, sir.

818
01:09:04,917 --> 01:09:07,372
Just a moment! I can help!

819
01:09:07,461 --> 01:09:11,126
Do you really think so?
I'd be most grateful.

820
01:09:11,215 --> 01:09:13,920
Do you know soccer?

821
01:09:14,009 --> 01:09:16,216
Do I know anything about soccer?

822
01:09:16,303 --> 01:09:19,387
Why, I was captain of Tottenham
Hotspurs for two years.

823
01:09:19,473 --> 01:09:21,715
Three seasons
with Manchester United...

824
01:09:21,809 --> 01:09:23,682
Yes, yes. You'll do.

825
01:09:23,769 --> 01:09:26,342
Come this way, please.

826
01:09:26,772 --> 01:09:29,975
Mr Browne,
are you certain you'll be all right?

827
01:09:35,280 --> 01:09:37,439
Now what?

828
01:09:37,533 --> 01:09:39,775
Not an ideal person
in many respects,

829
01:09:39,868 --> 01:09:42,953
but Mr Browne is a very brave man.

830
01:09:47,835 --> 01:09:49,377
Do you think he's done for?

831
01:09:55,092 --> 01:09:57,381
Do you think so?

832
01:10:01,724 --> 01:10:06,386
I can't tell you how
I appreciate this.

833
01:10:06,478 --> 01:10:10,227
For some reason
we have great difficulty

834
01:10:10,315 --> 01:10:14,444
finding referees round here.

835
01:10:14,528 --> 01:10:17,814
If there be one thing we like,

836
01:10:17,906 --> 01:10:22,403
it's volunteers, eh, Birdy?

837
01:10:25,581 --> 01:10:27,869
He's a proper king!
Look at his crown!

838
01:10:27,958 --> 01:10:30,710
What's he got round his neck?

839
01:10:31,545 --> 01:10:35,044
What a magnificent... ornament, sire.

840
01:10:35,132 --> 01:10:38,133
Ah, yes.

841
01:10:38,218 --> 01:10:42,216
Wouldn't be without it.
Been in the family for years.

842
01:10:42,306 --> 01:10:45,011
The Star of Astoroth!

843
01:10:47,394 --> 01:10:51,012
You're to sit
in His Majesty's royal box.

844
01:10:51,106 --> 01:10:54,807
No littering, no chewing, no fruit
or wrappers or sweets. Please.

845
01:11:05,204 --> 01:11:07,742
Rise, please.

846
01:11:09,666 --> 01:11:11,908
Loyal fans,

847
01:11:12,002 --> 01:11:15,252
this is official.

848
01:11:15,339 --> 01:11:20,760
We have a volunteer referee.

849
01:11:33,691 --> 01:11:37,356
Let the match begin!

850
01:11:39,738 --> 01:11:42,027
He's still wearing it!

851
01:11:42,116 --> 01:11:44,737
Right, Dirty Yellows,
let's have a clean game.

852
01:11:47,913 --> 01:11:50,202
Right, True Blues, best foot forward.

853
01:12:27,119 --> 01:12:29,325
Weird sort of game they play here.

854
01:13:09,828 --> 01:13:12,284
Hurry up! Get rid of it!

855
01:13:34,436 --> 01:13:35,895
Gracious!

856
01:13:36,939 --> 01:13:40,639
You're doing fine, matey.

857
01:13:44,947 --> 01:13:48,398
Move it around.

858
01:13:50,160 --> 01:13:52,034
Get on with the match!

859
01:14:09,430 --> 01:14:11,221
- Foul!
- They're only animals.

860
01:14:11,306 --> 01:14:13,976
That's no excuse for dirty football.

861
01:14:42,838 --> 01:14:44,961
Ref, are you blind?

862
01:14:45,049 --> 01:14:48,334
Be quiet, Charles!
Don't forget who the referee is!

863
01:15:08,864 --> 01:15:11,699
- Don't they have no rules?
- Course they do.

864
01:15:11,784 --> 01:15:13,776
The king makes them up
as he goes along.

865
01:15:58,080 --> 01:16:01,081
Poor Mr Browne.
Do you think he's all right?

866
01:16:02,251 --> 01:16:04,124
Well, he's moving.

867
01:16:04,712 --> 01:16:07,748
Steady, matey. Move it around.

868
01:16:15,556 --> 01:16:17,881
He almost had it then.

869
01:16:36,535 --> 01:16:39,240
Looks like he's done for this time.

870
01:16:58,140 --> 01:17:02,351
Don't just stand there! Head it in!

871
01:17:39,973 --> 01:17:45,348
Stop... that... ball!

872
01:18:20,639 --> 01:18:22,596
Goal!

873
01:18:23,976 --> 01:18:26,977
Game's over. I win.

874
01:18:32,943 --> 01:18:35,564
Let me give you a hand, matey.

875
01:18:35,654 --> 01:18:38,691
That's quite all right, Your Majesty.
Thank you so much.

876
01:18:38,782 --> 01:18:41,700
Please, let me help you
on with your robe.

877
01:18:41,785 --> 01:18:44,241
Why, yes. Thank you.

878
01:18:44,329 --> 01:18:46,951
Can't have you
catching cold, sire, can we?

879
01:18:47,041 --> 01:18:48,701
Why, no.

880
01:18:48,792 --> 01:18:51,829
Have you ever heard of something
called the gypsy switch?

881
01:18:51,920 --> 01:18:54,127
No, can't say that I have.

882
01:18:54,214 --> 01:18:56,290
Remind me to
tell you about it some time.

883
01:18:56,383 --> 01:18:58,839
I can't tell you when
we've had such a good time.

884
01:18:58,927 --> 01:19:02,593
We'll carry your memory
in our hearts for a long while.

885
01:19:02,681 --> 01:19:04,970
I think it's time to leave.

886
01:19:06,226 --> 01:19:07,970
Must you go?

887
01:19:08,062 --> 01:19:10,303
Must be dashing. Marvellous game.

888
01:19:10,397 --> 01:19:12,306
Lovely to see you. Goodbye.

889
01:19:16,111 --> 01:19:18,781
Friendly lot.

890
01:19:18,864 --> 01:19:24,203
Don't mind them visiting.
Wouldn't want them living here.

891
01:19:26,830 --> 01:19:29,701
- Come along, children.
- Hurry up.

892
01:19:35,631 --> 01:19:39,581
Stop gibbering!
What's the matter with you?

893
01:19:40,010 --> 01:19:42,382
Your Royal Star!

894
01:19:42,471 --> 01:19:45,507
They've stolen your Royal Star!

895
01:19:47,810 --> 01:19:50,051
Don't be ridiculous.

896
01:19:50,145 --> 01:19:52,352
What do you think this is?

897
01:19:59,738 --> 01:20:06,275
Why didn't you say so?

898
01:20:07,037 --> 01:20:09,789
Paul, put the knob on the bed.

899
01:20:12,001 --> 01:20:17,920
At last the magic words.
Treguna mekoides trecorum satis dee.

900
01:20:18,007 --> 01:20:20,414
I'll keep it.
Women always lose things.

901
01:20:25,514 --> 01:20:27,839
- Hurry, Paul! The knob!
- It's stuck!

902
01:20:30,436 --> 01:20:33,769
- I suppose I'd better do something.
- Please do. Quick.

903
01:20:35,691 --> 01:20:37,767
Got it.

904
01:20:40,529 --> 01:20:42,605
Filigree, apogee, pedigree...

905
01:20:46,827 --> 01:20:50,362
Oh, bother. I do hate shoddy work.

906
01:21:16,690 --> 01:21:19,228
I shall never get used to this thing.

907
01:21:19,318 --> 01:21:22,105
Will you push the bed
back into place, please?

908
01:21:22,196 --> 01:21:24,865
I think we could all
do with a nice cup of tea.

909
01:21:24,948 --> 01:21:27,819
No time. I've gone to a lot
of trouble to find this spell.

910
01:21:27,910 --> 01:21:30,365
I'm going to try it immediately.

911
01:21:31,288 --> 01:21:34,787
Mr Browne, kindly let me
have your shoes, please.

912
01:21:36,043 --> 01:21:38,664
- Fine.
- What's the shoes for?

913
01:21:38,754 --> 01:21:41,921
If you'd been paying attention
I should think you'd be aware

914
01:21:42,007 --> 01:21:46,254
that substitutiary locomotion is the art
of causing inanimate objects

915
01:21:46,345 --> 01:21:49,548
to take on a life force of their own.

916
01:21:49,640 --> 01:21:52,594
I must have inanimate objects
to experiment with.

917
01:21:52,685 --> 01:21:54,476
Makes sense, don't it?

918
01:21:55,396 --> 01:21:58,729
Stand back, everyone.
I need plenty of room.

919
01:22:03,529 --> 01:22:06,565
I want you all
to be absolutely quiet.

920
01:22:07,449 --> 01:22:10,450
Mr Browne, you have
the Star of Astoroth, I believe.

921
01:22:10,536 --> 01:22:12,943
Oh, yes. It's in my nice clean hanky.

922
01:22:20,087 --> 01:22:21,830
It's all right, Mr Browne.

923
01:22:21,922 --> 01:22:24,591
I should have realised
that it would be impossible

924
01:22:24,675 --> 01:22:27,082
to take an object
from one world into another.

925
01:22:31,807 --> 01:22:35,757
If only I would have had the sense
to remember the words on that star.

926
01:22:35,853 --> 01:22:40,230
- I know the words.
- Don't bother her. She's thinking.

927
01:22:40,315 --> 01:22:43,186
Why don't you and I nip out
and get something for supper?

928
01:22:43,277 --> 01:22:46,610
And I might conceivably
call into the pub for a pint

929
01:22:46,697 --> 01:22:48,820
to steady my nerves.

930
01:22:50,200 --> 01:22:53,118
I do know the words, Miss Price.

931
01:22:53,203 --> 01:22:56,288
How can you know the words
when Miss Price doesn't?

932
01:22:58,667 --> 01:23:02,795
Troop movements and massing
of barges in French and Dutch ports.

933
01:23:02,880 --> 01:23:05,122
The prime minister
has told the nation

934
01:23:05,215 --> 01:23:08,086
to be on the alert for signs
of a possible invasion.

935
01:23:08,177 --> 01:23:10,004
That was the news.

936
01:23:10,095 --> 01:23:12,717
I might have been able
to do something about this.

937
01:23:12,806 --> 01:23:14,680
It's out of your hands now, my dear.

938
01:23:14,767 --> 01:23:17,684
If only I could have remembered
those words. It's maddening.

939
01:23:18,187 --> 01:23:20,393
Why don't someone ask me?

940
01:23:20,481 --> 01:23:25,190
Come off it, Paul. You can't remember
those kind of words.

941
01:23:25,277 --> 01:23:31,232
You mean like "Treguna mekoides
trecorum satis dee"?

942
01:23:35,204 --> 01:23:37,410
- How do you know that?
- Easy.

943
01:23:37,498 --> 01:23:40,036
Says so right here in my book.

944
01:23:43,671 --> 01:23:47,170
You mean it was there
in your book all the time?

945
01:23:47,257 --> 01:23:49,583
Yeah. But nobody ever listens to me.

946
01:23:51,095 --> 01:23:54,096
Treguna mekoides

947
01:23:54,807 --> 01:23:57,677
trecorum satis dee.

948
01:23:59,436 --> 01:24:01,429
Nothing happened!

949
01:24:03,565 --> 01:24:05,273
Am I doing something wrong?

950
01:24:05,359 --> 01:24:07,766
Well, it does seem
a bit old-fashioned.

951
01:24:07,861 --> 01:24:10,483
After all, we are
in the 20th century.

952
01:24:11,615 --> 01:24:14,236
- What do you suggest?
- It needs rhythm. Tempo.

953
01:24:14,326 --> 01:24:17,327
Music.
As I always say, do it with a flair.

954
01:24:17,413 --> 01:24:19,904
- Do you mind if I have a go?
- Of course not.

955
01:24:19,998 --> 01:24:23,948
Come along, you lot!
We need all the help we can get.

956
01:24:24,044 --> 01:24:28,457
Treguna mekoides trecorum satis dee.

957
01:24:32,678 --> 01:24:36,426
Substitutiary locomotion

958
01:24:36,515 --> 01:24:41,058
Mystic power that's far
beyond the wildest notion

959
01:24:41,145 --> 01:24:45,937
It's so weird, so feared,
yet wonderful to see

960
01:24:46,025 --> 01:24:49,809
Substitutiary locomotion come to me

961
01:24:51,655 --> 01:24:53,030
Now!

962
01:24:55,409 --> 01:24:59,703
Treguna mekoides

963
01:24:59,788 --> 01:25:03,157
trecorum satis dee.

964
01:25:13,427 --> 01:25:18,089
I don't want locomotiary substitution

965
01:25:18,182 --> 01:25:22,226
Or remote intransecory convolution

966
01:25:22,311 --> 01:25:26,640
Only one precise solution is the key

967
01:25:26,732 --> 01:25:30,730
Substitutiary locomotion it must be

968
01:25:57,221 --> 01:26:01,265
Substitutiary locomotion

969
01:26:01,350 --> 01:26:05,644
Lovely substitutiary locomotion

970
01:26:05,729 --> 01:26:09,941
You've made substitutiary history

971
01:26:10,025 --> 01:26:14,355
With treguna mekoides
and a little help from me

972
01:26:14,446 --> 01:26:18,942
- With treguna mekoides and...
- Trecorum satis dee

973
01:26:33,924 --> 01:26:36,593
Mr Browne, what is going on here?

974
01:26:36,677 --> 01:26:38,966
I haven't the foggiest.

975
01:26:39,054 --> 01:26:41,426
How do you do?

976
01:26:41,515 --> 01:26:42,795
Shall we?

977
01:26:42,891 --> 01:26:45,679
- That's my nightgown!
- Is it really, my dear?

978
01:26:45,769 --> 01:26:47,976
I'm not responsible
for its behaviour.

979
01:26:48,063 --> 01:26:50,388
Obviously not, my dear.

980
01:26:52,359 --> 01:26:54,850
Paul, what on earth are you doing?

981
01:26:54,945 --> 01:26:57,436
Having a jolly good time,
that's what.

982
01:26:58,115 --> 01:27:01,116
- How can we stop all this?
- Must we? It's most agreeable.

983
01:27:01,201 --> 01:27:02,530
But we must do something.

984
01:27:02,619 --> 01:27:05,110
Didn't I give you
my all-purpose cut-off spell?

985
01:27:05,205 --> 01:27:06,997
- Lesson number eight.
- Eight.

986
01:27:07,082 --> 01:27:10,368
- Yes, number eight I think it was.
- Oi! My Sunday trousers!

987
01:27:15,299 --> 01:27:18,169
Buzz off, old chap.
Find your own dancing partner.

988
01:27:31,774 --> 01:27:33,897
Be careful, Carrie! Slow down!

989
01:27:41,033 --> 01:27:43,820
Mr Browne, will you please
control your shoes?

990
01:27:43,911 --> 01:27:47,446
Dear lady, I very much fear
that we have nothing under control.

991
01:28:07,893 --> 01:28:09,933
Do you mind?

992
01:28:27,371 --> 01:28:30,822
Now, who would like some more
of my lovely sausages and mash?

993
01:28:30,916 --> 01:28:33,372
- No more for me, thank you.
- Carrie?

994
01:28:33,460 --> 01:28:35,916
I've already had two helpings.

995
01:28:36,005 --> 01:28:38,211
- I'm full.
- Me, too.

996
01:28:39,842 --> 01:28:42,214
At least somebody wants some.

997
01:28:46,724 --> 01:28:50,971
Cheer up, my dear. This should
be something of a celebration.

998
01:28:51,061 --> 01:28:54,810
I'm sorry, but there doesn't
seem to be much to celebrate.

999
01:28:54,898 --> 01:28:58,943
- I still haven't mastered that spell.
- Of course you have.

1000
01:28:59,028 --> 01:29:02,278
You just need a little more practice.

1001
01:29:02,364 --> 01:29:04,689
- Do you really think so?
- No doubt about it.

1002
01:29:04,783 --> 01:29:07,321
Meantime, there's nothing
to liven the spirits

1003
01:29:07,411 --> 01:29:09,949
like a little master juggling.
Right, Charlie?

1004
01:29:10,039 --> 01:29:12,576
Go on then, guv!
Give us some juggling!

1005
01:29:19,798 --> 01:29:24,128
Very few better than me at this.
All you need is 20 years' practice

1006
01:29:24,219 --> 01:29:26,841
and a touch of genius.

1007
01:29:36,732 --> 01:29:38,974
Never happened to me before.

1008
01:29:39,068 --> 01:29:42,602
I don't usually juggle
with cats under my feet.

1009
01:29:45,157 --> 01:29:47,031
Look! She's laughing!

1010
01:30:05,260 --> 01:30:08,012
- Mrs Hobday. Do come in.
- I can't stop, my dear.

1011
01:30:08,097 --> 01:30:11,051
I've just come by
to bring you the good news.

1012
01:30:11,141 --> 01:30:14,261
Mr Bistlethwaite,
who brings the milk, you know?

1013
01:30:14,353 --> 01:30:16,476
He's promised
to take the children in!

1014
01:30:16,563 --> 01:30:20,478
He and his wife have got that farm.
Just the place for growing children.

1015
01:30:20,567 --> 01:30:23,272
Put a bit of colour
back in their cheeks.

1016
01:30:23,362 --> 01:30:26,695
Why, what's the matter?
I thought you'd be pleased.

1017
01:30:26,782 --> 01:30:30,696
You told me yourself that you had
no time to take care of children.

1018
01:30:32,037 --> 01:30:35,620
Circumstances have changed somewhat.

1019
01:30:35,708 --> 01:30:38,911
We got a dad now. Mr Browne.

1020
01:30:39,003 --> 01:30:42,952
- Paul!
- Miss Price, is this true?

1021
01:30:43,048 --> 01:30:47,591
Of course. You do want him to stay
with us, don't you, Miss Price?

1022
01:30:49,388 --> 01:30:52,009
I suppose
I hadn't really thought about it.

1023
01:30:52,099 --> 01:30:55,800
What about him?
What do you say about it, Mr Browne?

1024
01:30:57,646 --> 01:31:01,858
It's all rather sudden!
I don't quite know what to say.

1025
01:31:02,818 --> 01:31:04,894
Then I'll leave you two
to talk it over.

1026
01:31:04,987 --> 01:31:08,190
I'll come back in the morning!
Good night!

1027
01:31:14,413 --> 01:31:19,039
It is true, Mr Browne. You are going
to be our father now, aren't you?

1028
01:31:22,546 --> 01:31:26,129
We are rather rushing things,
aren't we?

1029
01:31:27,634 --> 01:31:31,715
Perhaps Mr Browne has other things
besides you children to think about.

1030
01:31:34,892 --> 01:31:37,893
Yes. As a matter of fact
I should have left ages ago.

1031
01:31:37,978 --> 01:31:40,979
I must get a train
back to London tonight.

1032
01:31:41,065 --> 01:31:43,734
It's rather an important matter.

1033
01:31:43,817 --> 01:31:47,685
I'd like to tell you about it,
but it's a little bit hush-hush.

1034
01:31:47,780 --> 01:31:49,404
Sort of a secret.

1035
01:31:51,450 --> 01:31:54,700
Well... if...

1036
01:31:54,787 --> 01:31:59,413
If I've been any sort of help to you,
I'm pleased.

1037
01:31:59,750 --> 01:32:02,371
You've been immensely kind.
Thank you.

1038
01:32:03,128 --> 01:32:05,798
I've enjoyed being with you.

1039
01:32:05,881 --> 01:32:08,123
Perhaps it's been good for all of us.

1040
01:32:08,217 --> 01:32:10,209
Will you be coming back?

1041
01:32:10,302 --> 01:32:13,837
Some day, my dear. I certainly hope
that we shall meet again.

1042
01:32:13,931 --> 01:32:17,514
Some day.
When all this war business is over.

1043
01:32:18,727 --> 01:32:22,310
- I see.
- Perhaps I shall realise my dream.

1044
01:32:22,398 --> 01:32:26,146
Eglantine and Emelius:
Illusionists extraordinary!

1045
01:32:26,235 --> 01:32:28,642
Just think how that
will look on the poster.

1046
01:32:29,905 --> 01:32:32,147
The children are going to miss you.

1047
01:32:34,243 --> 01:32:36,816
- You really think they will?
- Yes.

1048
01:32:37,454 --> 01:32:40,657
Well, I shall miss you. All of you.

1049
01:32:44,420 --> 01:32:46,958
If I don't go now
you might never get rid of me.

1050
01:32:49,842 --> 01:32:51,751
Goodbye, Carrie.

1051
01:32:52,428 --> 01:32:56,377
- Must you really go?
- I think it's best for everybody.

1052
01:32:56,473 --> 01:33:00,008
- Goodbye, Paul.
- I think you should be our father.

1053
01:33:00,769 --> 01:33:02,263
Goodbye, Charlie.

1054
01:33:02,354 --> 01:33:04,976
Do you want me to come down
to the station with you?

1055
01:33:05,065 --> 01:33:10,142
No, no. You stay here
and look after everybody.

1056
01:33:12,948 --> 01:33:16,566
- Goodbye, Miss Price.
- Goodbye, Mr Browne.

1057
01:34:07,670 --> 01:34:11,453
- When is the next train to London?
- Lord bless ye, ain't no train.

1058
01:34:11,548 --> 01:34:14,086
Not until milk job,
4 a.m. Tomorrow morning.

1059
01:34:14,176 --> 01:34:17,379
- Mind if I await it here?
- Suit yourself. Good night, sir.

1060
01:34:17,471 --> 01:34:19,677
Good night.

1061
01:34:41,161 --> 01:34:43,450
Out you go, Cosmic.

1062
01:34:50,921 --> 01:34:52,546
Hello?

1063
01:35:08,731 --> 01:35:12,016
Emelius Browne, do you know
you could be warm and cosy

1064
01:35:12,109 --> 01:35:14,481
in that house at this very moment?

1065
01:35:14,570 --> 01:35:18,982
For once in your useless life,
you really seem to have been needed.

1066
01:35:19,074 --> 01:35:22,028
You're a failure, Emelius Browne,

1067
01:35:22,119 --> 01:35:24,076
and a coward.

1068
01:35:25,456 --> 01:35:29,240
No, Fräulein, this is not
the invasion, just a little exercise.

1069
01:35:29,335 --> 01:35:33,628
A minor raid to induce panic
and to spread a little mischief.

1070
01:35:33,714 --> 01:35:35,920
When you English get it
through your head

1071
01:35:36,008 --> 01:35:39,459
that the German forces can land
whenever and wherever we please,

1072
01:35:39,553 --> 01:35:42,009
perhaps you will consider
reasonable peace.

1073
01:35:42,097 --> 01:35:44,719
Not bloody likely!

1074
01:35:44,808 --> 01:35:47,264
Go on, Miss Price. Do it to him.

1075
01:35:47,353 --> 01:35:50,307
I must say, it's very tempting.

1076
01:35:50,397 --> 01:35:54,810
Colonel, how would you feel
about being turned into a white rabbit?

1077
01:35:57,071 --> 01:36:00,903
I said, how would you feel
about being turned into a white rabbit?

1078
01:36:02,534 --> 01:36:04,112
Be quiet, please.

1079
01:36:07,331 --> 01:36:09,573
Filigree, apogee, epogee...

1080
01:36:11,418 --> 01:36:15,036
- Not again!
- Your memory, Miss Price.

1081
01:36:17,383 --> 01:36:20,218
Would you kindly fetch my notebook
from the workroom?

1082
01:36:20,302 --> 01:36:21,465
Righto.

1083
01:36:26,183 --> 01:36:28,674
Silence!

1084
01:36:29,645 --> 01:36:31,222
We have work to do.

1085
01:36:31,313 --> 01:36:33,982
I am sorry, but I must send
all of you some place

1086
01:36:34,066 --> 01:36:36,391
where you will no longer
be a nuisance.

1087
01:36:47,496 --> 01:36:50,367
As the words sell the tune

1088
01:36:50,457 --> 01:36:53,031
And the moonbeams the moon

1089
01:36:53,127 --> 01:36:57,705
All I need to succeed in my plan

1090
01:36:58,841 --> 01:37:04,511
Is a champion rare
with a flourish and a flair

1091
01:37:40,966 --> 01:37:42,674
Eglantine!

1092
01:39:11,974 --> 01:39:15,473
Where's the spell for rabbits?
The easiest of all, she said.

1093
01:39:17,271 --> 01:39:21,185
Confound it, can't women ever learn
to file things properly?

1094
01:39:27,239 --> 01:39:28,270
Here it is.

1095
01:39:28,365 --> 01:39:32,149
Filigree, apogee, pedigree, perigee.
That's it.

1096
01:39:37,458 --> 01:39:39,534
Filigree...

1097
01:39:39,626 --> 01:39:42,960
apogee, pedigree, perigee.

1098
01:39:50,137 --> 01:39:55,214
Come along. For once in your life,
you've got to believe in something.

1099
01:39:55,309 --> 01:39:56,933
That's it. Good lad.

1100
01:39:58,145 --> 01:40:02,771
Filigree, apogee, pedigree, perigee.

1101
01:40:32,262 --> 01:40:36,260
What's the use of putting us
in that draughty castle?

1102
01:40:36,350 --> 01:40:38,010
It's quite chilly.

1103
01:40:38,102 --> 01:40:42,313
The colonel believes when a British
female decides to become a nuisance,

1104
01:40:42,398 --> 01:40:45,019
she can become
the greatest nuisance in the world,

1105
01:40:45,109 --> 01:40:47,730
and I'm inclined to agree with him.

1106
01:40:48,404 --> 01:40:50,028
You need a lesson in manners.

1107
01:40:50,114 --> 01:40:53,696
If I had my notebook,
I'd make certain you'd learn a few.

1108
01:41:08,465 --> 01:41:10,422
Jumping Jehosophat! More Jerries!

1109
01:41:22,146 --> 01:41:24,684
Take it easy, can't you?

1110
01:41:24,773 --> 01:41:27,264
- Try holding your breath.
- I am holding it.

1111
01:41:27,359 --> 01:41:31,060
We could strip him down
and grease him with soap.

1112
01:41:31,155 --> 01:41:35,733
No, it's no good. We can't do it.

1113
01:41:35,826 --> 01:41:38,743
I could have told you that
in the first place.

1114
01:41:41,290 --> 01:41:45,453
If we can't get Paul out we'll just
have to think of something else.

1115
01:41:45,544 --> 01:41:48,249
What about that spell
that makes things move about?

1116
01:41:48,339 --> 01:41:51,921
- But I'd need weapons.
- How about all these things?

1117
01:41:53,510 --> 01:41:56,180
I'm afraid they're a bit ancient.

1118
01:41:57,514 --> 01:42:01,049
- Where did this come from?
- It's Mr Browne!

1119
01:42:01,143 --> 01:42:04,726
He's on his way to London.

1120
01:42:05,314 --> 01:42:06,345
Mr Browne?

1121
01:42:08,609 --> 01:42:12,060
If you are Mr Browne,
would you get off my lap?

1122
01:42:13,322 --> 01:42:16,276
It is Mr Browne!

1123
01:42:17,368 --> 01:42:20,155
It is you!

1124
01:42:20,245 --> 01:42:23,033
You didn't think
that I could do that spell, did you?

1125
01:42:23,123 --> 01:42:26,907
I am glad to see you!
But what about all these Germans?

1126
01:42:27,002 --> 01:42:30,336
What's wrong with
the substitutiary locomotion spell?

1127
01:42:30,422 --> 01:42:33,257
- That ought to be useful.
- It isn't ready yet.

1128
01:42:33,342 --> 01:42:35,963
- You saw what happened.
- We have to chance it.

1129
01:42:36,053 --> 01:42:39,801
We can't let these so-and-sos
get away with their beastly little raid.

1130
01:42:39,890 --> 01:42:43,010
Won't you get up off the floor?
We'll go to work.

1131
01:43:02,079 --> 01:43:04,118
- Jolly good luck, my dear.
- Thank you.

1132
01:43:04,206 --> 01:43:06,531
Let's hope you haven't
forgotten the spell.

1133
01:43:06,625 --> 01:43:08,914
- Not this time.
- Found this in the castle.

1134
01:43:09,003 --> 01:43:12,169
Probably not magic,
but it might make you feel more at home.

1135
01:43:12,256 --> 01:43:14,877
Thank you.
That was very thoughtful of you.

1136
01:43:14,967 --> 01:43:17,374
Let's get out of Miss Price's way.

1137
01:43:24,435 --> 01:43:27,270
Treguna...

1138
01:43:27,354 --> 01:43:30,557
mekoides...

1139
01:43:30,649 --> 01:43:32,441
trecorum...

1140
01:43:33,652 --> 01:43:37,270
satis dee.

1141
01:43:58,469 --> 01:44:00,342
Look!

1142
01:46:56,146 --> 01:46:58,056
Sound the advance!

1143
01:47:02,569 --> 01:47:04,396
Just in time for the kick-off.

1144
01:47:38,355 --> 01:47:39,897
Steady on the left.

1145
01:47:41,483 --> 01:47:45,563
Victory for England and St George!

1146
01:47:47,197 --> 01:47:48,989
Like a Lord Mayor's show!

1147
01:47:49,074 --> 01:47:51,031
Pikemen, hold your distance.

1148
01:47:51,118 --> 01:47:54,653
Treguna mekoides

1149
01:47:54,747 --> 01:47:58,198
and trecorum satis dee

1150
01:48:30,616 --> 01:48:32,324
Blimey!

1151
01:49:05,484 --> 01:49:08,734
- Where's it coming from?
- Sounds like the sea road, sir.

1152
01:49:08,821 --> 01:49:11,359
Come on, lads! After me.

1153
01:50:46,085 --> 01:50:48,326
Good shooting, bowmen!

1154
01:50:55,511 --> 01:50:58,714
Well caught, sir. Very good.

1155
01:51:06,980 --> 01:51:09,187
Knock his block off! That's it!

1156
01:51:09,274 --> 01:51:12,560
Mr Browne,
make those children take cover!

1157
01:52:20,721 --> 01:52:24,932
Are you still there, Colonel?
I thought you'd be on your way by now.

1158
01:52:28,312 --> 01:52:32,773
You see? Things may not
be so easy for you after all.

1159
01:52:44,953 --> 01:52:46,745
Goodbye, Colonel!

1160
01:53:35,462 --> 01:53:36,873
Eglantine.

1161
01:53:38,173 --> 01:53:39,668
Dear Mr Browne.

1162
01:53:39,758 --> 01:53:43,970
- We thought they'd damaged you.
- See? No one can hurt Miss Price.

1163
01:53:46,015 --> 01:53:49,929
There they are, lads!
I said something was afoot!

1164
01:53:50,019 --> 01:53:52,592
All right. Drive them into the sea.

1165
01:53:52,688 --> 01:53:55,095
Firing positions. Both sides.

1166
01:54:01,071 --> 01:54:03,989
All right, men. Hold your fire.

1167
01:54:07,369 --> 01:54:09,943
I think we've taught
the Hun a lesson.

1168
01:54:10,039 --> 01:54:13,289
He'll think twice
before coming back here again.

1169
01:54:14,710 --> 01:54:19,586
It's tragic. All your spells,
your equipment. All gone.

1170
01:54:19,673 --> 01:54:23,457
Still, I was able to perform
some small service first.

1171
01:54:24,261 --> 01:54:27,796
That mean you ain't gonna
be a witch no more? Never?

1172
01:54:27,890 --> 01:54:32,101
No, Paul. I realised some time ago
that I could never be a proper witch.

1173
01:54:32,186 --> 01:54:36,053
Was it that first magic moment
when you laid eyes on me?

1174
01:54:36,148 --> 01:54:40,609
No. It was the day
my poisoned dragon's liver arrived.

1175
01:54:40,694 --> 01:54:45,273
I knew that anyone who felt the way
I did about poisoned dragon's liver

1176
01:54:45,366 --> 01:54:48,366
had no business being a witch.

1177
01:54:56,210 --> 01:54:59,294
- Certain you're doing the right thing?
- Well, I think so.

1178
01:54:59,380 --> 01:55:01,835
It's much too dangerous
being a civilian.

1179
01:55:01,924 --> 01:55:03,833
Take care of yourself, guv.

1180
01:55:03,926 --> 01:55:07,758
I'll do that. And I'll be back
before you've grown an inch taller.

1181
01:55:07,846 --> 01:55:11,298
- We'll be together again.
- Sounds like you have an escort.

1182
01:55:17,398 --> 01:55:19,639
Well, here we go.

1183
01:55:38,961 --> 01:55:41,962
- Permission to move off, sir.
- Carry on, sergeant.

1184
01:55:44,049 --> 01:55:46,587
Parade, by the right,

1185
01:55:46,677 --> 01:55:48,966
quick march!

1186
01:55:59,773 --> 01:56:05,147
Suppose that's it.
We ain't gonna have no fun no more.

1187
01:56:05,237 --> 01:56:07,479
Still got this, ain't I?

1188
01:56:15,289 --> 01:56:19,417
Call out the navy,
call out the ranks

1189
01:56:19,501 --> 01:56:23,879
Call out the air force,
call out the tanks

1190
01:56:23,964 --> 01:56:27,629
From the cliffs of Dover
call up the gulls

1191
01:56:27,718 --> 01:56:31,763
And don't forget
the loyal territorials

1192
01:56:31,847 --> 01:56:36,805
But who's digging in here?
Who will defend

1193
01:56:36,894 --> 01:56:41,105
Every inch of England,
no matter what they send?

1194
01:56:41,190 --> 01:56:45,104
Who's standing firm
in our own front yard?

1195
01:56:45,194 --> 01:56:49,143
The soldiers of the Old Home Guard,
that's who

1196
01:56:49,239 --> 01:56:54,993
The soldiers of the Old Home Guard
