2
00:00:11,992 --> 00:00:14,097
Ladies and gentlemen,
I'm Mayor Randy Christmas,

3
00:00:14,261 --> 00:00:15,672
of Miami, Florida.

4
00:00:15,830 --> 00:00:18,936
The film you're about to see
is a stunning expose

5
00:00:19,099 --> 00:00:20,476
based on fact.

6
00:00:20,634 --> 00:00:23,615
It concerns a vicious attempt
by organized crime

7
00:00:23,771 --> 00:00:26,615
to take over
the entire state of Florida.

8
00:00:26,774 --> 00:00:29,118
But for the alert
and courageous work

9
00:00:29,276 --> 00:00:31,483
of Florida's
law enforcement agencies

10
00:00:31,645 --> 00:00:32,589
and the integrity

11
00:00:32,713 --> 00:00:35,455
of its governmental
administrations,

12
00:00:35,616 --> 00:00:38,062
this threat might
have been made good.

13
00:00:38,185 --> 00:00:40,290
I take this opportunity
to issue a warning

14
00:00:40,454 --> 00:00:43,458
to the people
of every state in the nation.

15
00:00:43,624 --> 00:00:46,161
It could happen
in your state.

16
00:00:46,327 --> 00:00:48,967
We are dedicated here
in Florida to the belief

17
00:00:49,129 --> 00:00:51,234
that it will never
again happen to us.

18
00:01:54,328 --> 00:01:56,171
[Roberts] My name is Jon Roberts.

19
00:01:56,330 --> 00:01:58,503
I was born in New York.

20
00:01:58,632 --> 00:02:01,408
I lost my father
when I was nine.

21
00:02:01,568 --> 00:02:03,309
My mother when I was 13.

22
00:02:03,437 --> 00:02:06,179
My stepfather threw me
out of the house when I was 13.

23
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:08,183
My sister tried
to raise me,

24
00:02:08,342 --> 00:02:10,686
failed miserably
because of me.

25
00:02:10,811 --> 00:02:13,451
I went to see my uncle,
and my uncle took me in.

26
00:02:13,881 --> 00:02:15,554
First he had me
collecting money

27
00:02:15,716 --> 00:02:16,786
because he was a loan shark.

28
00:02:16,951 --> 00:02:18,089
So he put me
with one of his guys

29
00:02:18,252 --> 00:02:21,529
who also happened to be
the driver for Carlo Gambino.

30
00:02:21,655 --> 00:02:23,635
And my uncle said, "Don't worry,
this guy will take care of you."

31
00:02:23,791 --> 00:02:25,327
Some guy owed
my uncle money.

32
00:02:25,459 --> 00:02:27,268
We kidnapped him,
we threw him in an apartment,

33
00:02:27,428 --> 00:02:29,806
and the guy that I used
to do it with me

34
00:02:29,964 --> 00:02:31,170
was strung out on heroin.

35
00:02:31,298 --> 00:02:32,936
I said, "Look,
I'm going home to sleep,

36
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:34,170
you watch this guy."

37
00:02:34,301 --> 00:02:36,212
Well, he ends up
shooting up and OD-ing,

38
00:02:36,370 --> 00:02:38,179
so the guy he's watching
just opens the door

39
00:02:38,305 --> 00:02:39,215
and walks into the street,

40
00:02:39,373 --> 00:02:41,080
because my friend's
dead on the floor.

41
00:02:41,241 --> 00:02:42,219
He ran to the police.

42
00:02:42,376 --> 00:02:43,446
The police came,
and you know,

43
00:02:43,610 --> 00:02:45,590
they got me
and they put me in...

44
00:02:45,746 --> 00:02:47,817
At that time they had a place
called the Tombs in New York,

45
00:02:47,982 --> 00:02:49,655
which was one
of the original jails.

46
00:02:49,817 --> 00:02:51,353
And they came
around to the Tombs

47
00:02:51,485 --> 00:02:53,362
and they made people offers.

48
00:02:53,487 --> 00:02:55,728
If you go to Vietnam
and you leave

49
00:02:55,856 --> 00:02:58,666
with an honorable discharge,
your charges will be dropped.

50
00:02:58,826 --> 00:03:00,828
I said, "Okay, that
sounds like a good deal."

51
00:03:00,995 --> 00:03:03,976
And I signed up for a year,
and they interview you.

52
00:03:04,131 --> 00:03:05,610
And they said,
"Look, we're going to give you

53
00:03:05,766 --> 00:03:06,767
advanced training.

54
00:03:06,934 --> 00:03:09,141
We're going to send you here
and we're going to make you...

55
00:03:09,436 --> 00:03:12,246
You can do some crazy things
if you want in Vietnam."

56
00:03:12,406 --> 00:03:14,750
And what it was for was,
it was 101st Airborne,

57
00:03:14,875 --> 00:03:18,755
and I got to like it,
because I had a bad mentality,

58
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:20,119
and I ended up
staying there 4 years.

59
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,850
I got blown out of a tree.

60
00:03:22,016 --> 00:03:23,620
I got a metal plate
in my head,

61
00:03:23,784 --> 00:03:26,390
and you know, I don't want to get
into stories over there

62
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:27,396
and shit like that,

63
00:03:27,521 --> 00:03:29,467
because everybody
has a story, so...

64
00:03:29,623 --> 00:03:31,500
And when you come back,
and you can't do anything,

65
00:03:31,658 --> 00:03:33,467
it's like,
what am I trained to do?

66
00:03:33,627 --> 00:03:34,765
And I lost everything.

67
00:03:34,895 --> 00:03:36,772
My uncle, he said to me,
"You and I are going

68
00:03:36,897 --> 00:03:37,967
to make a lot of
money together,"

69
00:03:38,132 --> 00:03:40,271
and we opened
a restaurant there.

70
00:03:40,434 --> 00:03:42,641
Opened it? We bought it
or took it from somebody,

71
00:03:42,803 --> 00:03:44,009
if I remember,
back in my childhood.

72
00:03:44,171 --> 00:03:45,650
And it was called
Alice's Restaurant,

73
00:03:45,806 --> 00:03:47,513
and then we went into
nightclubs and we opened

74
00:03:47,674 --> 00:03:48,880
about four or five
nightclubs.

75
00:03:49,042 --> 00:03:52,114
It became very big
and we were doing really well.

76
00:03:52,279 --> 00:03:54,418
One day they just
came in, the police,

77
00:03:54,548 --> 00:03:55,788
and they told us
that our partner,

78
00:03:55,916 --> 00:03:58,260
they had found him out
on the Long Island expressway.

79
00:03:58,385 --> 00:03:59,159
And he had been killed

80
00:03:59,319 --> 00:04:00,730
and he had like
11 bullet holes in him.

81
00:04:00,888 --> 00:04:02,731
So, who knows
what happened to him?

82
00:04:02,890 --> 00:04:04,870
The best thing that
I could think at that time was,

83
00:04:05,025 --> 00:04:06,504
"Just let me get away
from all this heat,"

84
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:09,504
so I moved down here.

85
00:04:09,663 --> 00:04:12,439
And started
into the cocaine business.

86
00:04:23,944 --> 00:04:26,447
[Buchanan] I think there's something
about the location here.

87
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:29,493
It's at the end of the map,
the bottom of the map,

88
00:04:29,616 --> 00:04:31,152
the jumping off place.

89
00:04:31,318 --> 00:04:33,924
People who are running
away from each other

90
00:04:34,088 --> 00:04:37,194
or from the law or from their
own personal demons.

91
00:04:37,357 --> 00:04:40,065
Eventually if they run long
enough, they come here.

92
00:04:55,542 --> 00:04:58,489
[man] The City of Miami area
was very, very quiet,

93
00:04:58,612 --> 00:05:01,320
and it was just
a very pleasant place to live.

94
00:05:01,448 --> 00:05:02,950
[Roberts] Miami
back then was the South.

95
00:05:03,117 --> 00:05:03,959
It was like Alabama.

96
00:05:04,118 --> 00:05:05,961
There was no money here,
there were no big buildings.

97
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,724
Downtown was pretty barren.

98
00:05:07,888 --> 00:05:10,562
Miami Beach,
it was a lot of old people

99
00:05:10,724 --> 00:05:12,499
just sitting around
in rocking chairs

100
00:05:12,626 --> 00:05:14,105
on South Beach waiting to die.

101
00:05:14,261 --> 00:05:16,935
It was a whole different world
down here back then.

102
00:05:35,649 --> 00:05:37,219
[man] I'm an old South
Florida boy,

103
00:05:37,384 --> 00:05:39,762
and one of the few that's
that old, I was born here.

104
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:42,526
I was in the
import business,

105
00:05:42,656 --> 00:05:45,262
doing some exporting,
but mostly importing.

106
00:05:56,270 --> 00:05:58,682
[Roberts] Back then the city
was like a virgin city.

107
00:05:59,439 --> 00:06:02,784
[man 1] South Florida was
vulnerable to penetration

108
00:06:02,943 --> 00:06:04,547
by drug suppliers.

109
00:06:04,678 --> 00:06:07,022
[man 2] Florida is a drug
smuggler's paradise.

110
00:06:07,181 --> 00:06:08,751
It was wide open back then.

111
00:06:08,882 --> 00:06:09,792
It was wide open.

112
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:12,089
[man 1] 1200 miles of coastline,
much of it remote,

113
00:06:12,252 --> 00:06:14,163
deserted, thousands
of rivers and bays.

114
00:06:14,321 --> 00:06:17,825
Nobody even knows
how many islands offshore.

115
00:06:17,991 --> 00:06:20,164
[man 2] The pirates operated
here in the 1700s.

116
00:06:20,327 --> 00:06:22,238
During the Civil War,
gunrunners would run

117
00:06:22,362 --> 00:06:24,308
the Union blockade
in from the Bahamas.

118
00:06:24,464 --> 00:06:26,466
Rum runners used
the same technique.

119
00:06:26,633 --> 00:06:29,944
[Munday] This city has always
had something coming in.

120
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:32,482
[man] In the 1960s, this was
a jumping-off place

121
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:33,982
for soldiers of fortune,

122
00:06:34,141 --> 00:06:36,246
who ran commando raids
into Cuba.

123
00:06:36,376 --> 00:06:38,617
Several dozen miles
south-west of Miami

124
00:06:38,745 --> 00:06:41,988
is a military training camp
located on 40 miles

125
00:06:42,149 --> 00:06:44,595
of Everglades swamp land
for Cuban refugees

126
00:06:44,718 --> 00:06:47,324
who are planning to return
to the island to fight.

127
00:06:47,487 --> 00:06:49,694
These guys had been
trained by the CIA,

128
00:06:49,856 --> 00:06:51,130
had gone
into the fishing industry,

129
00:06:51,291 --> 00:06:52,964
and they were making
a very good living.

130
00:06:53,093 --> 00:06:56,700
The change in 1975
was precipitated by a lobster.

131
00:06:56,863 --> 00:06:59,503
There was a law changed
in the Bahamas

132
00:06:59,666 --> 00:07:03,671
which prohibited Cuban exiles
based in Miami from fishing

133
00:07:03,837 --> 00:07:06,477
in Bahamian waters
for the spiny lobster.

134
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:10,850
It put out of work tremendous
amount of fishermen.

135
00:07:11,011 --> 00:07:13,150
[man] Obedio Perez
sold his gold watch

136
00:07:13,313 --> 00:07:15,224
and ring last week
to feed his two children.

137
00:07:16,016 --> 00:07:18,519
He expects the bank
to foreclose on his boat

138
00:07:18,685 --> 00:07:19,629
before month's end.

139
00:07:19,753 --> 00:07:22,029
Francisco Gado's boat
is taking on water

140
00:07:22,189 --> 00:07:23,361
from lack of use.

141
00:07:23,523 --> 00:07:25,628
He says it might sink
before his next payment.

142
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:27,898
More than 1,000
other lobster fishermen,

143
00:07:28,061 --> 00:07:29,904
a majority of them
Cuban exiles,

144
00:07:30,063 --> 00:07:31,906
have not left these
docks in six weeks.

145
00:07:32,065 --> 00:07:34,909
[Diaz] They had their boats,
they had their knowledge,

146
00:07:35,068 --> 00:07:36,411
they had the training.

147
00:07:36,570 --> 00:07:38,675
That's when we started seeing

148
00:07:38,805 --> 00:07:42,548
the mother lode method
of transporting marijuana.

149
00:07:42,709 --> 00:07:44,882
The fishermen were acting
as intermediaries,

150
00:07:45,045 --> 00:07:45,887
and the go-fast boats

151
00:07:46,046 --> 00:07:47,047
would bring them
into the coast.

152
00:07:47,214 --> 00:07:50,423
At that time everybody
in Florida was smuggling pot.

153
00:07:50,584 --> 00:07:52,928
And you could drive
in with a boat, stacked up,

154
00:07:53,086 --> 00:07:54,190
[Munday] ] pull up to the dock
and unload it.

155
00:07:54,354 --> 00:07:55,264
Nobody said a thing.

156
00:07:55,422 --> 00:07:57,698
There was no defense
of the border to speak of.

157
00:07:57,824 --> 00:08:00,031
[woman] There were thousands
of fishing boats in this area,

158
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,798
hundreds of thousands
of pleasure boats.

159
00:08:01,962 --> 00:08:04,067
Many of them capable
of the run to the Bahamas,

160
00:08:04,231 --> 00:08:05,938
with another ship
on a marijuana

161
00:08:06,099 --> 00:08:08,443
delivery cruise out
in the Gulf Stream.

162
00:08:08,602 --> 00:08:09,706
[Munday] If they thought
there was a problem,

163
00:08:09,836 --> 00:08:10,780
they'd just throw it
overboard.

164
00:08:10,937 --> 00:08:14,976
They would order 40,000 pounds
and they'd send out 50,000.

165
00:08:15,142 --> 00:08:16,712
And they'd only have
enough boats to carry

166
00:08:16,843 --> 00:08:18,345
the 40 and they would
throw the stuff away.

167
00:08:18,478 --> 00:08:19,957
You could be out in a boat

168
00:08:20,113 --> 00:08:22,457
and find bales
of marijuana floating.

169
00:08:22,616 --> 00:08:25,256
The proverbial square grouper.

170
00:08:25,419 --> 00:08:27,057
You would get guys
who would go over,

171
00:08:27,187 --> 00:08:29,098
unload the ship, and they would
get their dentist

172
00:08:29,256 --> 00:08:30,826
or their attorney
or their doctor,

173
00:08:31,091 --> 00:08:32,798
because forevermore
he could tell

174
00:08:32,959 --> 00:08:35,132
his grandchildren,
"I was a smuggler."

175
00:08:35,295 --> 00:08:36,774
[man] South Florida has become
the drug smuggling

176
00:08:36,930 --> 00:08:39,308
capital of the United States.

177
00:08:39,466 --> 00:08:42,379
No other place in the
country even comes close.

178
00:08:42,502 --> 00:08:43,742
The first marijuana
trip we made,

179
00:08:43,870 --> 00:08:45,577
we found through
a guy who was a fireman.

180
00:08:45,739 --> 00:08:47,741
He had a twin engine plane
called the Piper Aztec

181
00:08:47,874 --> 00:08:50,480
that he would fly to Colombia.

182
00:08:50,644 --> 00:08:52,624
He offered us, if we would
go down and pick up

183
00:08:52,779 --> 00:08:54,725
1,000 pounds, $50,000.

184
00:08:54,848 --> 00:08:57,192
I really wasn't thrilled about
the amount of money it was,

185
00:08:57,351 --> 00:08:58,329
but I said,
"Well, at least it gets

186
00:08:58,485 --> 00:08:59,395
our foot in the door."

187
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:02,830
And we did it. And it was
a fiasco from one end

188
00:09:02,989 --> 00:09:03,865
to the other.

189
00:09:04,024 --> 00:09:07,767
We ended up having
to throw it all away.

190
00:09:07,894 --> 00:09:10,033
They didn't have an alternate
where we came back to.

191
00:09:10,197 --> 00:09:12,973
There was a sentinel police
officer sitting on

192
00:09:13,133 --> 00:09:14,737
the road that they wanted
to land on.

193
00:09:15,001 --> 00:09:19,643
They used a used airplane
radio on an old battery,

194
00:09:19,806 --> 00:09:22,514
and they didn't realize
the battery was dead.

195
00:09:22,676 --> 00:09:24,656
From that trip,
our very first trip,

196
00:09:24,811 --> 00:09:27,792
with all the problems,
we took it as a lesson.

197
00:09:27,914 --> 00:09:30,019
From then on in,
we'd have one, two, three,

198
00:09:30,183 --> 00:09:31,355
four alternates.

199
00:09:31,518 --> 00:09:34,362
I ran into some Jamaicans,
went down to Jamaica,

200
00:09:34,521 --> 00:09:36,432
physically looked
at the place.

201
00:09:36,556 --> 00:09:39,298
For Jamaicans it was...
The pot wasn't really good.

202
00:09:39,459 --> 00:09:41,439
We made one trip,
brought back 700 pounds,

203
00:09:41,561 --> 00:09:43,700
but this time we brought it
back to our place.

204
00:09:43,864 --> 00:09:46,640
People that I knew, they were
all calling the ground crew.

205
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:49,872
They were all my friends,
and the vehicles were mine.

206
00:09:50,036 --> 00:09:51,310
I tried to control
everything.

207
00:09:51,471 --> 00:09:53,246
It got to the point
where there was

208
00:09:53,407 --> 00:09:55,250
so much pot here
that you couldn't sell it.

209
00:09:55,409 --> 00:09:56,615
It was too cheap.

210
00:09:56,743 --> 00:09:58,916
Got down, it was like
$230 a pound,

211
00:09:59,079 --> 00:10:00,524
and what you had
to pay for it,

212
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:02,353
and you figured your expenses
and everything,

213
00:10:02,516 --> 00:10:04,792
and the chances
that you take, legally.

214
00:10:04,918 --> 00:10:06,261
[man] Big seizures
used to be measured

215
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:07,797
in hundreds of pounds.

216
00:10:07,921 --> 00:10:09,901
It is not unusual
now to catch a ship

217
00:10:10,056 --> 00:10:13,037
with 30 or 40 tons
of marijuana.

218
00:10:13,193 --> 00:10:15,400
[Munday] For the same
amount of money

219
00:10:15,562 --> 00:10:17,007
that you would make
on 40,000 pounds,

220
00:10:17,130 --> 00:10:18,803
you could bring
1,000 pounds of cocaine

221
00:10:18,932 --> 00:10:21,071
and make the same amount
if not more.

222
00:10:21,234 --> 00:10:23,407
When they were sending,
like, all this pot,

223
00:10:23,570 --> 00:10:25,413
they would send
a few kilos of coke.

224
00:10:25,572 --> 00:10:27,643
[man] As for marijuana,
the police might be able

225
00:10:27,774 --> 00:10:29,754
to stop it.
But as for cocaine,

226
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:31,753
the police have
no real answers.

227
00:10:31,912 --> 00:10:33,687
[Roberts] In the beginning,
it was very small.

228
00:10:33,847 --> 00:10:34,951
[Munday]
Because it was so expensive.

229
00:10:35,115 --> 00:10:37,527
[Roberts] And they would
bring them in a suitcase.

230
00:10:37,684 --> 00:10:40,392
[man] In the last year,
cocaine seizures have doubled.

231
00:10:40,554 --> 00:10:42,659
More than a quarter
of all cocaine seizures

232
00:10:42,789 --> 00:10:45,292
in the United States were
at Miami International Airport.

233
00:10:45,459 --> 00:10:47,666
While we were filming
a routine day,

234
00:10:47,794 --> 00:10:48,932
agents got another one.

235
00:10:49,095 --> 00:10:52,133
Five pounds of pure cocaine
were hidden in the bag.

236
00:10:52,299 --> 00:10:54,711
U.S. Customs said the seizure
was worth more than

237
00:10:54,868 --> 00:10:56,848
$1,000,000.

238
00:10:56,970 --> 00:10:58,313
[Roberts] When I first
came down here,

239
00:10:58,472 --> 00:11:00,577
I really had no idea
what I was going to do,

240
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:02,310
and I worked with
a guy training dogs.

241
00:11:02,476 --> 00:11:05,047
Agitating the dogs
and letting the dogs hit

242
00:11:05,178 --> 00:11:07,624
a sleeve and bite me.
And doing that,

243
00:11:07,781 --> 00:11:09,954
I met a Cuban man
out in Hialeah,

244
00:11:10,116 --> 00:11:13,063
who became very notorious,
very famous down here,

245
00:11:13,186 --> 00:11:15,223
and his name was
Albert San Pedro.

246
00:11:15,355 --> 00:11:16,925
He was in the
drug business.

247
00:11:17,090 --> 00:11:19,593
It was obvious.
I got him a really bad dog.

248
00:11:19,759 --> 00:11:22,171
His name was Sarge.
He was a German Shepherd.

249
00:11:22,329 --> 00:11:23,330
And this dog was crazy.

250
00:11:23,497 --> 00:11:25,101
I mean, absolutely nuts.

251
00:11:25,265 --> 00:11:26,972
And his stash was
under the doghouse

252
00:11:27,133 --> 00:11:28,237
on the side of the house.

253
00:11:28,368 --> 00:11:31,178
He would lift the doghouse up
and he had a cement pad.

254
00:11:31,338 --> 00:11:32,817
And in the cement
pad he had a safe.

255
00:11:32,973 --> 00:11:35,453
And this dog would sleep
on this pad day and night.

256
00:11:35,609 --> 00:11:37,247
And this was
his way of stashing it.

257
00:11:37,377 --> 00:11:39,482
Eventually he was
my main supplier.

258
00:11:39,646 --> 00:11:42,126
He would front me
a quarter of a pound,

259
00:11:42,282 --> 00:11:44,262
and he would give me
like three or four days.

260
00:11:44,384 --> 00:11:46,455
And then I would go
and bring him the money back.

261
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:48,759
[woman] Shortly after midnight,
Hialeah businessman

262
00:11:48,922 --> 00:11:52,369
Alberto San Pedro was arrested
again at his palatial home.

263
00:11:52,526 --> 00:11:55,370
So far he stands accused
of conspiracy to commit murder,

264
00:11:55,529 --> 00:11:57,031
drug dealing
and corruption.

265
00:11:57,197 --> 00:11:58,505
San Pedro brags

266
00:11:58,665 --> 00:12:00,645
he controls the majority of
the Dade County Commission,

267
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:03,747
its mayor and no less than
15 judges.

268
00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:06,282
No mention was made by
any of the council members

269
00:12:06,406 --> 00:12:10,479
or Mayor Raul Martinez
of the San Pedro affair.

270
00:12:10,644 --> 00:12:13,386
[man] There is no organized
crime group

271
00:12:13,547 --> 00:12:15,220
that's going
to challenge the Cubans.

272
00:12:15,382 --> 00:12:20,456
In Miami, the Colombian
drug organizations

273
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:22,031
stepped into that market.

274
00:12:22,188 --> 00:12:23,758
[man] Worried Colombian
authorities say

275
00:12:23,890 --> 00:12:26,063
they are now seeing
increased coca planting

276
00:12:26,226 --> 00:12:28,672
as Colombian traffickers
try to take over all phases

277
00:12:28,828 --> 00:12:30,171
of cocaine production.

278
00:12:30,330 --> 00:12:32,310
[Diaz] it was very clear to us
that the Colombians

279
00:12:32,432 --> 00:12:36,005
were already getting involved
in the distribution area

280
00:12:36,169 --> 00:12:37,147
here in the States.

281
00:12:37,270 --> 00:12:39,944
The Colombians realized
that they were giving up

282
00:12:40,073 --> 00:12:42,053
a large portion
of the profit to people

283
00:12:42,208 --> 00:12:43,812
they really didn't have
to give it up from.

284
00:12:43,977 --> 00:12:46,321
They didn't need
the Cuban as a middleman.

285
00:12:46,446 --> 00:12:48,858
And they just bypassed
the Cubans completely.

286
00:12:49,015 --> 00:12:52,394
That toehold is what sprouted into

287
00:12:52,552 --> 00:12:55,158
the crazy 1980s here in Miami.

288
00:12:56,923 --> 00:13:00,427
These people didn't have
a pilot or plane.

289
00:13:00,594 --> 00:13:02,073
They asked if we'd be
interested,

290
00:13:02,228 --> 00:13:04,401
and I'm trying to be
really, really, really careful.

291
00:13:04,564 --> 00:13:06,703
You have to be careful
of who you meet,

292
00:13:06,866 --> 00:13:07,708
who you talk to.

293
00:13:07,867 --> 00:13:10,040
You might be the police officer
on undercover,

294
00:13:10,203 --> 00:13:13,207
because that's really
starting to roll at that time.

295
00:13:13,373 --> 00:13:15,353
We set up an appointment
to meet these people,

296
00:13:15,475 --> 00:13:17,648
and what I did was,
I bought the most expensive

297
00:13:17,777 --> 00:13:20,553
portable tape
recorder I could find.

298
00:13:20,714 --> 00:13:22,819
And I went to a bunch
of different locations.

299
00:13:22,949 --> 00:13:25,190
And what I found was
the best place

300
00:13:25,318 --> 00:13:26,729
of all was a bowling alley.

301
00:13:26,886 --> 00:13:29,457
I mean, the noise,
the people, the clanging.

302
00:13:29,623 --> 00:13:31,102
The reason
I'm doing this is,

303
00:13:31,257 --> 00:13:32,099
if I'm meeting somebody,

304
00:13:32,259 --> 00:13:33,465
and they're trying
to record our conversation,

305
00:13:33,627 --> 00:13:34,469
I wanted to make sure
there wasn't

306
00:13:34,627 --> 00:13:35,901
going to be much recorded.

307
00:13:36,062 --> 00:13:37,405
And when we got
to the place,

308
00:13:37,564 --> 00:13:41,205
I had three
of my friends outside.

309
00:13:41,334 --> 00:13:42,404
We all have radios.

310
00:13:42,569 --> 00:13:43,604
There was no cell phones
at that time.

311
00:13:43,770 --> 00:13:46,444
There were,
but they were like this big.

312
00:13:46,606 --> 00:13:47,482
When we came out

313
00:13:47,641 --> 00:13:49,086
from after the meeting
I told them that

314
00:13:49,242 --> 00:13:51,119
we'd have to make a decision
and we'd get back to them.

315
00:13:51,278 --> 00:13:55,749
And I had my friends
follow the people home,

316
00:13:55,915 --> 00:13:57,258
just to make sure
that they didn't go back

317
00:13:57,417 --> 00:13:59,727
to the DEA building,
the FBI building,

318
00:13:59,886 --> 00:14:02,560
U.S. Customs or whatever.
And then we sat on them

319
00:14:02,722 --> 00:14:05,293
for three days to make sure
that they were

320
00:14:05,458 --> 00:14:07,267
who they said they were.
These people that turned out

321
00:14:07,427 --> 00:14:09,771
to be Rafa and Max.

322
00:14:15,669 --> 00:14:19,617
They threw a number at us
that was more than agreeable.

323
00:14:19,773 --> 00:14:23,118
$3,000 apiece
or a kilo in your terms,

324
00:14:23,276 --> 00:14:25,654
and they wanted
to move at least 400,

325
00:14:25,812 --> 00:14:27,485
a gross of $1.2 million.

326
00:14:27,647 --> 00:14:28,523
I just transported.

327
00:14:28,682 --> 00:14:31,128
I took it from them,
gave it back to them.

328
00:14:31,284 --> 00:14:32,786
Give me money,
I'll go again.

329
00:14:32,952 --> 00:14:34,431
I wasn't worried
about them,

330
00:14:34,554 --> 00:14:36,659
because I had no intentions
of ever stealing from them.

331
00:14:36,823 --> 00:14:39,360
I had no intentions
of ever cheating them.

332
00:14:39,526 --> 00:14:41,631
All I wanted to do
was make money.

333
00:14:41,795 --> 00:14:43,638
And money we made.

334
00:14:45,031 --> 00:14:46,635
Sunny and Rico
at the same bar.

335
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,302
How lucky can a girl get?

336
00:14:48,468 --> 00:14:49,310
Laura.

337
00:14:49,469 --> 00:14:50,539
[Mooney]
My name's Toni Mooney.

338
00:14:50,703 --> 00:14:53,547
I was born
in Miami, Florida.

339
00:14:53,707 --> 00:14:55,084
After I graduated
high school,

340
00:14:55,208 --> 00:14:57,814
I met somebody named
Shelton Archer,

341
00:14:57,977 --> 00:14:59,957
and he was a photographer.

342
00:15:00,113 --> 00:15:01,091
And he came up to me

343
00:15:01,214 --> 00:15:02,693
and told me
I should be a model.

344
00:15:02,849 --> 00:15:04,692
He had a Limey accent.

345
00:15:04,851 --> 00:15:06,387
He said he would like
to photograph me

346
00:15:06,553 --> 00:15:07,463
at the airport.

347
00:15:07,587 --> 00:15:08,463
He had a plane.

348
00:15:08,588 --> 00:15:09,464
I ended up going with him

349
00:15:09,589 --> 00:15:11,694
to his plane
in Lantana Airport,

350
00:15:11,858 --> 00:15:14,202
and he shot
photographs of me.

351
00:15:18,998 --> 00:15:21,239
Most models have to struggle,
and I must say,

352
00:15:21,401 --> 00:15:24,211
because of Shelton,
I had a fabulous,

353
00:15:24,371 --> 00:15:26,112
very beautiful apartment.

354
00:15:26,372 --> 00:15:27,851
He went out and bought me
a Mini Cooper.

355
00:15:28,007 --> 00:15:29,680
I had a maid, everything.

356
00:15:29,843 --> 00:15:31,845
Cash is a whole
lot better than plastic,

357
00:15:32,011 --> 00:15:34,218
and Shelton always seemed
to have plenty of it.

358
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:35,484
And if he didn't he went
and got more.

359
00:15:35,615 --> 00:15:36,593
He was a photographer.

360
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:37,990
I mean, he seemed
like it to me.

361
00:15:38,151 --> 00:15:38,993
Of course,
it was a little strange

362
00:15:39,152 --> 00:15:39,994
he was living in Colombia.

363
00:15:40,153 --> 00:15:42,599
Then he told me
he had a job for me

364
00:15:42,755 --> 00:15:44,359
in Santo Domingo.

365
00:15:44,524 --> 00:15:46,333
I didn't realize I was going
to know him so well,

366
00:15:46,459 --> 00:15:48,370
but we had a plane crash.

367
00:15:48,528 --> 00:15:51,998
The first leg of the trip,
he woke me up and told me

368
00:15:52,165 --> 00:15:54,236
he wasn't sure if we were
going to make it.

369
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:56,846
We ended up crash
landing the plane.

370
00:15:57,003 --> 00:15:58,380
We were there like,
seven days.

371
00:15:58,538 --> 00:16:00,211
We didn't have any water.
We were licking

372
00:16:00,373 --> 00:16:03,286
condensation off the plane,
and it was quite a mess.

373
00:16:03,443 --> 00:16:06,617
Finally, the coastguard
came and rescued us.

374
00:16:06,779 --> 00:16:09,157
The Bahamians apparently
had been looking for us,

375
00:16:09,282 --> 00:16:11,023
but once they found out
Shelton's M.O.,

376
00:16:11,184 --> 00:16:13,027
the Piper plane
and all that,

377
00:16:13,186 --> 00:16:14,256
they just didn't
go pick him up,

378
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:16,832
because he had been convicted
of drug smuggling there.

379
00:16:16,956 --> 00:16:18,264
When they finally
picked us up,

380
00:16:18,424 --> 00:16:19,835
they believed my story that

381
00:16:20,126 --> 00:16:21,628
I was just really
catching a ride,

382
00:16:21,795 --> 00:16:24,537
and they let me go
and they detained him.

383
00:16:26,566 --> 00:16:29,877
I flew to Miami,
and I was working

384
00:16:30,036 --> 00:16:32,414
on a shoot with a girl,
and she told me

385
00:16:32,572 --> 00:16:36,543
that she had somebody
for me to meet.

386
00:16:36,676 --> 00:16:38,417
A friend of mine
fixed me up with her.

387
00:16:38,578 --> 00:16:39,454
He was a lawyer.

388
00:16:39,612 --> 00:16:41,421
He was dating
this really beautiful girl

389
00:16:41,581 --> 00:16:43,117
who was a model for Ford.

390
00:16:43,283 --> 00:16:45,285
And he said, "You know,
she's got a beautiful friend,

391
00:16:45,451 --> 00:16:46,759
and she lives in West Palm,

392
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:48,297
but she works in New York,

393
00:16:48,455 --> 00:16:49,661
and I'd like
to introduce you to her."

394
00:16:49,823 --> 00:16:50,858
And that's how I met her.

395
00:16:50,990 --> 00:16:53,027
Her and her boyfriend
kept telling me,

396
00:16:53,159 --> 00:16:55,799
"Don't do this and don't drink
in front of John and don't..."

397
00:16:55,962 --> 00:16:58,408
You know, and I was like,
"Whoa whoa whoa.

398
00:16:58,531 --> 00:17:01,034
Wait a minute here.
I don't even want to go."

399
00:17:01,167 --> 00:17:02,942
And then we opened the door
and there's this guy

400
00:17:03,102 --> 00:17:05,207
with this face, you know.
He looks so mean,

401
00:17:05,338 --> 00:17:06,942
and actually I found out
he wasn't.

402
00:17:07,106 --> 00:17:10,087
He was a wonderful person.

403
00:17:10,243 --> 00:17:11,415
I remember
sleeping on the couch,

404
00:17:11,544 --> 00:17:14,218
and Jon bringing out blankets
and covering me up.

405
00:17:14,347 --> 00:17:15,587
The next morning I woke up.

406
00:17:15,715 --> 00:17:16,955
I was on the couch.

407
00:17:17,116 --> 00:17:20,222
He told me he'd like to take me
to see his racehorses.

408
00:17:20,353 --> 00:17:22,333
And I loved horses.
I grew up with horses.

409
00:17:22,488 --> 00:17:24,297
So I said, "Okay."

410
00:17:24,457 --> 00:17:25,936
When I was growing up,
it was just myself,

411
00:17:26,092 --> 00:17:27,594
my brother and my mother.

412
00:17:27,727 --> 00:17:32,699
And Jon really put our
family together in our eyes.

413
00:17:32,866 --> 00:17:34,607
And we really
adored him.

414
00:17:34,734 --> 00:17:37,305
I mean, there wasn't anything
he could do wrong.

415
00:17:37,470 --> 00:17:38,540
It's like a dream,
you know.

416
00:17:38,705 --> 00:17:40,981
You can have
anything you wanted.

417
00:17:41,141 --> 00:17:42,814
Jon made everything
all right.

418
00:17:42,976 --> 00:17:45,684
He was a pretty magnanimous
person back then.

419
00:17:45,845 --> 00:17:47,847
Everything
was hunky dory at home

420
00:17:48,014 --> 00:17:49,550
and everybody was happy and...

421
00:17:51,851 --> 00:17:54,627
But then things changed
when he met Shelton.

422
00:17:54,754 --> 00:17:56,324
[Roberts]
I was selling at that time.

423
00:17:56,489 --> 00:17:58,264
The Cubans
didn't have big supplies,

424
00:17:58,391 --> 00:18:01,201
so I had to search out
other people.

425
00:18:01,361 --> 00:18:03,739
This girl, who I happened
to have been seeing,

426
00:18:03,897 --> 00:18:06,878
knew an English guy who was
a pilot for these people

427
00:18:07,033 --> 00:18:07,977
from Medellin.

428
00:18:08,134 --> 00:18:10,273
So she introduced me to him,
and he said,

429
00:18:10,403 --> 00:18:11,347
"Well, I'm going to hook you up.

430
00:18:11,504 --> 00:18:13,882
I can take you to these
Colombians that I know,

431
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:16,213
and this guy can give you
whatever you want."

432
00:18:16,376 --> 00:18:18,287
And I'd heard stories
like that many times,

433
00:18:18,411 --> 00:18:20,015
so I just said,
"Sure, whenever you're ready,

434
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:21,124
let me know."

435
00:18:21,247 --> 00:18:23,284
And we drove
to Sunny Isles, Florida.

436
00:18:23,416 --> 00:18:24,724
And we go into this house.

437
00:18:24,884 --> 00:18:26,886
It was about
five or six Colombians there,

438
00:18:27,053 --> 00:18:28,532
all like, loaded to bear.

439
00:18:28,688 --> 00:18:29,894
When I say "loaded,"
they were strapped.

440
00:18:30,056 --> 00:18:31,660
They had pistols,
machine guns,

441
00:18:31,791 --> 00:18:33,168
and they were
all standing around.

442
00:18:33,326 --> 00:18:35,772
And at that point
I realized this guy is serious.

443
00:18:35,929 --> 00:18:37,875
This is for real.
I meet this little guy,

444
00:18:38,031 --> 00:18:40,375
he can't be more than
5'4" or 5'5".

445
00:18:40,533 --> 00:18:41,511
And he introduces himself
and he says,

446
00:18:41,634 --> 00:18:42,544
"My name is Rafa."

447
00:18:42,702 --> 00:18:43,544
And he's telling me,

448
00:18:43,703 --> 00:18:44,773
<i>"I'll</i> give you
whatever you want.

449
00:18:44,938 --> 00:18:46,178
And if you've got
some money,

450
00:18:46,339 --> 00:18:48,182
I'll front you twice
the amount of money

451
00:18:48,341 --> 00:18:49,615
that you come with."

452
00:18:49,776 --> 00:18:52,518
And I said, "Well,
you know, show me something."

453
00:18:52,645 --> 00:18:54,556
He takes me in his back room,
he pushes a button,

454
00:18:54,714 --> 00:18:56,193
and a whole wall
opens up like this.

455
00:18:56,349 --> 00:18:59,023
And I had never seen so much
cocaine in my entire life,

456
00:18:59,185 --> 00:19:00,892
just sitting
behind this wall.

457
00:19:01,054 --> 00:19:02,692
I said, "Okay, I guess
you can help me, man."

458
00:19:02,822 --> 00:19:04,927
I said, "Give me a day
and I'll put together the money,

459
00:19:05,091 --> 00:19:06,263
and I'll be back."

460
00:19:06,426 --> 00:19:09,066
The next day I came,
he had an American guy there,

461
00:19:09,229 --> 00:19:10,902
and he introduced
this American.

462
00:19:11,064 --> 00:19:12,202
He said,
"This is my compadre.

463
00:19:12,365 --> 00:19:15,175
I'm not in town a lot,
but whatever it is you need,

464
00:19:15,301 --> 00:19:16,939
this is the man,
he'll take care of you.

465
00:19:17,103 --> 00:19:18,639
And don't worry about it.

466
00:19:18,805 --> 00:19:21,251
He's 100%."

467
00:19:21,407 --> 00:19:22,545
And the man
he introduced me to

468
00:19:22,675 --> 00:19:24,746
happened to be this man,
Max Mermelstein.

469
00:19:24,944 --> 00:19:26,446
Jon introduced me to Max.

470
00:19:26,613 --> 00:19:27,455
I thought
they were going to open

471
00:19:27,614 --> 00:19:30,220
a shoe store together
or some story like that.

472
00:19:30,383 --> 00:19:33,091
[Roberts] Rafa came to trust
Max because Max was married

473
00:19:33,253 --> 00:19:34,664
to a Colombian woman.

474
00:19:34,821 --> 00:19:36,823
She was the cousin
of Pablo Escobar,

475
00:19:36,990 --> 00:19:38,367
the woman Max
was married to.

476
00:19:38,491 --> 00:19:40,471
So they had a bond
with Max.

477
00:19:40,627 --> 00:19:43,972
Max seemed like
a very nice guy back then.

478
00:19:44,130 --> 00:19:46,371
It seemed that way, anyway.

479
00:19:46,499 --> 00:19:48,604
[Roberts] One Sunday,
Max had a party out there,

480
00:19:48,768 --> 00:19:49,610
and I went out to his farm.

481
00:19:49,769 --> 00:19:51,373
The next thing
I know here comes this guy,

482
00:19:51,504 --> 00:19:53,381
and Max says,
"This is my transportation guy.

483
00:19:53,506 --> 00:19:54,484
You're going
to work with him."

484
00:19:54,641 --> 00:19:57,588
He's got like two ATCs,
these three-wheelers,

485
00:19:57,710 --> 00:19:59,621
and he says, "Max,
I brought your ATCs back."

486
00:19:59,779 --> 00:20:00,985
And he takes them
off the truck.

487
00:20:01,147 --> 00:20:04,253
He says, "That one runs
about 90 or 100 mph now.

488
00:20:04,417 --> 00:20:05,691
That one over there
runs around 80."

489
00:20:05,852 --> 00:20:07,126
So Max says,
"I'm telling you, these guys,

490
00:20:07,286 --> 00:20:08,128
these are the shit, man.

491
00:20:08,288 --> 00:20:10,325
We don't have any more.
This is who you'll work with."

492
00:20:10,490 --> 00:20:11,764
So the guy
introduces himself.

493
00:20:11,891 --> 00:20:12,995
His name is Mickey Munday,

494
00:20:13,159 --> 00:20:14,866
and he's like a redneck
from Florida,

495
00:20:15,028 --> 00:20:16,098
that's been here
his whole life.

496
00:20:16,262 --> 00:20:18,139
[Munday] I want to say
I didn't like him.

497
00:20:18,297 --> 00:20:19,833
The first time I meet Jon,
he's driving

498
00:20:19,999 --> 00:20:23,139
this black Mercedes, two-door,
that's got drug dealer

499
00:20:23,302 --> 00:20:24,144
written all over it.

500
00:20:24,304 --> 00:20:26,341
He just looked like
somebody that I don't want

501
00:20:26,506 --> 00:20:28,144
to have anything
to do with.

502
00:20:28,308 --> 00:20:29,480
I think he was okay.

503
00:20:29,642 --> 00:20:31,849
He had a big race boat.
He was involved in racing.

504
00:20:32,011 --> 00:20:33,149
Do you remember
the show MacGyver?

505
00:20:33,313 --> 00:20:34,417
That's this guy.

506
00:20:34,547 --> 00:20:36,424
He could do stuff
that just was incredible.

507
00:20:36,549 --> 00:20:38,790
And Max had me
working with these guys,

508
00:20:38,918 --> 00:20:40,158
and he sent me to Colombia.

509
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,027
[man 1] Medellin, Colombia.

510
00:20:42,188 --> 00:20:44,725
Right now there is little
or no cocaine enforcement

511
00:20:44,891 --> 00:20:45,801
activity here.

512
00:20:45,925 --> 00:20:48,496
[man 2] This city only has
a population of about 50,000,

513
00:20:48,661 --> 00:20:49,503
yet there are about

514
00:20:49,662 --> 00:20:51,664
50 airplanes
parked at this airport.

515
00:20:51,831 --> 00:20:54,038
[man 1] The dealers control
much of the countryside.

516
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:57,841
[man 3] This town is completely
dedicated to narcotics.

517
00:20:58,004 --> 00:20:59,449
Rafa would introduce me
to the people

518
00:20:59,572 --> 00:21:00,550
he was working with.

519
00:21:00,707 --> 00:21:01,685
We met, you might say,

520
00:21:01,841 --> 00:21:05,345
the elite of the drug business
from Colombia.

521
00:21:05,511 --> 00:21:06,888
And it would be the Ochoas--

522
00:21:07,046 --> 00:21:08,753
[man] Here lives
a man believed to be

523
00:21:08,915 --> 00:21:10,292
one of the most
powerful cocaine

524
00:21:10,416 --> 00:21:11,486
traffickers in the world:

525
00:21:11,617 --> 00:21:13,028
Fabio Ochoa.

526
00:21:13,186 --> 00:21:14,221
This is his ranch,

527
00:21:14,387 --> 00:21:15,923
and he is treated
as a hero here.

528
00:21:16,089 --> 00:21:17,693
They were a huge
name in Colombia.

529
00:21:17,857 --> 00:21:19,461
There was no secret
about them.

530
00:21:20,026 --> 00:21:22,905
[man 1] Fabio Ochoa is considered
by many as a godfather

531
00:21:23,062 --> 00:21:24,063
of the business.

532
00:21:24,230 --> 00:21:26,676
[man 2] Some intelligence officials
have charged that

533
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:28,676
you and the members
of your family

534
00:21:28,801 --> 00:21:31,941
are the biggest cocaine
traffickers in the world.

535
00:21:35,541 --> 00:21:37,782
I know nothing of lies
being told.

536
00:21:37,944 --> 00:21:39,685
This doesn't interest me.

537
00:21:39,812 --> 00:21:42,554
I am well known by all the
horse breeders in the world.

538
00:21:42,715 --> 00:21:44,922
My life has been honorable,
and I can tip my hat.

539
00:21:46,552 --> 00:21:47,553
[Munday] This was Pablo Escobar.

540
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:50,758
[man] Mr. Escobar by any measure,
has to be considered

541
00:21:50,923 --> 00:21:53,563
the John Dillinger of the
cocaine trade in Colombia.

542
00:21:53,726 --> 00:21:54,932
[Munday] And this is Carlos Lehder.

543
00:21:55,094 --> 00:21:56,698
[man 1] Carlos Lehder is wanted

544
00:21:56,829 --> 00:21:58,570
by the U.S. authorities
for drug trafficking.

545
00:21:58,731 --> 00:22:01,405
[man 2] He stated cocaine
was the atomic bomb

546
00:22:01,567 --> 00:22:03,205
and he was going
to drop it on America.

547
00:22:03,369 --> 00:22:05,440
[man 3] The cocaine traffickers
have more power and money

548
00:22:05,605 --> 00:22:06,606
than the government.

549
00:22:06,773 --> 00:22:08,343
You make it sound like
they had an office

550
00:22:08,474 --> 00:22:11,080
the size of this with computers
and they got 40 secretaries.

551
00:22:11,244 --> 00:22:12,655
It's just a bunch of bums
down there.

552
00:22:12,812 --> 00:22:14,985
[Roberts] Most of these Colombians
came from really

553
00:22:15,148 --> 00:22:18,357
poor, poor families.
And when everybody in this country

554
00:22:18,484 --> 00:22:20,725
got into cocaine, it was
just like they struck gold.

555
00:22:20,853 --> 00:22:24,460
The Beverly Hillbillies,
that's basically what it was.

556
00:22:24,624 --> 00:22:26,934
The Colombians have farms,
fincas they call them,

557
00:22:27,093 --> 00:22:29,437
just filled with cocaine down there,

558
00:22:29,595 --> 00:22:30,938
because they just
kept producing it.

559
00:22:31,097 --> 00:22:32,838
They call this the
Valley of Orchids.

560
00:22:32,999 --> 00:22:35,070
Flowers are a principal export.

561
00:22:35,234 --> 00:22:36,212
So is cocaine.

562
00:22:36,335 --> 00:22:38,611
More than 20 tons a year.

563
00:22:38,771 --> 00:22:41,445
For this valley is the cocaine
capital of the world.

564
00:22:41,607 --> 00:22:43,086
[Roberts]
And it was a whole process.

565
00:22:43,242 --> 00:22:44,744
It was like
a factory working.

566
00:22:44,877 --> 00:22:46,754
Campesinos - peasant farmers -

567
00:22:46,879 --> 00:22:49,257
support their families
by processing the leaves

568
00:22:49,415 --> 00:22:50,621
into coca paste.

569
00:22:50,783 --> 00:22:52,126
It was a matter of survival.

570
00:22:52,285 --> 00:22:53,389
I mean, there were
no other crops

571
00:22:53,519 --> 00:22:55,999
that would grow
in that environment,

572
00:22:56,155 --> 00:22:57,862
and at that altitude
in those mountains.

573
00:22:58,024 --> 00:23:00,766
[man 1] The farmer lives off
the coca plant,

574
00:23:00,893 --> 00:23:03,931
and without it,
there is no point in living.

575
00:23:04,063 --> 00:23:06,942
[man 2] Without coca,
we would have to die.

576
00:23:07,066 --> 00:23:09,637
[man 3] The coca paste is then
taken to processing labs

577
00:23:09,802 --> 00:23:11,281
to be made into cocaine.

578
00:23:11,437 --> 00:23:13,144
One popular route
is this one,

579
00:23:13,306 --> 00:23:14,512
along the Amazon River.

580
00:23:14,674 --> 00:23:17,314
And in going down
the river in a longboat,

581
00:23:17,477 --> 00:23:19,047
the guys in the boat
would stand up,

582
00:23:19,312 --> 00:23:21,519
and they would
hold the bags of cocaine,

583
00:23:21,681 --> 00:23:24,628
and I remember them
shouting, "Coca-roca."

584
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:26,525
And showing it off
right there.

585
00:23:26,686 --> 00:23:27,892
This is what we have.

586
00:23:28,054 --> 00:23:29,727
[man] There are just
too many coca fields,

587
00:23:29,889 --> 00:23:32,028
too much money,
and too many traffickers.

588
00:23:32,191 --> 00:23:35,172
[Munday] At first I thought
it was all their stuff.

589
00:23:35,328 --> 00:23:37,865
But once you get to the point
where you're unpackaging it,

590
00:23:38,030 --> 00:23:39,441
they're all marked different.

591
00:23:39,565 --> 00:23:40,805
It didn't all belong
to somebody.

592
00:23:40,933 --> 00:23:42,207
Maybe 50 belonged
to this guy,

593
00:23:42,368 --> 00:23:44,314
10 to that guy,
5 to this guy.

594
00:23:44,470 --> 00:23:46,711
They would all pool
their stuff and send it up.

595
00:23:46,873 --> 00:23:47,874
Going down
the freight yard,

596
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:49,542
when you get the train full,
then you leave, you know.

597
00:23:49,709 --> 00:23:51,746
That's what they were doing.

598
00:23:51,911 --> 00:23:54,721
[man] The ships and planes that
smuggle it in come to Miami,

599
00:23:54,881 --> 00:23:55,916
and then the coke spreads

600
00:23:56,082 --> 00:23:57,993
all over
the Eastern United States.

601
00:23:59,585 --> 00:24:00,825
[Munday] We bought
some property in Lakeland,

602
00:24:00,953 --> 00:24:03,399
built two runways there,
put up a couple of barns

603
00:24:03,556 --> 00:24:05,900
that were really hangars.
They looked like barns,

604
00:24:06,058 --> 00:24:07,696
but when you'd open up
the hayloft door,

605
00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:09,203
you would see that
it was shaped

606
00:24:09,362 --> 00:24:11,205
to the tail
of an airplane door.

607
00:24:11,364 --> 00:24:14,072
I would use a five, six,
eight-year-old family car.

608
00:24:14,233 --> 00:24:15,712
[Roberts] And we would
load 300 pieces.

609
00:24:15,868 --> 00:24:17,211
And we would put
air shocks on the car,

610
00:24:17,370 --> 00:24:19,077
so that the car wouldn't
fall to the ground.

611
00:24:19,238 --> 00:24:21,775
And we would use a tow truck
to tow the vehicle back.

612
00:24:21,941 --> 00:24:23,477
[Roberts] They would bring
them into Miami.

613
00:24:23,609 --> 00:24:26,783
I personally liked to go
when there was a big moon up.

614
00:24:26,946 --> 00:24:27,924
I call them
the "Smuggler's Moon."

615
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:30,856
The moon sitting right there,
and it's real big,

616
00:24:30,983 --> 00:24:32,587
because we landed
with no lights.

617
00:24:32,752 --> 00:24:34,595
There was a night, looking
at an alternate,

618
00:24:34,754 --> 00:24:37,963
where I watched some guys
come in off Route 27.

619
00:24:38,124 --> 00:24:39,728
They didn't know I'm there.

620
00:24:39,892 --> 00:24:41,394
I'm listening
to everything they say.

621
00:24:41,561 --> 00:24:43,268
I have night scopes
and goggles. I'm watching,

622
00:24:43,429 --> 00:24:44,499
and I could have been
the man to seize them.

623
00:24:44,630 --> 00:24:47,509
They came in, and there
was a ball of fire.

624
00:24:47,633 --> 00:24:48,976
I thought it was
like an atomic bomb.

625
00:24:49,135 --> 00:24:50,113
I've never seen a flash.

626
00:24:50,269 --> 00:24:52,510
If you took a flash camera,
went right up to your face

627
00:24:52,638 --> 00:24:54,618
and went click, it would
not have been as bright.

628
00:24:54,774 --> 00:24:57,050
It blinded me
because the nights go bloons.

629
00:24:57,176 --> 00:24:58,985
And the guy's on the radio,
"Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

630
00:24:59,145 --> 00:25:00,385
We're dying, we're dead,"
and then boom!

631
00:25:00,613 --> 00:25:02,456
Right in front of me, [MIMICS PLANE]
it was one of these things.

632
00:25:02,615 --> 00:25:03,616
It was an avo.

633
00:25:03,783 --> 00:25:05,922
They didn't know
they'd put the power wire up

634
00:25:06,085 --> 00:25:07,257
since the last time
they'd been out there.

635
00:25:07,420 --> 00:25:08,455
He hit it
with the top of the nose,

636
00:25:08,621 --> 00:25:09,531
went over
the top of the airplane,

637
00:25:09,655 --> 00:25:12,693
took all the antennas off
and chopped the tail right off.

638
00:25:12,825 --> 00:25:15,271
And his friends
all hauled ass.

639
00:25:15,428 --> 00:25:17,271
And so did he,
and left a little thing

640
00:25:17,430 --> 00:25:18,966
in the plane that I took.

641
00:25:19,131 --> 00:25:20,542
A whole lot
of little things.

642
00:25:20,666 --> 00:25:22,407
It was a rather
worthwhile night,

643
00:25:22,568 --> 00:25:23,774
for all I did was go out
there to look

644
00:25:23,936 --> 00:25:25,108
for an alternate.

645
00:25:25,271 --> 00:25:27,251
[Roberts] Mickey's operation
was a very sound,

646
00:25:27,406 --> 00:25:29,613
very good operation,
although it was limited.

647
00:25:29,775 --> 00:25:30,810
[Munday] They wanted us
to go more often.

648
00:25:30,977 --> 00:25:33,082
Bigger airplane
or something.

649
00:25:33,212 --> 00:25:35,158
And that's when we purchased
a Cessna Conquest.

650
00:25:35,314 --> 00:25:37,920
We paid $980,000 for it.

651
00:25:38,050 --> 00:25:39,961
In cash.

652
00:25:40,119 --> 00:25:41,962
How do you like that?
You try that one today.

653
00:25:42,121 --> 00:25:44,658
We'd made one trip with it.

654
00:25:44,824 --> 00:25:46,929
[Roberts] Sometimes you just
get bored, I guess.

655
00:25:47,059 --> 00:25:49,005
In that particular trip,
I went up there,

656
00:25:49,161 --> 00:25:50,936
not to unload it
or put it on the truck.

657
00:25:51,063 --> 00:25:51,939
We were just hanging out.

658
00:25:52,064 --> 00:25:53,668
[Munday] The pilot knew he
was going to have a problem

659
00:25:53,833 --> 00:25:55,176
when he could see
the lights out

660
00:25:55,334 --> 00:25:57,314
of Tampa on the horizon,

661
00:25:57,470 --> 00:25:59,040
which meant
he was too high.

662
00:25:59,205 --> 00:26:00,809
If he could see
the lights of Tampa,

663
00:26:00,973 --> 00:26:03,317
that meant that they could
see him with radar.

664
00:26:03,476 --> 00:26:04,477
[Roberts]
Next thing I know, wham.

665
00:26:04,643 --> 00:26:07,522
These cars start
flying by. Police cars.

666
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:08,954
Here comes a chase plane.

667
00:26:09,081 --> 00:26:10,822
[Munday] First they were chasing
him with the military airplanes.

668
00:26:10,983 --> 00:26:12,963
Here come my guys,
who had the cars up there,

669
00:26:13,085 --> 00:26:15,065
flying into the restaurant,
"What's up, what's up?"

670
00:26:15,221 --> 00:26:16,962
"We got to get out of here,
we got to get out of here."

671
00:26:17,089 --> 00:26:19,330
[Munday] And the military
realized that it wasn't a threat,

672
00:26:19,492 --> 00:26:21,233
and by then they'd called in

673
00:26:21,393 --> 00:26:22,463
the U.S. Customs.

674
00:26:22,628 --> 00:26:24,471
[Roberts] Cops are everywhere,
all over this stuff.

675
00:26:24,630 --> 00:26:27,804
Everybody is going
to go out the door.

676
00:26:27,933 --> 00:26:29,606
You don't throw
nothing away.

677
00:26:29,735 --> 00:26:31,612
You throw everything away.

678
00:26:31,737 --> 00:26:33,045
First the co-pilot
would go out.

679
00:26:33,205 --> 00:26:35,811
Fifteen, 20 minutes later,
the pilot would go out

680
00:26:35,941 --> 00:26:38,080
and would leave
the plane on autopilot

681
00:26:38,244 --> 00:26:40,315
and give it
to the Bermuda Triangle.

682
00:26:40,479 --> 00:26:44,222
And nobody believed that
I lost the load, and I said,

683
00:26:44,383 --> 00:26:47,091
"I lost it, man. These guys
will tell you I lost it."

684
00:26:47,253 --> 00:26:48,698
And he said, "Well,
why isn't it in the paper?

685
00:26:48,854 --> 00:26:49,696
Show us the article
in the paper."

686
00:26:49,855 --> 00:26:50,697
You know what I mean?

687
00:26:50,856 --> 00:26:52,233
When it first happened,
of course, they don't.

688
00:26:52,391 --> 00:26:53,495
There's nothing
in the newspaper.

689
00:26:53,659 --> 00:26:55,002
And you needed
to bring them proof,

690
00:26:55,127 --> 00:26:56,105
but I couldn't prove it.

691
00:26:56,262 --> 00:26:58,105
I had no way to prove it.

692
00:26:58,264 --> 00:27:00,175
Man, they came flying
to my house

693
00:27:00,299 --> 00:27:02,506
with machine guns
and cruise killers.

694
00:27:02,668 --> 00:27:05,012
[Mooney] I remember my brother
and I were out on the porch,

695
00:27:05,137 --> 00:27:06,514
and these two guys
drove up.

696
00:27:06,672 --> 00:27:08,845
Rafa came. They get out of
the car with guns.

697
00:27:08,974 --> 00:27:10,851
[Roberts] "You fucked us.
You took our load."

698
00:27:10,976 --> 00:27:12,421
And of course me,
I go right over,

699
00:27:12,578 --> 00:27:14,353
get in his face
and start screaming,

700
00:27:14,513 --> 00:27:15,685
"Get off my property,
blah, blah, blah."

701
00:27:15,848 --> 00:27:17,850
Colombians were actually
afraid of this woman.

702
00:27:17,983 --> 00:27:19,860
[Mooney] Next thing I know,
Jon comes out of the house,

703
00:27:19,985 --> 00:27:21,259
my brother comes out
of the house,

704
00:27:21,420 --> 00:27:22,899
and they both have
weapons drawn.

705
00:27:23,055 --> 00:27:25,092
And standing there
with a laser shotgun and--

706
00:27:25,257 --> 00:27:26,361
She didn't give
a shit who came.

707
00:27:26,525 --> 00:27:27,902
Rafa could bring
six, seven guys.

708
00:27:28,060 --> 00:27:30,870
And she was a big girl
and Rafa was only like 5'5",

709
00:27:30,997 --> 00:27:32,271
and she was
looking down at him,

710
00:27:32,431 --> 00:27:33,375
screaming and screaming.

711
00:27:33,532 --> 00:27:34,875
Of course,
there I am, screaming.

712
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,240
"You ain't coming
in my house today."

713
00:27:36,402 --> 00:27:37,244
It looked like
they were going to have

714
00:27:37,403 --> 00:27:38,279
a gun battle right there.

715
00:27:38,437 --> 00:27:39,541
"What are you, crazy?

716
00:27:39,705 --> 00:27:41,685
For this amount,
why would I take your load?"

717
00:27:41,807 --> 00:27:43,980
I could have ripped them off,
but I didn't do it.

718
00:27:44,143 --> 00:27:46,248
"Are you nuts?
I'm working tomorrow.

719
00:27:46,412 --> 00:27:47,686
I'm doing 1,000 tomorrow.

720
00:27:47,813 --> 00:27:49,121
Why wouldn't
I take your 1,000?"

721
00:27:49,281 --> 00:27:51,283
Five hundred kilos compared to
what I'm bringing every week.

722
00:27:51,450 --> 00:27:52,793
It just wasn't worth it.

723
00:27:52,952 --> 00:27:54,761
[Munday] it wasn't until the next day,
and then I started reading

724
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:55,955
about all the stuff being found.

725
00:27:56,121 --> 00:27:57,395
[Roberts] And that's the proof
with the paper,

726
00:27:57,556 --> 00:27:59,001
because when you hand them
the article,

727
00:27:59,158 --> 00:28:01,570
"480 kilos Busted
in Yeehaw Junction."

728
00:28:01,727 --> 00:28:04,640
And of course they realized
that we weren't stealing it.

729
00:28:04,797 --> 00:28:06,435
Okay, here's my 480 kilos.

730
00:28:06,599 --> 00:28:07,907
We have to get rid of it.

731
00:28:08,033 --> 00:28:09,774
"It's not our problem,
it's your problem."

732
00:28:09,935 --> 00:28:11,642
But without the paper
you had no proof.

733
00:28:11,804 --> 00:28:12,612
Unfortunately,

734
00:28:12,771 --> 00:28:14,409
we lost a
$1 million airplane

735
00:28:14,573 --> 00:28:15,950
and they lost
whatever it cost them

736
00:28:16,108 --> 00:28:18,418
for their part,
so they write it off.

737
00:28:18,577 --> 00:28:20,454
And we wrote it off too.

738
00:28:20,613 --> 00:28:22,957
[Roberts] Rafa was crazy
like that, and I guess it was

739
00:28:23,115 --> 00:28:25,459
because he did so much coke
he would get paranoid.

740
00:28:25,618 --> 00:28:28,963
He was just a little guy
that was kind of crazy,

741
00:28:29,121 --> 00:28:31,465
and you had to be
a little leery of him

742
00:28:31,624 --> 00:28:32,500
because he would get high.

743
00:28:32,658 --> 00:28:33,728
He'd smoke the shit.

744
00:28:34,059 --> 00:28:37,336
He would take like half of
the tobacco of the cigarette,

745
00:28:37,496 --> 00:28:38,600
put cocaine in it,

746
00:28:38,764 --> 00:28:41,836
a little tobacco back in,
and smoke it.

747
00:28:42,001 --> 00:28:44,845
One time, a trip
was on for Saturday,

748
00:28:45,004 --> 00:28:46,745
and some kind of
problem had come up

749
00:28:46,872 --> 00:28:48,351
and I needed one more day.

750
00:28:48,507 --> 00:28:50,851
Max was out of town,
so I get to Max's house,

751
00:28:51,010 --> 00:28:52,614
and I go on into
the dining room.

752
00:28:52,778 --> 00:28:56,191
Rafa is there, sitting at the
head of the dining room table.

753
00:28:56,348 --> 00:28:59,488
I thought it was marijuana,
but it turned out not to be.

754
00:28:59,652 --> 00:29:01,632
A circle about this big
and about that high.

755
00:29:01,787 --> 00:29:02,993
And he's using
like a credit card

756
00:29:03,155 --> 00:29:06,625
or something
to keep it in shape.

757
00:29:06,792 --> 00:29:10,137
What it is is tobacco
from a cigarette.

758
00:29:10,262 --> 00:29:11,969
There has been
so many cigarettes

759
00:29:12,097 --> 00:29:15,374
that he actually
has a pile of tobacco this big.

760
00:29:15,534 --> 00:29:17,241
And he's had that
much to smoke

761
00:29:17,403 --> 00:29:20,009
that there's that much tobacco.

762
00:29:20,172 --> 00:29:21,708
And I'm going, whoa!

763
00:29:21,874 --> 00:29:25,014
And he's like, drooling.
And the people

764
00:29:25,177 --> 00:29:27,020
there are all scared
to death of him,

765
00:29:27,179 --> 00:29:28,783
because he could say
something and somebody

766
00:29:28,914 --> 00:29:30,791
would be history, and I go,

767
00:29:30,916 --> 00:29:33,021
and I go...
And I don't speak Spanish,

768
00:29:33,185 --> 00:29:34,664
and I've got to try
to tell this guy

769
00:29:34,820 --> 00:29:37,528
who was higher than a kite,
that we needed one more day.

770
00:29:37,690 --> 00:29:39,533
I ended up having
to get Max's son,

771
00:29:39,692 --> 00:29:40,670
which I really
didn't want to do,

772
00:29:40,826 --> 00:29:42,669
because the kid was only like,
14 years old,

773
00:29:42,828 --> 00:29:45,001
to translate for me,
and then make sure that

774
00:29:45,130 --> 00:29:47,542
somebody there would call,
because I don't want to send

775
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:50,010
my plane the next day
and there's nobody there.

776
00:29:50,135 --> 00:29:51,512
But he was
in one of his binges.

777
00:29:51,670 --> 00:29:53,809
And those who knew
had to be afraid of him.

778
00:29:53,939 --> 00:29:57,386
It's amazing. Here was a guy
who made so much money...

779
00:29:57,543 --> 00:30:00,752
Rafa really controlled
almost every kilo of coke

780
00:30:00,913 --> 00:30:01,823
that came into this country

781
00:30:01,947 --> 00:30:03,221
through the people
from Medellin.

782
00:30:03,382 --> 00:30:04,918
There was nobody
higher than him

783
00:30:05,084 --> 00:30:06,586
for the Medellin Cartel
in this country.

784
00:30:06,752 --> 00:30:09,096
He was a little Napoleon.

785
00:30:09,254 --> 00:30:11,063
I often wondered
how much money somebody

786
00:30:11,223 --> 00:30:14,102
who had been fairly sharp
could have possibly made,

787
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:16,467
instead of some guy
who was a drug addict.

788
00:30:18,497 --> 00:30:20,568
Mickey then started
to do air drops.

789
00:30:20,733 --> 00:30:23,009
I built me a small boat
factory to play with,

790
00:30:23,135 --> 00:30:26,378
and we decided to do
Colombia up to the Bahamas,

791
00:30:26,505 --> 00:30:28,007
air drop it to boats.

792
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:30,381
[Roberts] And they had beacons
that they would drop,

793
00:30:30,509 --> 00:30:33,456
and they would be able to know
exactly where the load was,

794
00:30:33,612 --> 00:30:34,886
because there would
be a frequency

795
00:30:35,047 --> 00:30:37,254
that would send back
to where it was.

796
00:30:37,416 --> 00:30:40,488
The middle console
would open up.

797
00:30:40,653 --> 00:30:42,758
They'd put holes
in the middle of the boat,

798
00:30:42,921 --> 00:30:44,958
and you would fill them up.

799
00:30:45,124 --> 00:30:47,263
[Munday] And then
bring it in with boats.

800
00:30:47,426 --> 00:30:50,032
Sometimes I would run what
we call the front door.

801
00:30:50,162 --> 00:30:52,403
The front door would be
the entrance at Haulover.

802
00:30:52,531 --> 00:30:53,874
We would call it a front door.

803
00:30:53,999 --> 00:30:55,137
You can't say, "Why are
you coming in Haulover?

804
00:30:55,301 --> 00:30:56,905
We say, "You're coming
in the front door."

805
00:30:57,069 --> 00:30:58,742
It's a code of sorts.

806
00:30:58,904 --> 00:31:01,248
At the Haulover Inlet,
I rented an apartment

807
00:31:01,373 --> 00:31:02,750
on the 12th floor
in the north-east corner

808
00:31:02,908 --> 00:31:03,784
called the Harbour House,

809
00:31:03,942 --> 00:31:07,151
which has a spectacular view
of the inlet.

810
00:31:07,313 --> 00:31:10,658
And I put a young lady there,
and I paid her to live there,

811
00:31:10,816 --> 00:31:14,161
paid for the apartment.
And whenever we did a trip...

812
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:16,300
She has an unbelievable
set of binoculars,

813
00:31:16,455 --> 00:31:18,162
and of course she has a radio.

814
00:31:18,324 --> 00:31:19,667
When you got inside
the Haulover,

815
00:31:19,825 --> 00:31:21,634
there was another boat.
And the guy in that

816
00:31:21,794 --> 00:31:24,297
was a policeman
that I grew up with,

817
00:31:24,463 --> 00:31:26,306
so he could listen
to the police radios too.

818
00:31:26,465 --> 00:31:28,172
But I told him, I said,
"Take your family, go fishing,

819
00:31:28,334 --> 00:31:29,642
have a good time.

820
00:31:29,802 --> 00:31:31,145
People get used
to seeing you there,

821
00:31:31,303 --> 00:31:32,805
just like a sand bar
that you can go swimming on.

822
00:31:32,971 --> 00:31:33,813
It's a whole lot of fun."

823
00:31:33,973 --> 00:31:35,384
And he's of course looking.

824
00:31:35,541 --> 00:31:36,952
He'd go north
on the inter-coastal.

825
00:31:37,109 --> 00:31:38,679
About half way
up around the corner

826
00:31:38,844 --> 00:31:40,323
there'd be another
little boat fishing there.

827
00:31:40,479 --> 00:31:41,219
He was the burner.

828
00:31:41,380 --> 00:31:45,089
If there was ever a problem,
they would burn the boat.

829
00:31:45,217 --> 00:31:46,958
And everybody would call and say

830
00:31:47,119 --> 00:31:48,655
there was children in the water.

831
00:31:48,821 --> 00:31:51,563
The police have this thing...
Something like that.

832
00:31:51,724 --> 00:31:53,931
They drop everything,
and this is an emergency.

833
00:31:54,059 --> 00:31:55,197
And that would suck anything

834
00:31:55,361 --> 00:31:56,840
if we thought
there was a problem.

835
00:31:56,995 --> 00:31:58,201
Fortunately, I never
had to use this guy.

836
00:31:58,363 --> 00:31:59,398
I never had a problem.

837
00:31:59,565 --> 00:32:01,101
From there, we were going up

838
00:32:01,233 --> 00:32:02,678
to the entrance
to Maule Lake Marina,

839
00:32:02,835 --> 00:32:04,314
which is about a quarter mile
north of there.

840
00:32:04,436 --> 00:32:06,040
On the corner, there was
another friend of mine

841
00:32:06,205 --> 00:32:08,048
who had a tire store.

842
00:32:08,207 --> 00:32:09,345
He's sitting there fishing.

843
00:32:09,508 --> 00:32:11,715
So he can see up and down
the inter-coastal,

844
00:32:11,877 --> 00:32:14,858
and on the canal going back
into Maule Lake Marina.

845
00:32:15,014 --> 00:32:17,153
I paid these guys.
"Go fishing, have a good time."

846
00:32:17,282 --> 00:32:19,353
When they got
into Maule Lake Marina,

847
00:32:19,518 --> 00:32:22,590
I had a sport fishing boat
that I'd taken in on trade.

848
00:32:22,755 --> 00:32:24,996
I had several slips
that I rented.

849
00:32:25,157 --> 00:32:27,000
I parked the boat there,
and I or somebody

850
00:32:27,159 --> 00:32:28,433
would spend the night
and watch the boat.

851
00:32:28,594 --> 00:32:29,868
If nobody bothered the boat,

852
00:32:30,029 --> 00:32:32,373
then the next day
my tow truck would show up,

853
00:32:32,531 --> 00:32:34,272
with a work order,
and a trailer.

854
00:32:34,433 --> 00:32:36,003
He load the boat on the trailer,

855
00:32:36,168 --> 00:32:37,841
and he would take it
to the warehouse.

856
00:32:38,003 --> 00:32:40,506
The boat would go in there,
because I owned the warehouse,

857
00:32:40,639 --> 00:32:42,346
the warehouse, the warehouse,
the warehouse.

858
00:32:42,474 --> 00:32:44,385
I didn't have to worry
about anybody seeing me,

859
00:32:44,610 --> 00:32:46,612
because I owned it all.

860
00:32:46,779 --> 00:32:47,723
And then we would go
in the back,

861
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:49,154
open up the compartment,

862
00:32:49,281 --> 00:32:51,158
and load the stuff
into the cars.

863
00:32:51,283 --> 00:32:54,264
I spent money.
Nobody else would do this.

864
00:32:54,420 --> 00:32:56,525
These guys came in, and they
would go to a boat rent,

865
00:32:56,655 --> 00:32:57,725
because it didn't
cost them nothing,

866
00:32:57,890 --> 00:32:59,631
and then they'd be
caught at the boat rent.

867
00:32:59,792 --> 00:33:01,100
What are you doing?
Where are you coming from?

868
00:33:01,260 --> 00:33:03,171
"You know, well,
I'm just out fishing."

869
00:33:03,295 --> 00:33:05,741
And they'd have
a bottle of Coca-Cola

870
00:33:05,898 --> 00:33:08,310
that said, "bottled in Nassau."
I mean, dumb.

871
00:33:09,134 --> 00:33:11,011
To make sure
that there were no dogs,

872
00:33:11,136 --> 00:33:13,878
I would take some
marijuana or some cocaine,

873
00:33:14,039 --> 00:33:16,883
and I would put it in the
blender with a little alcohol

874
00:33:17,042 --> 00:33:18,646
and just leave
the blender on for an hour,

875
00:33:18,811 --> 00:33:20,256
until there was nothing.

876
00:33:20,412 --> 00:33:21,914
I would wear out
blenders doing this.

877
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:24,287
And then I would mix it
with a little bit of kerosene

878
00:33:24,449 --> 00:33:26,190
and put it in one of those spray

879
00:33:26,318 --> 00:33:28,491
like weed bottles
or bug bottles.

880
00:33:28,654 --> 00:33:30,895
The idea was to spray like,
the concrete thing

881
00:33:31,056 --> 00:33:32,126
around the telephone pole,

882
00:33:32,291 --> 00:33:34,293
or the big tire that was
on the tow motor.

883
00:33:34,459 --> 00:33:36,564
Things where,
if the dog alerted to it,

884
00:33:36,695 --> 00:33:38,265
there's no way
there could be any drugs.

885
00:33:38,430 --> 00:33:40,273
The dog would go alert to a tree

886
00:33:40,432 --> 00:33:42,776
or to an old tire
that's sitting there.

887
00:33:42,935 --> 00:33:48,078
I tried to tell Max every dollar
bill that ever came to Colombia,

888
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:49,275
they should have sprayed it,

889
00:33:49,441 --> 00:33:52,820
so that every piece of money
had cocaine on it.

890
00:33:52,978 --> 00:33:54,150
Every airplane
that came down there,

891
00:33:54,313 --> 00:33:56,657
every piece of freight that
went out and needs to go in,

892
00:33:56,815 --> 00:33:59,523
they hire somebody
to supposedly spray for bugs.

893
00:33:59,685 --> 00:34:02,291
So everything that came out
of Colombia would alert,

894
00:34:02,454 --> 00:34:04,525
and that would be
the end of the dogs.

895
00:34:05,991 --> 00:34:07,937
And the drugs
were everywhere.

896
00:34:08,093 --> 00:34:10,596
[man] Millions of Americans
use the illicit drugs.

897
00:34:10,729 --> 00:34:12,606
[Roberts] Everybody started
using cocaine.

898
00:34:12,731 --> 00:34:14,108
Cocaine was the in thing
back then.

899
00:34:14,266 --> 00:34:15,609
It was a chichi thing to do.

900
00:34:15,734 --> 00:34:17,111
[man 1] It was really done.

901
00:34:17,269 --> 00:34:21,081
[man 2] Every day about 5,000
take their first dose or toot.

902
00:34:21,206 --> 00:34:22,708
As many as five million snort,

903
00:34:22,875 --> 00:34:25,253
shoot or smoke cocaine
every month.

904
00:34:25,377 --> 00:34:27,118
[man 4] The American public thinks
it's neat.

905
00:34:27,279 --> 00:34:28,815
[man 5] It's a very, very
seductive drug.

906
00:34:28,981 --> 00:34:30,119
It's almost like a woman.

907
00:34:30,282 --> 00:34:33,320
It is probably the closest thing
one can have to an orgasm.

908
00:34:33,485 --> 00:34:34,793
[man 1] It's exciting.

909
00:34:34,953 --> 00:34:37,297
You can just stand still
and go 90 mph.

910
00:34:37,422 --> 00:34:39,493
[man 2] We're analyzing
cocaine samples now

911
00:34:39,658 --> 00:34:41,831
that were purchased
for $50 to $100 per gram

912
00:34:41,994 --> 00:34:43,632
that are 95% pure.

913
00:34:43,762 --> 00:34:44,832
The death rate
in Dade County at about

914
00:34:44,997 --> 00:34:47,136
two per week from cocaine.

915
00:34:47,299 --> 00:34:49,973
[man 3] Each month brings new efforts
to fight the white line fever

916
00:34:50,135 --> 00:34:53,639
that spread from Miami
to Denver to San Francisco.

917
00:34:53,772 --> 00:34:56,685
[man 4] Cocaine seizures
in Florida are up 700%--

918
00:34:56,842 --> 00:34:58,583
--one of the biggest
and most controversial

919
00:34:58,744 --> 00:35:01,020
drug investigations
ever in South Florida.

920
00:35:01,180 --> 00:35:03,387
[woman] Customs seized
an Avianca 747

921
00:35:03,549 --> 00:35:05,290
at dawn
at Miami International.

922
00:35:05,417 --> 00:35:08,398
The daily flight, having
just arrived from Bogota.

923
00:35:08,554 --> 00:35:11,865
2,500 pounds of cocaine
hidden in cut flowers.

924
00:35:12,024 --> 00:35:13,901
[man 1] We went from having cases

925
00:35:14,059 --> 00:35:16,164
of a kilo
or two kilos of cocaine,

926
00:35:16,328 --> 00:35:19,537
to 1,000 kilos,
which is a ton of cocaine,

927
00:35:19,698 --> 00:35:23,510
to 10,000 kilos,
which is 10 tons of cocaine.

928
00:35:23,635 --> 00:35:27,173
[man 2] There were boxes of it.
3,600 pounds of cocaine.

929
00:35:27,339 --> 00:35:28,784
Drug enforcement agents
said it was worth

930
00:35:28,941 --> 00:35:31,319
$950 million on the street.

931
00:35:31,443 --> 00:35:33,787
The shipment was bound
from Medellin, Colombia,

932
00:35:33,946 --> 00:35:35,584
the cocaine export
capital of the world.

933
00:35:35,748 --> 00:35:38,194
Shipped aboard this
Tampa Colombia Airlines jet.

934
00:35:38,350 --> 00:35:40,887
Customs agents were called
to the scene, shotguns ready,

935
00:35:41,053 --> 00:35:42,430
fearing that
the cocaine smugglers

936
00:35:42,588 --> 00:35:44,693
might still try to take
the drugs by force.

937
00:35:44,823 --> 00:35:47,201
The regional commissioner of
customs, Robert Batard, said,

938
00:35:47,359 --> 00:35:49,066
"Somebody is going
to die for this."

939
00:35:49,228 --> 00:35:50,764
It is a big cocaine bust,

940
00:35:50,929 --> 00:35:53,170
certainly the biggest in the
history of the United States.

941
00:35:53,298 --> 00:35:57,610
Every case was bigger than
the last one, and a new record.

942
00:35:57,769 --> 00:35:59,749
[man] I remember the days
I'd bring into the office

943
00:35:59,905 --> 00:36:01,714
an ounce of cocaine,
and four or five agents

944
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:02,944
would gather around
the table and say,

945
00:36:03,108 --> 00:36:04,917
"Look how much dope
is in there."

946
00:36:05,077 --> 00:36:07,956
Right now, we seize
1,500 pounds, 2,000 pounds,

947
00:36:08,113 --> 00:36:09,820
and it's just one more case.

948
00:36:09,982 --> 00:36:14,590
[woman] The demand for cocaine
in the U.S. is seemingly insatiable.

949
00:36:19,258 --> 00:36:20,794
[Burstyn] When I first arrived here,

950
00:36:20,959 --> 00:36:24,133
we had businesses like
t-shirt shops on the beach,

951
00:36:24,296 --> 00:36:27,368
where you could buy suntan oil
or little stuffed alligators.

952
00:36:27,499 --> 00:36:29,843
Then suddenly, Mayor's Jewelers

953
00:36:30,002 --> 00:36:33,313
becomes the largest seller
of Rolexes on earth.

954
00:36:33,472 --> 00:36:35,247
[woman] The economy skyrocketed.

955
00:36:35,407 --> 00:36:37,614
[man] And that's very, very hard
to understand on any basis,

956
00:36:37,776 --> 00:36:40,757
except that you have this
enormous inflow from Colombia

957
00:36:40,879 --> 00:36:43,621
of drugs that are paid for and
wholesaled in the Miami area.

958
00:36:43,782 --> 00:36:45,227
[man 1] They call it dirty money,

959
00:36:45,350 --> 00:36:47,261
and there's plenty of it
in the drug business.

960
00:36:47,419 --> 00:36:49,831
[man 2] It's what that cocaine money
is buying besides drugs

961
00:36:49,988 --> 00:36:52,764
that is having the most
impact on South Florida.

962
00:36:52,891 --> 00:36:54,268
[Munday]
People went out and partied.

963
00:36:54,426 --> 00:36:57,635
[Burstyn] That spawned
a huge nightlife industry.

964
00:36:57,796 --> 00:36:58,968
Women wore
phenomenal clothes,

965
00:36:59,131 --> 00:37:00,872
and there were some
really awesome nightclubs.

966
00:37:01,033 --> 00:37:05,277
[Burstyn] With cocaine, you
have unlimited hours to party.

967
00:37:05,437 --> 00:37:08,111
So we had some
incredible nightclubs

968
00:37:08,273 --> 00:37:10,446
built inside hotels.

969
00:37:10,575 --> 00:37:13,454
The full service
48 hour package.

970
00:37:13,578 --> 00:37:15,353
[Roberts] The Jockey Club,
Turnberry,

971
00:37:15,514 --> 00:37:17,118
the Palm Bay Club,
the Cricket Club.

972
00:37:17,282 --> 00:37:19,888
[Burstyn] You'd walk into
the clubs and you'd see people

973
00:37:20,052 --> 00:37:23,898
with diamond rings, Rolexes,
multiple bottles of $500 wines

974
00:37:24,056 --> 00:37:25,729
and champagnes at the tables.

975
00:37:25,891 --> 00:37:27,632
We would be outrageous.
You know, who cared?

976
00:37:27,759 --> 00:37:28,635
Do you know what I mean?

977
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:29,670
Like, you do anything
you want to do.

978
00:37:29,828 --> 00:37:31,637
For example, if we
wanted to go to dinner,

979
00:37:31,763 --> 00:37:34,835
at that time The Forge
was the best restaurant here.

980
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,809
I used to play jokes,
like there'd be a guy

981
00:37:36,935 --> 00:37:38,141
at another the table.
And I'd see him drinking

982
00:37:38,303 --> 00:37:39,907
a bottle of champagne,
and maybe he didn't have Dom

983
00:37:40,072 --> 00:37:41,676
or maybe he had something else.

984
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:43,547
I'd send the most expensive
bottle of champagne,

985
00:37:43,709 --> 00:37:45,814
and tell the waiter, "Go bring
him this bottle of champagne."

986
00:37:45,944 --> 00:37:47,582
These guys would be
looking around like,

987
00:37:47,746 --> 00:37:49,191
"Where's the champagne
coming from?"

988
00:37:49,348 --> 00:37:50,827
And I'd do it to two or three
different tables.

989
00:37:50,949 --> 00:37:53,054
It was like, "Who cares?
It's $1,000 or something."

990
00:37:53,218 --> 00:37:55,198
And all these guys go like,
"What the hell's going on here?

991
00:37:55,354 --> 00:37:57,334
How is this guy up here
sending all this shit around?"

992
00:37:57,489 --> 00:37:59,366
But the best of all clubs
was definitely

993
00:37:59,524 --> 00:38:01,299
The Mutiny in Coconut Grove.

994
00:38:01,693 --> 00:38:05,698
It catered almost exclusively
to the drug traffic.

995
00:38:05,864 --> 00:38:07,172
If you were a prostitute,

996
00:38:07,332 --> 00:38:09,312
you were in prostitute heaven
at The Mutiny.

997
00:38:09,434 --> 00:38:11,778
There's nothing wrong
with chasing young women.

998
00:38:11,937 --> 00:38:13,575
[Burstyn] It was like sailors
coming into port,

999
00:38:13,739 --> 00:38:16,049
except instead
of just shore money,

1000
00:38:16,208 --> 00:38:18,779
these sailors had
$50,000, $100,000

1001
00:38:18,944 --> 00:38:20,355
in their pockets at all times.

1002
00:38:20,512 --> 00:38:22,185
They didn't believe
in credit cards.

1003
00:38:22,347 --> 00:38:24,088
They were turning
over 200 rooms

1004
00:38:24,249 --> 00:38:27,093
in 5-hour increments,
24 hours a day.

1005
00:38:27,252 --> 00:38:30,233
Multiple visits every day
by the Miami Police Department.

1006
00:38:30,389 --> 00:38:32,630
Of course, there weren't
a lot of arrests.

1007
00:38:32,791 --> 00:38:35,499
The most frightening part
of the cocaine...

1008
00:38:35,627 --> 00:38:36,571
A dilemma that we have...

1009
00:38:36,728 --> 00:38:39,072
The amount of that
illegal money.

1010
00:38:39,231 --> 00:38:40,938
Those billions of dollars in profits

1011
00:38:41,099 --> 00:38:44,945
that are being channeled
into legitimate businesses.

1012
00:38:45,103 --> 00:38:46,377
Civic leaders openly recognized

1013
00:38:46,538 --> 00:38:48,074
the community has a fix,
if you will,

1014
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:50,083
on the legitimate
goods and services

1015
00:38:50,242 --> 00:38:52,518
that cash from
the drug industry is buying.

1016
00:38:52,644 --> 00:38:54,521
Oh, yeah.
I love to go shopping.

1017
00:38:54,646 --> 00:38:57,126
The most shopping I did
was at Keeneland's.

1018
00:38:57,282 --> 00:38:58,386
I bought racehorses.

1019
00:38:58,550 --> 00:39:00,120
[Roberts] My biggest thing
was the horses.

1020
00:39:00,285 --> 00:39:02,629
[Mooney] Instead of dropping
$10,000, $20,000 shopping,

1021
00:39:02,788 --> 00:39:05,064
we dropped $100,000
on a horse.

1022
00:39:05,223 --> 00:39:07,760
[Roberts] I had 40, 50 horses
at a time. Racehorses.

1023
00:39:07,926 --> 00:39:09,530
You know what they cost
a month to feed?

1024
00:39:09,661 --> 00:39:12,267
$50,000 a mo-- Just for
the horses, just to feed them.

1025
00:39:12,431 --> 00:39:14,274
Forget about the guys
that took care of them.

1026
00:39:14,432 --> 00:39:16,378
[Mooney] I remember my first time
I went to Keeneland's,

1027
00:39:16,501 --> 00:39:18,777
we took a Learjet up there,
my girlfriend and I.

1028
00:39:18,937 --> 00:39:21,008
Jon said he was going to get
my credit okayed there.

1029
00:39:21,173 --> 00:39:23,016
"Toni, no problem.
You're Jon's girl.

1030
00:39:23,175 --> 00:39:25,314
Whatever you want.
Will a million be okay?"

1031
00:39:25,477 --> 00:39:26,547
And I was like...

1032
00:39:27,312 --> 00:39:28,552
"okay."

1033
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:31,286
And you know, if you wanted
to send your kid to college,

1034
00:39:31,450 --> 00:39:33,123
no one cared
if you paid cash.

1035
00:39:33,285 --> 00:39:35,322
[Munday] There wasn't a problem
with spending cash.

1036
00:39:35,487 --> 00:39:37,831
[woman] There are other
signs of changes.

1037
00:39:37,989 --> 00:39:40,401
Buyers are putting
more cash down on a car.

1038
00:39:40,525 --> 00:39:42,232
And they notice payment
that's more likely to be

1039
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:44,636
in cash now
instead of by credit card.

1040
00:39:44,796 --> 00:39:46,298
[Roberts] I had a turbo Porsche.

1041
00:39:46,464 --> 00:39:49,570
I had a Mercedes back then,
the 6.9 was the hot car.

1042
00:39:49,701 --> 00:39:51,146
You know the old Mercedes,
the gull wings

1043
00:39:51,303 --> 00:39:52,941
where the doors
open in the air?

1044
00:39:53,071 --> 00:39:56,450
I put $200,000 into that car
and never drove it one day.

1045
00:39:56,608 --> 00:39:58,588
I had three Cigarettes
hanging in the backyard.

1046
00:39:58,710 --> 00:39:59,586
Two cougars.

1047
00:39:59,711 --> 00:40:01,315
I had mountain lions
living in my house,

1048
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:02,584
and I had
a full time carpenter,

1049
00:40:02,714 --> 00:40:04,057
I had a full time mechanic
for my boats.

1050
00:40:04,216 --> 00:40:05,661
I had a mechanic
for my helicopter,

1051
00:40:05,817 --> 00:40:07,421
I had a pilot
to fly the helicopter.

1052
00:40:07,552 --> 00:40:08,826
And I used to gamble.

1053
00:40:08,987 --> 00:40:09,897
I would sit on a weekend

1054
00:40:10,055 --> 00:40:12,535
and I'd bet $100,000
on a football game.

1055
00:40:12,691 --> 00:40:14,967
And I had a guy who used to come
every Monday to my house,

1056
00:40:15,093 --> 00:40:16,436
and he'd know if I won or lost,

1057
00:40:16,561 --> 00:40:18,472
because his job was
to go around the house

1058
00:40:18,630 --> 00:40:20,906
to see what was broken,
the walls, the TVs,

1059
00:40:21,066 --> 00:40:22,477
and just fix everything.

1060
00:40:22,634 --> 00:40:24,204
And that was all he'd do.
It didn't matter, though.

1061
00:40:24,369 --> 00:40:25,814
It was never like,
"Oh, oh,

1062
00:40:25,937 --> 00:40:27,177
I don't have enough money
to buy this."

1063
00:40:27,339 --> 00:40:29,546
How could that be?

1064
00:40:29,708 --> 00:40:32,348
[man 1] it is estimated that
more than $80 billion

1065
00:40:32,511 --> 00:40:34,855
filters through the
underground economy each year.

1066
00:40:35,013 --> 00:40:37,619
Money the IRS
might never see.

1067
00:40:37,749 --> 00:40:38,819
[man 2] Look at the homes.

1068
00:40:38,950 --> 00:40:40,361
Look at the yachts.

1069
00:40:40,519 --> 00:40:41,998
Look at the cars.

1070
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:43,497
Look at the jewelry sales.

1071
00:40:43,655 --> 00:40:46,465
And I think you'll find that
Scarf ace is not a myth at all.

1072
00:40:46,591 --> 00:40:49,071
The old days when Jesse James
would rob a bank in Oklahoma,

1073
00:40:49,227 --> 00:40:51,332
he'd get on his horse
and ride to Kansas

1074
00:40:51,496 --> 00:40:53,498
and stay there for eight years.
But not here.

1075
00:40:53,665 --> 00:40:57,238
Here, somebody made a score,
get a Rolex,

1076
00:40:57,402 --> 00:40:59,473
buy a Ferrari,
build a big house.

1077
00:40:59,604 --> 00:41:01,641
I had a house,
and it must have been worth

1078
00:41:01,773 --> 00:41:02,911
half a million dollars
back then.

1079
00:41:03,074 --> 00:41:04,519
[Mooney] The property
was very beautiful.

1080
00:41:04,676 --> 00:41:05,882
[Roberts]
I think I had ten acres.

1081
00:41:06,044 --> 00:41:07,182
[Mooney] Automatic gates.

1082
00:41:07,345 --> 00:41:08,517
Five acres was unbuilt on,

1083
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:10,250
the other five
was where the house was.

1084
00:41:10,415 --> 00:41:13,362
One side a guest house,
one side a maid's quarters.

1085
00:41:13,518 --> 00:41:15,395
We put in a huge waterfall.

1086
00:41:15,554 --> 00:41:17,397
And then I found
the security guy,

1087
00:41:17,556 --> 00:41:20,264
and he came out
and he decided to put cameras.

1088
00:41:20,425 --> 00:41:21,870
Little birdhouses
with cameras

1089
00:41:21,993 --> 00:41:23,529
on every inch
of the property.

1090
00:41:23,695 --> 00:41:25,538
And then he said, "Well,
we can even go a step further."

1091
00:41:25,697 --> 00:41:28,109
In each corner of the house,
I had tear gas launchers.

1092
00:41:28,266 --> 00:41:30,268
There were holes in the house
and you could shoot.

1093
00:41:30,435 --> 00:41:31,743
It would shoot out
into the cars

1094
00:41:31,903 --> 00:41:33,075
from each corner of the house.

1095
00:41:33,238 --> 00:41:34,512
And I had like a remote control.

1096
00:41:34,639 --> 00:41:36,676
You pushed a button
and all the powder

1097
00:41:36,808 --> 00:41:38,116
goes all over the whole yard.

1098
00:41:38,276 --> 00:41:40,984
And I remember when we
tested the first one,

1099
00:41:41,146 --> 00:41:43,148
it sent up a cloud.
It looked like Hiroshima.

1100
00:41:43,315 --> 00:41:45,693
All my dogs and cats
were sick for like a day,

1101
00:41:45,817 --> 00:41:47,421
and it worked.

1102
00:41:47,586 --> 00:41:48,792
[man] Real estate
is an increasingly

1103
00:41:48,954 --> 00:41:50,558
popular way to hide money.

1104
00:41:50,722 --> 00:41:53,703
Launderers pay cash and
don't argue about the price.

1105
00:41:53,825 --> 00:41:55,566
I started buying property
all over the place.

1106
00:41:55,727 --> 00:41:57,934
I bought property
in Lion Country Safari,

1107
00:41:58,096 --> 00:42:00,303
Wellington,
Delray Beach.

1108
00:42:00,465 --> 00:42:03,309
[Burstyn] Tens of thousands
of properties

1109
00:42:03,468 --> 00:42:05,004
purchased by drug dealers.

1110
00:42:05,170 --> 00:42:06,012
[Munday] A couple of houses.

1111
00:42:06,171 --> 00:42:07,275
[Roberts]
We bought a boat company.

1112
00:42:07,439 --> 00:42:08,782
[Munday] Property where
the boat shop was at.

1113
00:42:08,940 --> 00:42:09,816
[Roberts] We bought apartments.

1114
00:42:09,975 --> 00:42:11,079
[Munday] Lots of warehouse space.

1115
00:42:11,209 --> 00:42:13,951
[Roberts] We bought 480
acres of land up in Tampa.

1116
00:42:14,112 --> 00:42:15,716
[Munday]
A great deal of real estate.

1117
00:42:15,847 --> 00:42:18,327
[Kimball] If you were to go and buy
a million dollars worth of land

1118
00:42:18,483 --> 00:42:20,724
in some remote
county in Florida,

1119
00:42:20,852 --> 00:42:23,731
nobody at Internal Revenue
would receive any report

1120
00:42:23,855 --> 00:42:25,459
that you made this transaction.

1121
00:42:25,624 --> 00:42:26,602
[Roberts]
We bought one other building

1122
00:42:26,758 --> 00:42:27,862
so we could make it
a radio room.

1123
00:42:28,026 --> 00:42:31,473
[Burstyn] Drug dealers would
come in and buy 8, 10, 15 houses.

1124
00:42:31,630 --> 00:42:32,574
[Munday] In one place
in South Miami,

1125
00:42:32,697 --> 00:42:34,734
I owned practically
the whole neighborhood.

1126
00:42:34,866 --> 00:42:39,008
I had $24 million
in real estate.

1127
00:42:39,170 --> 00:42:41,844
Not only are millions of
Americans addicted to drugs,

1128
00:42:42,007 --> 00:42:43,987
many banks are addicted
to drug money.

1129
00:42:44,142 --> 00:42:47,885
Cocaine trafficking
and the money, the money,

1130
00:42:48,046 --> 00:42:51,619
almost ruined any morality
in this community.

1131
00:42:51,783 --> 00:42:52,625
[man] When you're dealing with

1132
00:42:52,784 --> 00:42:53,762
hundreds of millions of dollars,

1133
00:42:53,885 --> 00:42:55,956
it's hard to keep
the government from noticing.

1134
00:42:56,087 --> 00:42:58,067
So drug profiteers
need to find a way

1135
00:42:58,223 --> 00:43:00,225
to turn their dirty money into clean,

1136
00:43:00,392 --> 00:43:02,065
non-traceable dollars.

1137
00:43:02,227 --> 00:43:03,501
It's called money laundering.

1138
00:43:03,662 --> 00:43:05,664
There are various estimates
about the amount of money

1139
00:43:05,830 --> 00:43:07,207
being laundered
through Florida.

1140
00:43:07,365 --> 00:43:09,038
And right now we could say
there's probably

1141
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:11,703
over $20 billion being
utilized in the Florida banks

1142
00:43:11,870 --> 00:43:13,247
as illegal drug money.

1143
00:43:13,405 --> 00:43:14,713
Have you ever seen a city
with so many banks?

1144
00:43:14,873 --> 00:43:16,716
Are you going to tell me
there's that kind of industry

1145
00:43:17,042 --> 00:43:18,077
and business in this city?

1146
00:43:18,243 --> 00:43:19,779
Please, come on.

1147
00:43:19,911 --> 00:43:21,652
[man] Banks popped up
almost overnight,

1148
00:43:21,813 --> 00:43:24,316
along the stretch of road
named the Brickell Avenue.

1149
00:43:24,482 --> 00:43:26,018
Drug traffickers
in the Miami area

1150
00:43:26,184 --> 00:43:27,788
try to set up their own banks.

1151
00:43:27,919 --> 00:43:29,626
[man 1] You usually need
a cooperative bank officer

1152
00:43:29,754 --> 00:43:31,631
willing to take a bribe.

1153
00:43:31,756 --> 00:43:33,827
[man 2] South East First National,
biggest in the state.

1154
00:43:33,959 --> 00:43:36,098
A number of branch employees
are suspected

1155
00:43:36,261 --> 00:43:38,263
of taking bribes
to help drug dealers.

1156
00:43:38,430 --> 00:43:39,807
[man 3] In South Florida
it was no problem,

1157
00:43:39,931 --> 00:43:41,808
because bankers
were a dime a dozen.

1158
00:43:41,933 --> 00:43:46,109
Bank presidents were in rooms
for days counting currency.

1159
00:43:46,271 --> 00:43:49,184
[man 4] --six and yeah,
this makes a thousand, right?

1160
00:43:49,307 --> 00:43:51,218
And taking a bit off the top.

1161
00:43:51,376 --> 00:43:56,382
We created the market
of banks charging 5%

1162
00:43:56,548 --> 00:43:59,552
to convert cash into deposits.

1163
00:43:59,718 --> 00:44:01,288
I don't believe
that has ever happened

1164
00:44:01,453 --> 00:44:05,196
anywhere in this country before,
and probably nowhere on earth.

1165
00:44:05,323 --> 00:44:07,701
[man] According to charges filed
by the U.S. Attorney's Office,

1166
00:44:07,859 --> 00:44:10,032
the gang deposited $70 million

1167
00:44:10,161 --> 00:44:11,834
in the Landmark
First National Bank.

1168
00:44:11,963 --> 00:44:13,909
Landmark Bank employee
Delores Aaron

1169
00:44:14,065 --> 00:44:15,544
is accused of helping
the drug dealers

1170
00:44:15,700 --> 00:44:17,270
hide the money
in special accounts.

1171
00:44:17,435 --> 00:44:18,413
Two other bank employees

1172
00:44:18,570 --> 00:44:19,947
were implicated in the scheme.

1173
00:44:20,105 --> 00:44:22,585
Of the $70 million
allegedly put into the bank,

1174
00:44:22,741 --> 00:44:25,153
only $6,000 has been
recovered by the government.

1175
00:44:25,310 --> 00:44:27,415
Agents say this is a big case,

1176
00:44:27,579 --> 00:44:30,219
but they also say it is just
a drop in the bucket

1177
00:44:30,348 --> 00:44:32,123
when compared to all the other
drug money schemes

1178
00:44:32,284 --> 00:44:34,855
they suspect are underway
in South Florida.

1179
00:44:34,986 --> 00:44:38,263
Miami has become the Wall
Street of the cocaine trade.

1180
00:44:38,423 --> 00:44:40,096
The Federal Reserve Bank of Miami

1181
00:44:40,258 --> 00:44:43,398
had a cash excess of $4.5 billion,

1182
00:44:43,561 --> 00:44:44,972
and literally
no place to store it.

1183
00:44:45,130 --> 00:44:47,474
It had to be distributed
to other banks

1184
00:44:47,632 --> 00:44:48,736
across the country.

1185
00:44:48,900 --> 00:44:51,005
Cash is still being
shipped out weekly.

1186
00:44:51,169 --> 00:44:54,173
The surplus cash in the
Miami area constitutes

1187
00:44:54,339 --> 00:44:56,649
half of all the cash,
surplus cash,

1188
00:44:56,808 --> 00:44:57,752
in the entire country.

1189
00:44:57,909 --> 00:44:59,616
[man] Even the law itself
has been compromised

1190
00:44:59,778 --> 00:45:01,553
by the incredible profits.

1191
00:45:01,679 --> 00:45:02,749
Everybody had a price.

1192
00:45:02,914 --> 00:45:04,894
[man] You can't have major
operations like this

1193
00:45:05,016 --> 00:45:07,326
without the corruption of police.

1194
00:45:07,485 --> 00:45:08,759
[Roberts] I happen to notice
this lieutenant

1195
00:45:08,920 --> 00:45:09,955
that worked in North Bay Village.

1196
00:45:10,121 --> 00:45:11,293
I approached him one day
and I said,

1197
00:45:11,456 --> 00:45:12,196
"Listen, I want
to unload some boats

1198
00:45:12,357 --> 00:45:14,598
behind the North Bay Village
Police Department.

1199
00:45:14,759 --> 00:45:16,295
Do you think we've got
any problem doing that?"

1200
00:45:16,461 --> 00:45:17,735
And he was wide open
to the idea.

1201
00:45:17,862 --> 00:45:19,205
He even went to the point
where he said,

1202
00:45:19,364 --> 00:45:20,968
"I'll tell you what,
we'll have two patrol cars

1203
00:45:21,132 --> 00:45:22,167
and we'll throw it in the back
of the patrol cars

1204
00:45:22,333 --> 00:45:24,335
and drive it
wherever you want."

1205
00:45:24,502 --> 00:45:26,106
And he got two or three guys
in the police department.

1206
00:45:26,237 --> 00:45:27,443
They put up
crime scene tapes,

1207
00:45:27,605 --> 00:45:29,175
and we'd have trucks
backed up to the water,

1208
00:45:29,340 --> 00:45:30,444
and then they'd
throw the shit in.

1209
00:45:30,675 --> 00:45:33,178
"See you later, man."
And they just waved good-bye.

1210
00:45:33,344 --> 00:45:35,950
[woman] Two North Bay Village
sergeants and a corporal,

1211
00:45:36,080 --> 00:45:38,321
Officer of the Year
Sergeant William Risk,

1212
00:45:38,483 --> 00:45:41,521
Sergeant Fernando Ganden, and
Corporal George Stephaloras,

1213
00:45:41,686 --> 00:45:43,791
face drug conspiracy charges.

1214
00:45:43,955 --> 00:45:46,333
[Buchanan] Some policemen
with their red Porsches

1215
00:45:46,491 --> 00:45:48,027
would crash
in a one car accident

1216
00:45:48,193 --> 00:45:50,833
and they'd be found to have
cocaine in their systems.

1217
00:45:50,995 --> 00:45:52,997
Early this morning,
a Miami officer was involved

1218
00:45:53,164 --> 00:45:54,142
in a high-speed chase.

1219
00:45:54,265 --> 00:45:56,245
When the Metro car tried
to stop the vehicle,

1220
00:45:56,401 --> 00:45:58,779
the Porsche accelerated
and outran it.

1221
00:45:58,903 --> 00:46:01,782
The Porsche was traveling
at least 100 mph.

1222
00:46:01,906 --> 00:46:03,715
The driver then got
out of the car and told police

1223
00:46:03,875 --> 00:46:07,049
that he too was a police officer
with the City of Miami.

1224
00:46:07,212 --> 00:46:11,661
Police found $1,180
in $20 bills under his seat.

1225
00:46:11,816 --> 00:46:13,386
The department's
internal security

1226
00:46:13,551 --> 00:46:14,859
will undoubtedly be
looking into

1227
00:46:15,019 --> 00:46:17,363
why this officer was running
from other police,

1228
00:46:17,522 --> 00:46:19,900
and what he was doing with
all that money in the car.

1229
00:46:20,058 --> 00:46:22,868
And indeed, there are
probably countless more

1230
00:46:23,027 --> 00:46:25,564
police officers
that didn't get caught.

1231
00:46:25,730 --> 00:46:28,404
The entire criminal
justice system

1232
00:46:28,566 --> 00:46:30,409
was riddled with bribery.

1233
00:46:30,568 --> 00:46:32,741
There is now
no bigger business in Miami

1234
00:46:32,904 --> 00:46:34,247
than the drug business,

1235
00:46:34,405 --> 00:46:36,385
bringing with it
international intrigue,

1236
00:46:36,541 --> 00:46:38,919
uncontrolled violence,
corruption,

1237
00:46:39,077 --> 00:46:42,115
and what appears to be
a breakdown in law enforcement.

1238
00:46:42,280 --> 00:46:44,385
[Burstyn] When you couple
police corruption

1239
00:46:44,549 --> 00:46:47,393
to corruption of lawyers
and corruption of judges,

1240
00:46:47,552 --> 00:46:48,929
you have no law.

1241
00:46:51,456 --> 00:46:55,700
My first real exposure to,
I guess, the drug world.

1242
00:46:55,860 --> 00:46:57,771
Within months of
getting in homicide,

1243
00:46:57,929 --> 00:47:00,136
I realized that
about a dozen of my peers

1244
00:47:00,298 --> 00:47:01,299
in the homicide bureau

1245
00:47:01,466 --> 00:47:03,377
are under investigation
by the FBI.

1246
00:47:03,501 --> 00:47:05,947
The FBI says it has
prosecutable evidence

1247
00:47:06,104 --> 00:47:08,448
that members of the
Dade County Homicide Squad

1248
00:47:08,606 --> 00:47:10,244
are partners
with the dope dealers.

1249
00:47:10,408 --> 00:47:12,410
When I arrived in homicide,

1250
00:47:12,577 --> 00:47:15,751
it was the tail end
of the cocaine cops.

1251
00:47:15,914 --> 00:47:17,291
This was a group
of homicide detectives

1252
00:47:17,448 --> 00:47:20,918
who had been involved with
a human narcotics distributor

1253
00:47:21,085 --> 00:47:22,723
by the name of Mario Escandar.

1254
00:47:22,887 --> 00:47:24,958
Seven Dade County homicide
detectives have been

1255
00:47:25,123 --> 00:47:27,330
subpoenaed today
by a Federal Grand Jury--

1256
00:47:27,492 --> 00:47:29,335
For the homicide bureau
itself it was just devastating.

1257
00:47:29,494 --> 00:47:32,634
I mean, all of a sudden,
your entire top level of

1258
00:47:32,797 --> 00:47:35,710
experienced personnel
are going to jail.

1259
00:47:35,833 --> 00:47:38,814
The cocaine cops raises
a number of chilling questions

1260
00:47:38,970 --> 00:47:41,041
about Dade County
law enforcement.

1261
00:47:41,172 --> 00:47:43,448
These folks who got indicted

1262
00:47:43,608 --> 00:47:46,748
were the most experienced
homicide investigators.

1263
00:47:46,911 --> 00:47:48,254
So all of a sudden,

1264
00:47:48,379 --> 00:47:50,723
we became the senior
detectives in the bureau,

1265
00:47:50,848 --> 00:47:52,885
and that is what you call
real on-the-job training.

1266
00:47:53,017 --> 00:47:55,588
I met Al Singleton
when I came up to homicide.

1267
00:47:55,753 --> 00:47:59,428
Singleton always wrote about

1268
00:47:59,557 --> 00:48:01,366
the rest
of the detectives there,

1269
00:48:01,526 --> 00:48:03,005
and he was in a squad.

1270
00:48:03,161 --> 00:48:05,004
They had a special squad
for a short period of time,

1271
00:48:05,163 --> 00:48:07,803
called the Specialized
Homicide Investigation Team.

1272
00:48:07,999 --> 00:48:10,843
A S.H.l.T. squad. it was a special
homicide investigative team.

1273
00:48:11,002 --> 00:48:12,538
It was assigned to work
these Latin drug cases.

1274
00:48:12,704 --> 00:48:13,682
Crime changed.

1275
00:48:13,838 --> 00:48:15,545
There were a lot of dead bodies
that were young Hispanic,

1276
00:48:15,707 --> 00:48:17,186
young Latinos--

1277
00:48:17,342 --> 00:48:20,346
And then what really
said to me that we were

1278
00:48:20,511 --> 00:48:22,650
in a different time,
was Dadeland.

1279
00:48:22,814 --> 00:48:24,919
[man 1] The first public shot
in the cocaine wars.

1280
00:48:25,049 --> 00:48:27,859
[man 2] July of 1979
at Miami's busy

1281
00:48:28,019 --> 00:48:28,861
Dadeland Mall
shopping center.

1282
00:48:29,020 --> 00:48:30,693
[Buchanan] It was like high noon

1283
00:48:30,855 --> 00:48:32,926
in the busiest shopping
center in Dade County.

1284
00:48:33,057 --> 00:48:35,162
[man 2] At 2:30 in the afternoon--

1285
00:48:35,326 --> 00:48:39,035
[Davis] And here's this big truck,
party time truck. It pulls in.

1286
00:48:39,197 --> 00:48:40,801
Nobody would pay
any attention to that.

1287
00:48:40,965 --> 00:48:43,138
These fellows get out.
They go into a liquor store.

1288
00:48:43,268 --> 00:48:45,839
The next thing you know,
there's a bit shootout going on.

1289
00:48:48,873 --> 00:48:51,319
[man] Several Colombian assassins
fired machine guns

1290
00:48:51,442 --> 00:48:53,183
and other weapons
into a liquor store,

1291
00:48:53,344 --> 00:48:55,517
killing narcotics dealer
Herman Jimenez

1292
00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:56,886
and his bodyguard.

1293
00:48:57,048 --> 00:48:59,392
Also wounded were the store
clerk and a stock boy.

1294
00:48:59,550 --> 00:49:00,790
[Buchanan] The assistant
medical examiner came.

1295
00:49:00,919 --> 00:49:02,227
I asked him how many times

1296
00:49:02,387 --> 00:49:04,867
the chief target had been shot,
and he said,

1297
00:49:05,023 --> 00:49:07,594
"I stopped counting.
He's like Swiss cheese."

1298
00:49:07,759 --> 00:49:09,363
[woman] The gunmen
fled the liquor store,

1299
00:49:09,527 --> 00:49:11,529
still firing at cars
and shoppers.

1300
00:49:11,696 --> 00:49:15,166
[man 1] And they sprayed the entire
parking lot of that mall.

1301
00:49:15,300 --> 00:49:16,745
[man 2] They said, "Someone
out there has got a shotgun

1302
00:49:16,901 --> 00:49:17,811
and they're shooting."

1303
00:49:17,935 --> 00:49:19,380
You could hear shots
like popguns.

1304
00:49:19,537 --> 00:49:21,915
[man 3] And then they flee and
they leave this truck behind.

1305
00:49:22,073 --> 00:49:24,144
[Singleton] A secondary scene,
which is where I was assigned to,

1306
00:49:24,275 --> 00:49:25,982
is what has become
known as the war wagon.

1307
00:49:26,110 --> 00:49:27,248
[man] The war wagon left behind

1308
00:49:27,412 --> 00:49:28,982
by the machine gun
wielding killers.

1309
00:49:29,113 --> 00:49:31,684
This truck is a floating armory.

1310
00:49:31,849 --> 00:49:34,193
[woman] Police found the van
fully equipped with guns,

1311
00:49:34,319 --> 00:49:36,094
bullet proof vests
and ammunition.

1312
00:49:36,254 --> 00:49:37,824
[man] Metro police
don't have a vehicle

1313
00:49:37,956 --> 00:49:39,060
equipped like this one.

1314
00:49:39,223 --> 00:49:42,432
[woman] The van was marked "Happy
Time Complete Party Supply".

1315
00:49:42,593 --> 00:49:44,072
Officers say
the name of the firm

1316
00:49:44,228 --> 00:49:46,299
and the phone number
are fictitious.

1317
00:49:46,464 --> 00:49:49,308
When I saw the war wagon,

1318
00:49:49,467 --> 00:49:52,914
when I saw the amount
of weapons that were there,

1319
00:49:53,071 --> 00:49:55,847
when I saw the amount
of preparation,

1320
00:49:55,973 --> 00:49:58,283
that said to me
we were in a different game.

1321
00:49:58,442 --> 00:50:00,945
[man] Detectives say the war
started on April 23rd,

1322
00:50:01,112 --> 00:50:03,592
a gun battle broke out between
the occupants of two cars,

1323
00:50:03,748 --> 00:50:05,125
racing around south Dade.

1324
00:50:05,283 --> 00:50:06,660
Two cars are shooting it out,

1325
00:50:06,818 --> 00:50:07,853
and then the police
cars gets involved

1326
00:50:07,986 --> 00:50:10,262
and they start shooting at
the police car. The car crashes.

1327
00:50:10,421 --> 00:50:13,231
These people, before they
got here a few weeks ago,

1328
00:50:13,358 --> 00:50:15,668
were probably riding horses
in the mountains of Colombia

1329
00:50:15,827 --> 00:50:17,465
shooting at each other.
And now they were

1330
00:50:17,629 --> 00:50:20,667
in these expensive new cars
shooting it out on the turnpike.

1331
00:50:20,832 --> 00:50:23,870
[man 1] The Black Audi pictured here
was owned by German Panesso.

1332
00:50:24,002 --> 00:50:26,881
Inside the trunk, police found
the body of Amy Suskin,

1333
00:50:27,005 --> 00:50:29,281
another top figure
in a Colombian drug family.

1334
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:32,216
Police say Suskin
was killed in retaliation

1335
00:50:32,343 --> 00:50:34,254
for the murder
of Panesso's maid.

1336
00:50:34,378 --> 00:50:36,221
Metro police say
the war is still on.

1337
00:50:36,347 --> 00:50:38,327
[man 2] Every day in 1980,
police say

1338
00:50:38,483 --> 00:50:41,657
has become just another day
in Dade's city.

1339
00:50:41,819 --> 00:50:43,799
The rate of killing here is
accelerating

1340
00:50:43,955 --> 00:50:45,992
faster than
any other area in the nation.

1341
00:50:46,157 --> 00:50:47,898
The efficient work
of a gang the police

1342
00:50:48,025 --> 00:50:49,936
called the Cocaine Cowboys.

1343
00:50:50,094 --> 00:50:51,539
[Munday] --as they call them
The Cocaine Cowboys--

1344
00:50:51,696 --> 00:50:53,471
[man 1] For some reason,
American society

1345
00:50:53,631 --> 00:50:56,237
has always had this fascination
with the free-wheeling,

1346
00:50:56,367 --> 00:50:58,176
high-sticking,
gun-toting outlaw.

1347
00:50:58,336 --> 00:51:01,647
The cocaine cowboys are as
romantic as they are deadly.

1348
00:51:01,806 --> 00:51:04,480
[man 2] Cocaine has always been,
always been a violent business.

1349
00:51:04,642 --> 00:51:08,488
[man 3] The rip-offs are becoming
part of their job hazard so to speak.

1350
00:51:08,646 --> 00:51:11,092
If someone steals
50 pounds of marijuana,

1351
00:51:11,215 --> 00:51:13,354
that's a $10,000 deal.

1352
00:51:13,518 --> 00:51:17,557
But when someone doesn't
pay for 20 kilos of cocaine

1353
00:51:17,722 --> 00:51:19,929
at $50,000 a kilo,

1354
00:51:20,057 --> 00:51:21,400
you're talking about
$1 million deal.

1355
00:51:21,559 --> 00:51:25,166
[man] They will hesitate
at nothing to fire on people

1356
00:51:25,330 --> 00:51:27,810
if even suspect they were
gonna try to rip them off.

1357
00:51:27,965 --> 00:51:30,275
They were so many
shootouts in Miami.

1358
00:51:30,401 --> 00:51:32,381
Numerous machine guns
are on the highways,

1359
00:51:32,537 --> 00:51:35,017
the turnpike, US1,
residential streets.

1360
00:51:35,172 --> 00:51:35,980
[man] In broad daylight

1361
00:51:36,140 --> 00:51:38,177
on Dade County's crowded
Palmetto Expressway,

1362
00:51:38,343 --> 00:51:40,186
a suspected drug dealer
has just been shot

1363
00:51:40,344 --> 00:51:42,017
by machine gun
wielding assassins.

1364
00:51:42,180 --> 00:51:43,158
This looks like
one of those scenes

1365
00:51:43,314 --> 00:51:44,418
you might see in Vietnam,
you know.

1366
00:51:44,582 --> 00:51:46,152
[Potter]
Unlike other crime groups,

1367
00:51:46,317 --> 00:51:48,024
the Colombians
will shoot family members,

1368
00:51:48,186 --> 00:51:50,188
and will fire
into crowded places.

1369
00:51:50,354 --> 00:51:52,061
Poor people that were
standing there and kids,

1370
00:51:52,223 --> 00:51:53,224
anybody would just
get chopped up.

1371
00:51:53,391 --> 00:51:55,200
[Buchanan] They just would kill
everybody in sight.

1372
00:51:55,359 --> 00:51:56,497
[Potter] Beleaguered South Florida

1373
00:51:56,627 --> 00:51:58,231
law enforcers said
that Colombian assassins

1374
00:51:58,396 --> 00:52:00,706
don't seem to care if there
are innocent victims,

1375
00:52:00,865 --> 00:52:03,038
as they bring to Miami
a type of violence

1376
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:04,543
it has never seen before.

1377
00:52:04,702 --> 00:52:05,442
Near the Miami stadium,

1378
00:52:05,603 --> 00:52:07,981
a 3-year-old boy
was shot and paralyzed

1379
00:52:08,105 --> 00:52:09,675
when assassins
killed his father.

1380
00:52:09,807 --> 00:52:11,548
A 14-year-old girl
was murdered.

1381
00:52:11,709 --> 00:52:14,053
At high noon,
a Colombian cocaine dealer

1382
00:52:14,212 --> 00:52:16,214
was shot in a crowded
pizza parlor

1383
00:52:16,381 --> 00:52:17,758
after the killers
ordered lunch.

1384
00:52:17,915 --> 00:52:20,418
When they found a young
Hispanic person dead

1385
00:52:20,585 --> 00:52:22,428
the police
automatically assumed

1386
00:52:22,586 --> 00:52:23,724
it was cocaine related.

1387
00:52:23,888 --> 00:52:25,367
Sometimes you'd read
in the paper,

1388
00:52:25,490 --> 00:52:27,993
wow, you know,
like I know this guy.

1389
00:52:28,125 --> 00:52:30,071
You know, he's like
got murdered

1390
00:52:30,228 --> 00:52:31,866
or he got arrested for it.

1391
00:52:32,029 --> 00:52:33,474
[man 1] More and more
Colombian traffickers

1392
00:52:33,631 --> 00:52:36,111
bring their incredible
brand of violence here.

1393
00:52:36,267 --> 00:52:37,610
We have had kidnappings

1394
00:52:37,768 --> 00:52:39,611
and machine gun murders
in broad daylight.

1395
00:52:39,770 --> 00:52:40,942
[man 2] It was just unbelievable.

1396
00:52:41,105 --> 00:52:42,083
You hear the shots,

1397
00:52:42,239 --> 00:52:43,479
but they miss him,
and they got this one.

1398
00:52:43,641 --> 00:52:46,121
[man 3] All of a sudden, I heard
a number of shots about 10 or 12.

1399
00:52:46,277 --> 00:52:47,813
And I was just out
walking my dogs.

1400
00:52:47,979 --> 00:52:50,653
And all of a sudden I heard
all this shooting going on.

1401
00:52:50,815 --> 00:52:52,123
The shots woke me up.

1402
00:52:52,283 --> 00:52:53,387
And I heard the bullets
over my head,

1403
00:52:53,518 --> 00:52:54,496
and I hit the ground.

1404
00:52:54,652 --> 00:52:57,030
That's the kind of stuff
you see on television.

1405
00:52:57,155 --> 00:52:58,498
You don't see it
in real life.

1406
00:52:58,656 --> 00:53:00,101
[man] Four shots
in broad daylight

1407
00:53:00,258 --> 00:53:02,670
in full view of several
stunned witnesses.

1408
00:53:02,827 --> 00:53:05,273
But this was real life.
That was really going on.

1409
00:53:05,429 --> 00:53:06,840
[Buchanan] At the Doral,
the beach police

1410
00:53:06,997 --> 00:53:09,273
had an undercover
drug buy going on.

1411
00:53:09,433 --> 00:53:11,640
Five people were shot,
including their own informant.

1412
00:53:11,802 --> 00:53:13,247
They shot their own
informant by mistake.

1413
00:53:13,404 --> 00:53:16,044
Gunfire, wounded bodies,
people screaming

1414
00:53:16,174 --> 00:53:18,279
and the people at the Doral
did not panic.

1415
00:53:18,442 --> 00:53:21,480
A lot of them thought they were
just filming Miami Vice.

1416
00:53:21,646 --> 00:53:24,991
[man] Police usually have no idea
who the Colombians are.

1417
00:53:25,149 --> 00:53:26,992
They all had
half a dozen identities.

1418
00:53:27,151 --> 00:53:30,496
The criminals use an astounding
number of false IDs and aliases.

1419
00:53:30,655 --> 00:53:32,157
And a lot of these
Colombians claim to be

1420
00:53:32,323 --> 00:53:33,927
from Puerto Rico,
but they couldn't spell it.

1421
00:53:34,092 --> 00:53:36,538
[man] invariably they are here
with phony ID,

1422
00:53:36,694 --> 00:53:38,298
frequently posing
as Puerto Ricans.

1423
00:53:38,462 --> 00:53:41,170
Sometimes detectives can't
even identify the victims.

1424
00:53:41,332 --> 00:53:43,539
Traditionally,
the homicide investigators'

1425
00:53:43,701 --> 00:53:47,080
hardest case to solve
is the "who done it."

1426
00:53:47,204 --> 00:53:49,650
In Miami we had,
"who is it?"

1427
00:53:49,807 --> 00:53:52,253
It's very hard to find out
who killed somebody

1428
00:53:52,376 --> 00:53:53,514
if you don't know
who got killed.

1429
00:53:53,678 --> 00:53:55,419
Of course, if you
happen to be illegal

1430
00:53:55,546 --> 00:53:57,548
coming in across the border,

1431
00:53:57,715 --> 00:54:00,662
fingerprints don't help you much
because there's no records.

1432
00:54:00,818 --> 00:54:02,695
[man] Police also have
a hard time enticing

1433
00:54:02,853 --> 00:54:04,833
witnesses and informants
to work with them.

1434
00:54:04,989 --> 00:54:06,468
I don't have any idea
what's happened.

1435
00:54:06,590 --> 00:54:08,331
They may not be able to say
very much in English

1436
00:54:08,492 --> 00:54:10,472
but they'll know how to say,
"I want an attorney"

1437
00:54:10,595 --> 00:54:11,573
or "I don't know."

1438
00:54:11,729 --> 00:54:14,005
We're dealing with crimes
which have

1439
00:54:14,198 --> 00:54:16,838
international repercussions
and for which

1440
00:54:17,001 --> 00:54:19,277
the men that work
at local police department

1441
00:54:19,403 --> 00:54:21,212
in the United States
are not trained to deal.

1442
00:54:21,372 --> 00:54:23,818
[man] Four bodies left
in the trunk of a Chevrolet.

1443
00:54:23,941 --> 00:54:26,217
One of the victims was an
informant for the DEA.

1444
00:54:26,377 --> 00:54:27,685
All of the victims
had been tortured.

1445
00:54:27,845 --> 00:54:31,349
[Buchanan] People that say Miami
was on the ragged edge of anarchy

1446
00:54:31,516 --> 00:54:33,860
were probably right.

1447
00:54:34,018 --> 00:54:37,556
And I know that in many ways
I contributed to it.

1448
00:54:37,722 --> 00:54:39,497
Many people would have
been a lot happier

1449
00:54:39,624 --> 00:54:43,003
if Arthur McDuffie had
remained a traffic statistic.

1450
00:54:43,160 --> 00:54:47,006
[man] He was a black insurance man
named Arthur McDuffie.

1451
00:54:47,164 --> 00:54:48,700
And he died
after an altercation

1452
00:54:48,866 --> 00:54:50,504
with Metro Dade Police.

1453
00:54:50,634 --> 00:54:51,840
The officers involved

1454
00:54:51,969 --> 00:54:53,744
were charged with
a cover up of the incident

1455
00:54:53,904 --> 00:54:55,076
only to be found...

1456
00:54:55,239 --> 00:54:56,377
[woman] Not guilty.

1457
00:54:56,541 --> 00:54:59,613
So say we all--

1458
00:54:59,777 --> 00:55:01,882
[man 1] What happened
after that is history.

1459
00:55:04,982 --> 00:55:07,963
Three days of riots,
18 people dead.

1460
00:55:08,119 --> 00:55:09,860
[man 2] We are human beings,

1461
00:55:09,987 --> 00:55:11,864
and we want to be treated
like human beings.

1462
00:55:11,989 --> 00:55:13,900
And then came
the Mariel boatlift.

1463
00:55:14,558 --> 00:55:17,539
[man] The trauma
of the Mariel boatlift

1464
00:55:17,662 --> 00:55:19,903
is one of the most dramatic
influxes of immigrants

1465
00:55:20,064 --> 00:55:21,771
in such a short period of time

1466
00:55:21,933 --> 00:55:23,810
in one place
in American history.

1467
00:55:23,968 --> 00:55:26,881
The first boat arrived
on April 21st, 1980.

1468
00:55:27,004 --> 00:55:30,281
The Carter administration
met the crisis with confusion.

1469
00:55:30,441 --> 00:55:33,547
[woman] On May 5, shortly after
President Carter's

1470
00:55:33,678 --> 00:55:35,749
"open arms, open heart"
statement,

1471
00:55:35,913 --> 00:55:39,417
71 Cuban-Americans obtained
a U.S. customs clearance

1472
00:55:39,583 --> 00:55:42,427
for the freighter Red Diamond
to sail to Mariel, Cuba.

1473
00:55:42,586 --> 00:55:45,897
[man 1] The Carter administration
said the Cubans were welcomed,

1474
00:55:46,023 --> 00:55:49,266
that we might be able
to handle 3,500 of them.

1475
00:55:49,427 --> 00:55:52,931
The result was, they came
unhindered, night and day.

1476
00:55:53,097 --> 00:55:54,667
[man 2] They are called
Marielitos.

1477
00:55:54,832 --> 00:55:55,833
As they left Cuba,

1478
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,810
Castro called them "escoria,"
which means "scum."

1479
00:55:58,969 --> 00:56:01,540
[man 3] Fidel Castro himself
publicly stated,

1480
00:56:01,672 --> 00:56:04,312
"I have flushed the toilets
of Cuba on the United States."

1481
00:56:04,475 --> 00:56:05,783
He bragged about it.

1482
00:56:05,943 --> 00:56:08,321
[man 4] With one full swoop,
Castro rid Cuba

1483
00:56:08,479 --> 00:56:10,686
of thousands and thousands
of undesirables.

1484
00:56:10,848 --> 00:56:14,227
[Buchanan] For all of the decent,
hardworking refugees

1485
00:56:14,351 --> 00:56:15,955
who came here
to make new lives,

1486
00:56:16,120 --> 00:56:19,624
there were also the deadliest,
most ruthless criminals

1487
00:56:19,790 --> 00:56:22,327
that have ever been unleashed
on any country in the world.

1488
00:56:22,493 --> 00:56:25,440
[man] There are among those
people murderers, rapists,

1489
00:56:25,963 --> 00:56:27,943
child molesters,
dangerous individuals.

1490
00:56:28,065 --> 00:56:30,705
We first noticed it
with their shoes.

1491
00:56:30,868 --> 00:56:33,610
The kind issued
by Cuban prisons.

1492
00:56:33,737 --> 00:56:35,944
There was a prison
on the Isle of Pines

1493
00:56:36,073 --> 00:56:38,986
that had 2,000
hardcore prisoners.

1494
00:56:39,143 --> 00:56:41,817
One week later, there were
only about 20 prisoners

1495
00:56:41,979 --> 00:56:43,185
left in that prison.

1496
00:56:43,347 --> 00:56:44,690
What about the rest?

1497
00:56:44,848 --> 00:56:46,486
They were walking
on the streets of Miami.

1498
00:56:46,650 --> 00:56:47,993
[Buchanan] Wouldn't it
be nice if we could take

1499
00:56:48,152 --> 00:56:49,722
everybody off death row,

1500
00:56:49,887 --> 00:56:52,128
everybody in prisons and jails

1501
00:56:52,290 --> 00:56:54,964
and mental institutions
for the criminally insane

1502
00:56:55,092 --> 00:56:56,662
and send them all
off to some nice place

1503
00:56:56,827 --> 00:56:59,433
where they'll be welcomed
by some unsuspecting community?

1504
00:56:59,563 --> 00:57:01,201
[man] Castro put a good one
over on us.

1505
00:57:01,365 --> 00:57:03,868
There are a lot of criminals
who came over

1506
00:57:04,034 --> 00:57:05,638
in the Mariel boatlift.

1507
00:57:05,769 --> 00:57:08,841
I have never seen people
like that in my life in Cuba.

1508
00:57:09,006 --> 00:57:10,212
They do not
respect anything.

1509
00:57:10,374 --> 00:57:11,546
They do not respect
law and order,

1510
00:57:11,709 --> 00:57:13,154
they do not
respect kindness.

1511
00:57:13,310 --> 00:57:15,312
You know, they were public
enemy number one in Cuba.

1512
00:57:15,479 --> 00:57:20,224
Guys who were violent criminals
under a communist regime

1513
00:57:20,384 --> 00:57:22,557
in which it was not easy
to be criminal,

1514
00:57:22,720 --> 00:57:25,894
when they came here then
they became super criminals.

1515
00:57:26,056 --> 00:57:27,330
[man] They have been described

1516
00:57:27,491 --> 00:57:29,994
by the Director of the
Federal Bureau of Prisons

1517
00:57:30,127 --> 00:57:31,538
as among the most
dangerous criminals

1518
00:57:31,695 --> 00:57:34,301
he's ever dealt with in his
23 years in corrections.

1519
00:57:34,431 --> 00:57:35,910
We're dealing with
a serious problem here.

1520
00:57:36,066 --> 00:57:38,205
And consequently our homicide
rate doubled that year.

1521
00:57:38,369 --> 00:57:41,213
I knew we were
in deep trouble.

1522
00:57:41,372 --> 00:57:43,079
[man] When the refugees
were pouring in,

1523
00:57:43,240 --> 00:57:45,846
the crime rate shot up 89%.

1524
00:57:45,976 --> 00:57:48,320
[Buchanan] The crime rate soared,
women were being snatched

1525
00:57:48,445 --> 00:57:50,083
off the street,
raped and murdered.

1526
00:57:50,247 --> 00:57:53,524
[man 1] In 1978, the city
had 15 reported rapes.

1527
00:57:53,684 --> 00:57:55,721
But in the first
seven months of this year,

1528
00:57:55,886 --> 00:57:58,127
the figure has reached 59.

1529
00:57:58,288 --> 00:58:01,929
90% of the persons arrested
in those cases were refugees.

1530
00:58:02,093 --> 00:58:03,902
[man 2] Murder remains
the number one cause of death

1531
00:58:04,061 --> 00:58:05,870
among Mariel refugees.

1532
00:58:05,996 --> 00:58:08,567
It amounts to roughly
about 48% of our homicides.

1533
00:58:09,166 --> 00:58:10,668
[Buchanan] People were being
gunned down in bars

1534
00:58:10,801 --> 00:58:12,212
just to see
who is more macho.

1535
00:58:12,369 --> 00:58:14,815
Two men argued over
a lawnmower repair job

1536
00:58:14,972 --> 00:58:17,748
and in the classic Wild West
Matt Dillon tradition,

1537
00:58:17,908 --> 00:58:20,388
one man challenged
the other to a gun draw.

1538
00:58:20,544 --> 00:58:21,955
Cars were careening
through the streets

1539
00:58:22,112 --> 00:58:23,455
looking for the hospital
because they had

1540
00:58:23,614 --> 00:58:25,457
two or three wounded people
in the backseat.

1541
00:58:25,616 --> 00:58:28,563
[man] Mrs. Louise Thompson
lost her 17-year-old son Michael

1542
00:58:28,719 --> 00:58:30,164
as he refused
to give a stranger

1543
00:58:30,320 --> 00:58:31,560
the end of his cigarette.

1544
00:58:31,722 --> 00:58:34,931
In return, he got shot
with a .357 Magnum.

1545
00:58:35,092 --> 00:58:36,366
And they would
see a car they liked,

1546
00:58:36,494 --> 00:58:38,405
and they'd kill whoever
was in it and take the car.

1547
00:58:38,562 --> 00:58:40,405
[man 1] The man who rammed
several metro police cars

1548
00:58:40,564 --> 00:58:43,374
yesterday injuring
one officer before he died

1549
00:58:43,501 --> 00:58:46,004
was identified today
as a recent Cuban refugee

1550
00:58:46,170 --> 00:58:47,581
from the Mariel sealift.

1551
00:58:47,738 --> 00:58:49,718
[man 2] Many of the Mariels
who left Cuban jails

1552
00:58:49,840 --> 00:58:52,411
worshiped the African idol Xango.

1553
00:58:52,576 --> 00:58:55,557
They feel Xango rescued them
from Castro's prisons.

1554
00:58:55,679 --> 00:58:57,454
And others still relying
on pagan rituals

1555
00:58:57,615 --> 00:59:00,152
called Santeria before they
commit their crimes.

1556
00:59:00,317 --> 00:59:02,763
Buying potions in shops
called Botanicas,

1557
00:59:02,887 --> 00:59:05,128
potions they believe
will protect them from police

1558
00:59:05,289 --> 00:59:06,996
and make them
invulnerable to bullets.

1559
00:59:07,157 --> 00:59:08,966
[Buchanan]The police didn't know
about Santeria.

1560
00:59:09,126 --> 00:59:11,265
They would go to a house
on some routine call

1561
00:59:11,428 --> 00:59:12,668
and they find a cauldron

1562
00:59:12,830 --> 00:59:15,504
with human leg bones sticking
out of it and human skulls.

1563
00:59:15,666 --> 00:59:18,044
Even the dead
aren't safe in Miami.

1564
00:59:18,202 --> 00:59:19,977
[man] It's now a community
is straining to cope

1565
00:59:20,137 --> 00:59:23,778
with the influx of more than
100,000 Cuban refugees.

1566
00:59:23,908 --> 00:59:26,684
We don't have resources
for the refugees right now.

1567
00:59:26,844 --> 00:59:30,792
We definitely have no monies
for regional social services.

1568
00:59:30,915 --> 00:59:32,588
We don't have
any resources.

1569
00:59:32,716 --> 00:59:36,027
And there was not a single soul
at the federal level

1570
00:59:36,186 --> 00:59:39,224
or in the judicial level
who appreciates the fact

1571
00:59:39,390 --> 00:59:41,461
that the system
we have in this country

1572
00:59:41,625 --> 00:59:43,866
is set up
for human beings,

1573
00:59:44,028 --> 00:59:46,634
not for people who are not even
members of the human race.

1574
00:59:46,797 --> 00:59:49,243
[man] So the Freedom boatlift
is ending in controversy.

1575
00:59:49,400 --> 00:59:50,344
There are those that say

1576
00:59:50,501 --> 00:59:52,310
it's been a needless burden
on our country

1577
00:59:52,469 --> 00:59:54,642
and it should have been
stopped long ago.

1578
00:59:54,805 --> 00:59:58,184
[woman] Why should one community
in the entire country

1579
00:59:58,342 --> 01:00:01,084
pay for the federal
government's error in judgment?

1580
01:00:01,245 --> 01:00:04,556
The state of Florida
has no navy, no air force,

1581
01:00:04,715 --> 01:00:07,889
no immigration service,
no customs unit, no radar,

1582
01:00:08,052 --> 01:00:11,522
no CIA, no foreign service to
deal with foreign countries.

1583
01:00:11,689 --> 01:00:14,636
The state has no way
to prevent such new arrivals

1584
01:00:14,758 --> 01:00:17,705
nor a way of returning them
from whence they came.

1585
01:00:17,861 --> 01:00:20,808
Jimmy Carter has six more
weeks to serve as president.

1586
01:00:20,931 --> 01:00:23,537
He has been big
on human rights.

1587
01:00:23,701 --> 01:00:26,545
To protect the human rights
of the people of Miami,

1588
01:00:26,703 --> 01:00:30,651
he still has time to arrange
an exodus back to Cuba

1589
01:00:30,774 --> 01:00:33,050
for these undesirable Cubans.

1590
01:00:33,210 --> 01:00:35,816
Airlift them to our
naval base at Guantanamo,

1591
01:00:35,946 --> 01:00:38,290
open the gate,
and let these Cubans

1592
01:00:38,448 --> 01:00:40,655
be returned to their sender.

1593
01:00:40,784 --> 01:00:42,491
Good night.
May the good news be yours.

1594
01:00:42,620 --> 01:00:45,499
We have narcotics
related homicide,

1595
01:00:45,623 --> 01:00:48,103
then we have
Mariel related homicide,

1596
01:00:48,258 --> 01:00:50,704
and then we have
these riots.

1597
01:00:50,861 --> 01:00:54,673
That just created
the perfect storm

1598
01:00:54,798 --> 01:00:57,438
for a homicide investigator.

1599
01:00:57,601 --> 01:00:58,705
Dade County
has suddenly become

1600
01:00:58,869 --> 01:01:00,610
the murder capital
of the United States.

1601
01:01:00,771 --> 01:01:02,614
Dade County, Florida,
has recorded

1602
01:01:02,773 --> 01:01:05,515
more than 560 homicides in 1980.

1603
01:01:05,642 --> 01:01:08,145
[Davis] In no time at all,
we had bodies on the floor,

1604
01:01:08,312 --> 01:01:10,849
we had them stacked up.
It was a disgrace.

1605
01:01:10,981 --> 01:01:13,552
Well, it's pretty bad. In fact, it's
probably the worst I've ever seen.

1606
01:01:13,717 --> 01:01:16,163
We rented a refrigerated truck.

1607
01:01:16,320 --> 01:01:18,698
They had rented this
refrigerated trailer truck

1608
01:01:18,822 --> 01:01:21,063
from Burger King
for the overflow of bodies.

1609
01:01:21,191 --> 01:01:24,263
It already had 27 bodies in it
that had come in that day.

1610
01:01:24,428 --> 01:01:26,237
[man] South Floridians
are now buying guns

1611
01:01:26,363 --> 01:01:28,309
and owning more guns
than ever before.

1612
01:01:28,465 --> 01:01:31,537
[Burstyn] We had huge expansion
of gun ranges.

1613
01:01:31,668 --> 01:01:35,946
For a relatively small community,
we had 60 or 70 gun ranges.

1614
01:01:36,140 --> 01:01:39,349
I certainly never traveled anywhere
in Dade County without being armed.

1615
01:01:39,509 --> 01:01:40,954
There's no question
about that.

1616
01:01:41,111 --> 01:01:42,454
I always had a gun.

1617
01:01:42,613 --> 01:01:44,889
I wouldn't sleep well
without one.

1618
01:01:45,015 --> 01:01:48,121
I've had a couple of the Dade County
circuit judges attend my course.

1619
01:01:48,285 --> 01:01:50,458
One of the judges wanted
the firearm under the bench.

1620
01:01:50,621 --> 01:01:51,759
Civilians are killing as many

1621
01:01:51,922 --> 01:01:53,765
suspected criminals
as the police are.

1622
01:01:53,924 --> 01:01:58,634
[man] Citizens have killed 30 of the 43
felons killed in the act of a crime.

1623
01:01:58,796 --> 01:02:03,006
For South Florida a spiraling trend
called "justifiable homicide."

1624
01:02:03,167 --> 01:02:06,637
- Move or stay and fight. Is that it?
- Basically right.

1625
01:02:06,804 --> 01:02:08,943
Violence is being
answered with violence.

1626
01:02:09,072 --> 01:02:12,178
[man] From the housewife to the
businessman, cocaine cowboy,

1627
01:02:12,343 --> 01:02:15,017
and even the attendant
on the corner pumping gas,

1628
01:02:15,178 --> 01:02:17,283
we are all living
in an armed camp.

1629
01:02:17,414 --> 01:02:19,792
It was really dangerous
to be on the street.

1630
01:02:19,950 --> 01:02:23,523
I wouldn't go out by myself
at night if you paid me.

1631
01:02:23,687 --> 01:02:26,497
[man] ls the public adequately
protected right now?

1632
01:02:26,657 --> 01:02:29,797
No. I mean, that's obvious.
We cannot control crime.

1633
01:02:29,960 --> 01:02:32,167
How many good old
fashioned who-done-its

1634
01:02:32,329 --> 01:02:33,501
have you solved this year?

1635
01:02:33,664 --> 01:02:36,304
Probably not more than four.

1636
01:02:36,433 --> 01:02:39,175
We've had had no success
whatsoever to date

1637
01:02:39,336 --> 01:02:40,679
closing a Columbian murder.

1638
01:02:40,837 --> 01:02:45,411
We are totally overwhelmed,
outmanned, outgunned, out-financed.

1639
01:02:45,576 --> 01:02:48,250
And it's just shoveling
sand against the tide.

1640
01:02:48,412 --> 01:02:50,619
Dade County is losing.
Miami is losing.

1641
01:02:50,748 --> 01:02:54,855
Right now, no question, hands down,
they are definitely winning the war.

1642
01:02:55,018 --> 01:02:56,827
[woman] We're losing the battle.

1643
01:02:56,987 --> 01:02:58,967
I mean, we're just
flat out losing.

1644
01:03:00,223 --> 01:03:02,567
[man] There was an article that
appeared in Time Magazine,

1645
01:03:02,726 --> 01:03:05,206
"Paradise Lost," about Miami.

1646
01:03:05,362 --> 01:03:07,842
It recites the problems
that plague South Florida.

1647
01:03:07,998 --> 01:03:10,171
Crime, drugs, refugees.

1648
01:03:10,300 --> 01:03:14,009
[Singleton]
The Paradise Lost Time cover

1649
01:03:14,137 --> 01:03:16,583
seemed to kind of define Miami

1650
01:03:16,740 --> 01:03:19,880
as the most violent city in
the nation at the time. And it was.

1651
01:03:20,044 --> 01:03:24,186
And as Miami got slammed
by the media, tourism dried up.

1652
01:03:25,082 --> 01:03:27,084
[man 1] And everybody thought
Miami is finished.

1653
01:03:28,118 --> 01:03:30,098
[man 2] The bottom-line has been
the scaring way

1654
01:03:30,254 --> 01:03:31,927
of businessmen
and investors.

1655
01:03:32,089 --> 01:03:34,000
[man 3] Business is bad
and as long as new stories

1656
01:03:34,124 --> 01:03:35,865
continue to stream
out of Miami

1657
01:03:36,026 --> 01:03:38,302
about crime and refugees,
it won't get any better.

1658
01:03:38,462 --> 01:03:40,373
With all this going on
in South Dade,

1659
01:03:40,497 --> 01:03:41,874
what are the police
doing about it?

1660
01:03:42,032 --> 01:03:44,876
I wrote up the concept paper
for CENTAC,

1661
01:03:45,035 --> 01:03:47,242
sometime around
December of 1980.

1662
01:03:47,404 --> 01:03:50,078
CENTAC stands for
Central Tactical Unit.

1663
01:03:50,240 --> 01:03:52,151
[man] CENTAC which combines
the efforts

1664
01:03:52,309 --> 01:03:54,220
of a drug enforcement
administration,

1665
01:03:54,344 --> 01:03:57,120
metro homicide and organized
crime bureau units.

1666
01:03:57,280 --> 01:04:01,956
That brought together the monies,
resources of the federal government,

1667
01:04:02,119 --> 01:04:06,864
of DEA and customs, with the
knowledge of local law enforcement

1668
01:04:06,990 --> 01:04:08,765
and state agencies.

1669
01:04:08,926 --> 01:04:11,270
There is a publication
from DEA

1670
01:04:11,428 --> 01:04:14,341
that brings CENTAC
back to "The Untouchables."

1671
01:04:14,498 --> 01:04:17,411
"The Untouchables" was
a CENTAC of its time.

1672
01:04:17,534 --> 01:04:22,779
That kind of aura gave
the officers in CENTAC

1673
01:04:22,940 --> 01:04:25,921
that feeling of being elite
within an elite.

1674
01:04:26,076 --> 01:04:29,353
[man 1] It was the earliest
Miami police taskforce.

1675
01:04:29,513 --> 01:04:33,427
[man 2] Raul Diaz was the Lieutenant
in charge of CENTAC.

1676
01:04:33,550 --> 01:04:36,292
When the opportunity for CENTAC
came around, first I asked Al.

1677
01:04:36,453 --> 01:04:38,626
He was Lieutenant at the time
and I worked for him.

1678
01:04:38,789 --> 01:04:40,666
My relationship
with Al was special.

1679
01:04:40,824 --> 01:04:43,361
An outstanding
homicide investigator.

1680
01:04:43,527 --> 01:04:45,939
He's a cop's cop.
He's a solid cop.

1681
01:04:46,096 --> 01:04:48,542
And it was someone
who had no idea

1682
01:04:48,699 --> 01:04:50,542
what the hell was going
out there in narcotics.

1683
01:04:50,701 --> 01:04:52,078
[Singleton] He became my mentor.

1684
01:04:52,202 --> 01:04:56,150
Best way to describe Raul
is very innovative investigator.

1685
01:04:56,306 --> 01:04:57,444
I'll let it go with that.

1686
01:04:57,574 --> 01:04:59,952
[Buchanan] He felt
the pulse beat of the streets.

1687
01:05:00,110 --> 01:05:01,521
He knew what was going on.

1688
01:05:01,678 --> 01:05:07,390
His strength was knowing people
and dealing with informants.

1689
01:05:07,551 --> 01:05:10,657
[Diaz] We would talk to them in
a language that they understood.

1690
01:05:10,821 --> 01:05:12,459
"You come here
and you do these things,

1691
01:05:12,589 --> 01:05:15,832
we're going to arrest you,
or we're going to kill you,

1692
01:05:15,993 --> 01:05:19,531
or we're going to make
your life a living hell...

1693
01:05:20,697 --> 01:05:22,699
unless you talk to us
and cooperate."

1694
01:05:22,866 --> 01:05:25,107
It's all in the delivery,
if you will.

1695
01:05:25,235 --> 01:05:28,409
And not the physical delivery,
verbal delivery.

1696
01:05:28,572 --> 01:05:30,574
They were among the
busiest people in Dade County.

1697
01:05:30,741 --> 01:05:32,550
Al Singleton
and the CENTAC team.

1698
01:05:32,709 --> 01:05:33,813
[woman] The purpose of CENTAC

1699
01:05:33,977 --> 01:05:36,685
is to solve drug related
homicides involving Latins.

1700
01:05:36,847 --> 01:05:39,987
[Diaz] The goal
of CENTAC 26 was to

1701
01:05:40,150 --> 01:05:42,960
get rid...

1702
01:05:44,388 --> 01:05:48,859
of those people who were actually
participating in the homicides

1703
01:05:49,026 --> 01:05:52,496
and those who were
ordering these murders.

1704
01:05:52,629 --> 01:05:57,374
The top people... Most of the people
responsible, we never get.

1705
01:05:57,534 --> 01:06:02,506
[Diaz] We came up with a list
of about 20 people.

1706
01:06:02,639 --> 01:06:06,018
And what we did was
target these 20 people.

1707
01:06:06,176 --> 01:06:09,419
This place had no lack
of Latin career criminals.

1708
01:06:09,580 --> 01:06:13,255
Our number one person
was Amilcar Rodriguez.

1709
01:06:13,417 --> 01:06:15,454
And the reason for that was
because he was a suspect

1710
01:06:15,619 --> 01:06:21,092
in about 20 homicides. And in three
days, we had our number one target.

1711
01:06:21,258 --> 01:06:24,171
[man] Their biggest catch so far
is Rafael Leon Rodriguez,

1712
01:06:24,294 --> 01:06:25,773
known as Amilcar.

1713
01:06:25,929 --> 01:06:29,638
He is an alleged cocaine distributor
for five Colombian families.

1714
01:06:29,800 --> 01:06:32,644
Amilcar is charged with
a double murder in Dade County,

1715
01:06:32,803 --> 01:06:36,012
and is accused of trying
to kill police on two occasions.

1716
01:06:36,139 --> 01:06:39,643
The arrest of Amilcar
was essentially based upon

1717
01:06:39,810 --> 01:06:43,485
informant information that Raul Diaz
had prior to the homicide.

1718
01:06:43,647 --> 01:06:46,059
We found out that he was
known by several names.

1719
01:06:46,216 --> 01:06:49,129
As we started showing his
photographs to people in the street,

1720
01:06:49,286 --> 01:06:52,563
we came up with something
like 14 or 15 aliases.

1721
01:06:52,689 --> 01:06:56,967
This man had a MAC-10, MAC-11,

1722
01:06:57,127 --> 01:07:01,633
a Smith and Wesson model 59.
This guy had 148 rounds.

1723
01:07:02,466 --> 01:07:05,675
[man] The Columbian assassins are
partial to the MAC-10 machine gun.

1724
01:07:07,838 --> 01:07:11,342
The MAC-10 fires in bursts
of 16 bullets a second.

1725
01:07:11,508 --> 01:07:14,421
[Kaye] They all have guns.
They all carry guns:

1726
01:07:14,544 --> 01:07:17,957
automatic pistols, 14 shot clip.

1727
01:07:18,115 --> 01:07:22,655
My homicide detectives had
72 rounds among all 12 of them.

1728
01:07:22,819 --> 01:07:25,527
[man] And here you're expecting the
policeman to go in and do his job

1729
01:07:25,689 --> 01:07:27,225
and he's carrying
a shot revolver.

1730
01:07:27,357 --> 01:07:31,931
It was decided that since we were
going to be facing these folks,

1731
01:07:32,095 --> 01:07:36,635
that homicide should be allowed
to carry semiautomatics.

1732
01:07:38,135 --> 01:07:40,513
Horse shit.
We'll take it one step beyond.

1733
01:07:40,670 --> 01:07:42,672
Let's get authorized
for machine guns.

1734
01:07:42,839 --> 01:07:47,481
So CENTAC, when we went
operational, we had machine guns.

1735
01:07:52,382 --> 01:07:55,852
[man] I was born in Cali, Colombia,
July 5, 1957.

1736
01:07:57,754 --> 01:08:02,169
I arrived in the United States,
you know, July 5, 1969.

1737
01:08:03,160 --> 01:08:04,332
I was known as a car thief.

1738
01:08:04,494 --> 01:08:06,496
One of the biggest car thieves
in Chicago and then,

1739
01:08:06,663 --> 01:08:10,475
after the 80s', I was known to be
an assassin for the Cartel.

1740
01:08:26,183 --> 01:08:28,424
I went to Chicago
to live with my father.

1741
01:08:28,585 --> 01:08:30,394
He worked for
General Motors.

1742
01:08:30,554 --> 01:08:33,558
I went to a Catholic school,
where I learned English at.

1743
01:08:33,724 --> 01:08:34,828
I was a mechanic, with my dad.

1744
01:08:34,991 --> 01:08:37,130
That's where I learned
how to break into cars.

1745
01:08:37,260 --> 01:08:38,705
I just started
with a group of guys

1746
01:08:38,862 --> 01:08:41,069
and we started stealing cars,
selling them to chop shops.

1747
01:08:41,231 --> 01:08:42,710
Between $200
and $500 a car.

1748
01:08:42,866 --> 01:08:45,540
We used to steal five, six, a night.
It was three of us.

1749
01:08:45,702 --> 01:08:48,546
So we were making good money.
Better than working for my dad.

1750
01:08:48,705 --> 01:08:50,184
We were in the restaurant
eating breakfast,

1751
01:08:50,340 --> 01:08:52,047
and three Colombians came in.

1752
01:08:52,208 --> 01:08:55,781
One was Cruz Gonzalez,
and he asked, "Who was favorita?"

1753
01:08:55,946 --> 01:08:56,981
We asked him why.
What he was looking for.

1754
01:08:57,113 --> 01:08:59,059
He said, "I'm looking
for the guy who stole my car."

1755
01:08:59,215 --> 01:09:01,627
So I just told him, I said, "I'm that
guy you're looking for. I'm Rivi."

1756
01:09:01,785 --> 01:09:04,061
He says, "You stole my car,
and I want my car back."

1757
01:09:04,221 --> 01:09:05,723
I said, "You can't have it back
unless you gave me $500,

1758
01:09:05,889 --> 01:09:08,233
because it belongs to me now."
He started laughing.

1759
01:09:08,391 --> 01:09:10,735
And he said, "You got some balls,
you know that?"

1760
01:09:10,894 --> 01:09:12,237
I said, "Yeah, I heard that before."

1761
01:09:12,396 --> 01:09:14,205
And he asked me
if I'd ever been to Florida.

1762
01:09:14,364 --> 01:09:16,002
I said, "Yeah, a couple of times."

1763
01:09:16,132 --> 01:09:18,544
He asks me if I've been to Miami.
I said, "Yeah, with my dad."

1764
01:09:18,668 --> 01:09:21,171
He asks me, if I could drive
a truck for him to Florida.

1765
01:09:21,304 --> 01:09:24,114
I said, "Sure. Do I get paid?"
He said, "Yeah" that he would pay me

1766
01:09:24,274 --> 01:09:26,481
$5000 if I drive the truck.
Told him "Yeah, no problem."

1767
01:09:26,643 --> 01:09:28,782
He asked me if I had a driver's license,
I said, "Yeah, I got six of them."

1768
01:09:28,945 --> 01:09:31,892
And we drove the truck. We're driving
smoking weed all the way down.

1769
01:09:32,048 --> 01:09:33,721
And we stopped halfway
because I got curious

1770
01:09:33,850 --> 01:09:35,261
what was in the box.
It was full of boxes.

1771
01:09:35,418 --> 01:09:37,364
We pull over, and I opened
one of the boxes,

1772
01:09:37,487 --> 01:09:38,966
and it was full of guns,
used guns.

1773
01:09:39,122 --> 01:09:41,363
Shotguns, revolvers,
automatic pistols.

1774
01:09:42,259 --> 01:09:45,240
So for now, we just started
driving at speed limit.

1775
01:09:45,595 --> 01:09:47,597
When I got to Miami,
they paid us and he says,

1776
01:09:47,764 --> 01:09:48,970
"Look, I got
some things going.

1777
01:09:49,132 --> 01:09:50,634
Maybe you guys could,
you know, work for me

1778
01:09:50,800 --> 01:09:52,108
and make some more
money in Miami.

1779
01:09:52,269 --> 01:09:53,907
If you could stay at Miami."
I told him, "Doing what?"

1780
01:09:54,071 --> 01:09:56,210
He said, "Just delivering dope
and picking up money.

1781
01:09:56,339 --> 01:09:58,683
Maybe once in a while
push somebody around."

1782
01:09:58,842 --> 01:10:00,446
We decided to stay
for a couple of weeks.

1783
01:10:00,610 --> 01:10:03,216
So when he told me just to
watch one of his stash houses,

1784
01:10:03,346 --> 01:10:06,691
that was the first time
we were working with people

1785
01:10:06,850 --> 01:10:10,297
that were in the drug business.
But later on they were pussy cats.

1786
01:10:10,454 --> 01:10:16,166
After we learned our own... the trade
and we learned how to use guns

1787
01:10:16,326 --> 01:10:19,637
and we met different people,
they were nobody.

1788
01:10:19,796 --> 01:10:23,266
They were pussy cats, boy scouts.

1789
01:10:23,433 --> 01:10:27,313
Cruz had an ex-military,
an old man.

1790
01:10:27,470 --> 01:10:29,780
As soon as I met him,
I liked the guy.

1791
01:10:29,906 --> 01:10:32,318
And he started telling me he was
in the military for so many years

1792
01:10:32,476 --> 01:10:35,514
and he was a demolition expert.

1793
01:10:35,679 --> 01:10:38,717
So I started asking him a lot of
questions about explosives,

1794
01:10:39,316 --> 01:10:41,159
and automatic weapons.

1795
01:10:41,318 --> 01:10:44,162
So I went into the next room
and got one. it was a MAC-10.

1796
01:10:44,321 --> 01:10:46,358
I said I want to know
how to take it apart, clean it.

1797
01:10:46,523 --> 01:10:49,299
We started going to the Everglades,
shooting our machine guns.

1798
01:10:49,459 --> 01:10:51,302
I learned.
I got pretty good at all this.

1799
01:10:51,461 --> 01:10:53,998
From the first day
I had a MAC-11 in my hand,

1800
01:10:54,164 --> 01:10:56,371
I knew that was my favorite
choice of weapon.

1801
01:10:56,533 --> 01:10:58,638
Then he says, "You want to learn
how to use explosives?"

1802
01:10:58,769 --> 01:11:01,750
I said, "Yeah."
He said, "You got good nerves?"

1803
01:11:01,905 --> 01:11:03,680
I said, "Pretty steady."

1804
01:11:05,041 --> 01:11:08,022
He says, "We have some dynamite
coming from Texas in a few days,

1805
01:11:08,178 --> 01:11:09,555
I'm gonna teach you
how to make bombs."

1806
01:11:09,713 --> 01:11:12,193
The next day the dynamite
arrived with the detonators.

1807
01:11:12,349 --> 01:11:15,193
He took four sticks of
dynamite and detonators.

1808
01:11:15,352 --> 01:11:16,558
He started just going through it,

1809
01:11:16,720 --> 01:11:18,495
you know, basically
showing me how to do it.

1810
01:11:18,755 --> 01:11:21,133
About two hours later,
he says, "Can you build one?"

1811
01:11:21,257 --> 01:11:25,569
I said, "I think so."
So I did.

1812
01:11:25,729 --> 01:11:29,302
I said, "The only thing that it needs
is just to plug it to the battery

1813
01:11:29,432 --> 01:11:30,570
and to the timer."

1814
01:11:31,368 --> 01:11:32,745
He said, "Can you do that?"

1815
01:11:32,903 --> 01:11:34,348
You know, I mean,
my kids are sleeping.

1816
01:11:34,504 --> 01:11:37,212
In the next room, my wife.
And he went, "Just try me."

1817
01:11:37,374 --> 01:11:39,411
I said, "Sure, how much time
do you want out of it?"

1818
01:11:39,576 --> 01:11:41,146
He said, "About 30 seconds.
Go ahead."

1819
01:11:41,277 --> 01:11:44,224
And I did.
We let the clock run.

1820
01:11:44,381 --> 01:11:45,917
He was sitting in front of me.

1821
01:11:46,082 --> 01:11:48,153
About 10 seconds went by, 15...

1822
01:11:48,919 --> 01:11:50,523
He says, "You know in another
10 seconds it's gonna go off."

1823
01:11:50,654 --> 01:11:51,860
I said, "I know.
Do you want me to shut it off,

1824
01:11:51,988 --> 01:11:53,797
or you want to shut it off?

1825
01:11:53,957 --> 01:11:57,029
So he smiled,
and he put a plug on it.

1826
01:11:57,260 --> 01:12:00,264
Then he says,
"You're good at it.

1827
01:12:00,430 --> 01:12:02,239
Just make sure
that when you're doing it,

1828
01:12:02,399 --> 01:12:07,781
don't be on drugs, don't drink
because you'll blow your kids up."

1829
01:12:07,938 --> 01:12:11,579
A couple weeks went by and we
were in a night club, in Miami.

1830
01:12:11,741 --> 01:12:12,583
Flaco came in.

1831
01:12:12,742 --> 01:12:15,052
He says, "Look, you know,
we need to get out of here,

1832
01:12:15,212 --> 01:12:16,714
because there's going
to be a hit here.

1833
01:12:16,846 --> 01:12:19,053
You need to get you people out.
Those people on your right...

1834
01:12:19,216 --> 01:12:21,628
And six Colombians laughing
and drinking fire water.

1835
01:12:21,785 --> 01:12:24,288
You want to spray that table.
The whole table.

1836
01:12:24,454 --> 01:12:26,991
And I said, "All right, I appreciate
it. I said "Let me get my guys."

1837
01:12:27,157 --> 01:12:28,363
I went back to bathroom,

1838
01:12:28,491 --> 01:12:29,595
and I told him,
I said, "We got to go.

1839
01:12:29,759 --> 01:12:32,262
There's going to be a shootout here."
He says, "Just give me a minute."

1840
01:12:32,429 --> 01:12:33,999
I walked out.
Well, during that time,

1841
01:12:34,164 --> 01:12:36,440
Venegas had stopped
at the same table, by accident,

1842
01:12:36,599 --> 01:12:37,771
and told the guys to leave

1843
01:12:37,968 --> 01:12:39,470
because there was
gonna be a shootout.

1844
01:12:39,636 --> 01:12:41,741
So he screwed up the hit.
It was just an accident.

1845
01:12:41,872 --> 01:12:43,374
I found out he knew
one of the guys at the table,

1846
01:12:43,506 --> 01:12:44,746
so he was just looking out
for his friend,

1847
01:12:44,875 --> 01:12:46,411
told him to leave because it was
going to be a shooting.

1848
01:12:46,576 --> 01:12:49,489
I was outside.
Venegas came out.

1849
01:12:49,646 --> 01:12:51,319
Behind Venegas
everybody is coming.

1850
01:12:51,481 --> 01:12:52,960
They started pushing each other out.

1851
01:12:53,116 --> 01:12:55,221
Flaco came on his motorcycle.
He was really pissed off.

1852
01:12:55,352 --> 01:12:56,695
He said, "You guys
fucked everything up.

1853
01:12:56,853 --> 01:12:58,025
I should have
never told you nothing."

1854
01:12:58,188 --> 01:13:00,031
I said, "Yeah, we did it, man,
you know, it was an accident."

1855
01:13:00,190 --> 01:13:01,692
He says,
"Well, you're in trouble, man,

1856
01:13:01,858 --> 01:13:03,030
you know you're in trouble
with my boss.

1857
01:13:03,193 --> 01:13:05,833
The boss wants to meet you."
I said, "No problem."

1858
01:13:05,996 --> 01:13:08,704
So we get in the car,
we got on I-95...

1859
01:13:08,865 --> 01:13:10,401
And on the way,
I'm telling him, I said,

1860
01:13:10,534 --> 01:13:11,638
"These people
aren't gonna kill me, are they?

1861
01:13:11,801 --> 01:13:14,304
He says, "I don't know,
I don't make no guarantees, man."

1862
01:13:14,471 --> 01:13:16,007
We have fucked
something up here.

1863
01:13:16,172 --> 01:13:17,446
I mean, they talk about
killing six people.

1864
01:13:17,607 --> 01:13:19,848
So you know
there ain't no pussies here.

1865
01:13:20,009 --> 01:13:23,252
So we drove to a Holiday Inn
on I-95, in Miami.

1866
01:13:23,913 --> 01:13:26,826
I looked, and four guys
got out of a car.

1867
01:13:26,983 --> 01:13:28,963
I Said, "Oh, is that them?"

1868
01:13:29,085 --> 01:13:30,120
He said, "That's them,
that's part of them.

1869
01:13:30,286 --> 01:13:31,196
That's more to your left."

1870
01:13:31,354 --> 01:13:32,458
And I look,
and there was four other guys

1871
01:13:32,622 --> 01:13:34,192
on the other side,
getting off the car.

1872
01:13:34,357 --> 01:13:37,031
I approached
the older guy who was there.

1873
01:13:37,193 --> 01:13:39,366
He says, "Are you Rivi?"
I said, "Yes, I am."

1874
01:13:39,529 --> 01:13:42,601
He says, "Come with me."

1875
01:13:42,732 --> 01:13:45,975
I got on back of a car,
and in the backseat there was a lady.

1876
01:13:46,102 --> 01:13:46,978
And she asked me.
She said,

1877
01:13:47,103 --> 01:13:48,810
"You the one who fucked up
the hit last night?"

1878
01:13:48,939 --> 01:13:50,646
And I said, "In a way I did."

1879
01:13:50,840 --> 01:13:54,686
And she told me, "I'd been after
these people for months,

1880
01:13:54,844 --> 01:13:58,314
and this is only the first time
that we got sight on them."

1881
01:13:58,481 --> 01:14:00,188
And that I had fucked it up.

1882
01:14:00,350 --> 01:14:02,762
She says,
"Well, I'll tell you what.

1883
01:14:02,919 --> 01:14:05,297
You find them
and we call it even.

1884
01:14:05,422 --> 01:14:06,765
I'm interested
in the two brothers.

1885
01:14:06,923 --> 01:14:07,993
The other four
we were just gonna hit

1886
01:14:08,124 --> 01:14:09,159
because they were sitting
at the table."

1887
01:14:09,325 --> 01:14:11,532
I said, "You were gonna kill
four other people just to kill two?"

1888
01:14:11,694 --> 01:14:13,537
She said,
"That's the way I do my things:

1889
01:14:13,697 --> 01:14:15,574
Get everybody out of the way."

1890
01:14:16,433 --> 01:14:18,344
I said, "Wouldn't it be easier
just to kill two?"

1891
01:14:18,501 --> 01:14:21,345
She said, "No, it would have
been easier to kill all six of them.

1892
01:14:22,038 --> 01:14:24,780
Spray the whole table instead
of walking up to one a piece."

1893
01:14:24,941 --> 01:14:26,318
That surprised me, you know.

1894
01:14:26,443 --> 01:14:29,014
I mean she's talking
to murder like...

1895
01:14:29,145 --> 01:14:30,647
So I told her, I said,
"Just give me a week,

1896
01:14:30,780 --> 01:14:32,054
I'll find these people."

1897
01:14:32,215 --> 01:14:34,058
So when we got back
to the hotel,

1898
01:14:34,217 --> 01:14:36,754
I told the guys what happened,
and Venegas was there.

1899
01:14:36,920 --> 01:14:37,921
And I said, "What happened?"
I said, "Look,

1900
01:14:38,088 --> 01:14:39,658
we're in deep shit
with this lady.

1901
01:14:39,789 --> 01:14:42,326
If we don't find this people,
we're gonna have to haul ass.

1902
01:14:42,459 --> 01:14:44,268
Because they're gonna come after,
they told me in so many words."

1903
01:14:44,427 --> 01:14:45,701
He said, "He's a friend of mine,
I know him."

1904
01:14:45,829 --> 01:14:48,275
I said, "You know him? So you can
get a hold him?" He said, "Yeah."

1905
01:14:48,431 --> 01:14:49,933
I said, "if you can get
a hold of him,

1906
01:14:50,099 --> 01:14:51,271
then we got this under control."

1907
01:14:51,434 --> 01:14:52,606
He said, "Yeah,
we can get hold of them.

1908
01:14:52,769 --> 01:14:53,804
One, the older one."

1909
01:14:53,970 --> 01:14:55,972
I said, "That's what we need, one.

1910
01:14:56,139 --> 01:14:57,117
To hell with the other one."

1911
01:14:57,273 --> 01:14:59,913
I said "Do this.
Let's go to a pay phone

1912
01:15:00,076 --> 01:15:03,080
and beep him,
and set up a meeting for tonight.

1913
01:15:03,246 --> 01:15:04,350
And we're gonna kidnap his ass

1914
01:15:04,481 --> 01:15:06,427
And we're gonna turn it over
to this other people."

1915
01:15:06,583 --> 01:15:08,688
He beeped and the guy answered.

1916
01:15:08,818 --> 01:15:12,265
He set up a meeting
at the Ramada Inn back parking lot.

1917
01:15:12,422 --> 01:15:14,800
He told him that we had some guns
and some explosives for sale.

1918
01:15:14,958 --> 01:15:15,902
Sure enough the guy came in.

1919
01:15:16,025 --> 01:15:17,766
By <i>8</i> o'clock, it was already dark.

1920
01:15:17,927 --> 01:15:19,429
He's talking,
laughing with Venegas.

1921
01:15:19,596 --> 01:15:21,906
I'm behind a tree.
And Venegas opened the trunk,

1922
01:15:22,032 --> 01:15:23,841
I came out behind the tree,
I put a gun in his ribs,

1923
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:25,172
"I've been looking for you."

1924
01:15:25,335 --> 01:15:26,245
So the guy says,
"I owe you nothing."

1925
01:15:26,402 --> 01:15:28,109
I said, "No, you don't.
Someone else needs you.

1926
01:15:28,271 --> 01:15:30,308
There's a lady looking for you.

1927
01:15:30,473 --> 01:15:32,783
Her name is Griselda Blanco."
He turned white.

1928
01:15:32,942 --> 01:15:35,718
He said, "You want me to meet
her in couple of hours?"

1929
01:15:35,845 --> 01:15:38,485
He started shaking.

1930
01:15:38,648 --> 01:15:40,457
So about an hour later, they arrived.
They took him.

1931
01:15:41,584 --> 01:15:44,258
The next day I'm at home.
It's 4 o'clock in the afternoon.

1932
01:15:44,421 --> 01:15:46,924
She comes to my house.
My wife was frying fish,

1933
01:15:47,057 --> 01:15:50,504
so she just knocks and comes in
like she owns the house.

1934
01:15:50,660 --> 01:15:54,506
She says I love fish, so I told
my wife to fry her fish.

1935
01:15:54,664 --> 01:15:57,577
She's eating, telling me
how they killed this guy

1936
01:15:57,701 --> 01:15:59,112
and chopped him
up into little pieces

1937
01:15:59,235 --> 01:16:00,305
while we were having dinner.

1938
01:16:01,237 --> 01:16:03,513
I said, "What are you talking about?
You shot this guy?"

1939
01:16:03,673 --> 01:16:05,050
She said, "Yeah, I shot him.

1940
01:16:05,208 --> 01:16:08,519
And then Tulio and Cubamba
cut him up

1941
01:16:08,678 --> 01:16:11,124
and put him in a small box,

1942
01:16:11,247 --> 01:16:13,659
and wrapped him up like a gift
with a little bow on top,

1943
01:16:13,816 --> 01:16:16,319
and we left it a couple blocks
from here, on the Turnpike."

1944
01:16:16,486 --> 01:16:17,624
I said,
"In my neighborhood?"

1945
01:16:17,787 --> 01:16:20,825
She said, "Yeah, we were heading
south to come and visit you,

1946
01:16:20,990 --> 01:16:22,901
so we figured it was
a good spot to drop him off.

1947
01:16:23,059 --> 01:16:24,197
We dropped him off
in Turnpike."

1948
01:16:25,829 --> 01:16:27,240
I said,
"You guys usually do that?"

1949
01:16:27,397 --> 01:16:28,535
She said, "Yeah."
She likes it.

1950
01:16:28,698 --> 01:16:31,440
She likes us to cut people up
and just throw them like that.

1951
01:16:34,370 --> 01:16:36,008
[man] CENTAC is also hoping
to untangle

1952
01:16:36,172 --> 01:16:38,709
the drug organizations
of Griselda Blanco,

1953
01:16:38,875 --> 01:16:41,378
a flamboyant woman nicknamed
by the Colombian newspapers

1954
01:16:41,544 --> 01:16:43,820
La Madrifia or Godmother.

1955
01:16:43,947 --> 01:16:46,086
[Singleton] Well, we can't say for
sure exactly when she was in Miami.

1956
01:16:46,249 --> 01:16:48,525
Probably '78.
We didn't know where, obviously,

1957
01:16:48,685 --> 01:16:49,789
because she was a fugitive.

1958
01:16:49,919 --> 01:16:51,694
And we knew
she was a multi-kilo dealer.

1959
01:16:51,854 --> 01:16:53,060
[Ayala]
She was the biggest back then.

1960
01:16:53,223 --> 01:16:56,466
She was Godmother
of the cocaine trade.

1961
01:16:56,593 --> 01:16:59,369
Bloody, dramatic,
took no prisoners.

1962
01:16:59,529 --> 01:17:01,566
[man] She is suspected
of up to 15 murders

1963
01:17:01,731 --> 01:17:02,709
and now is in hiding.

1964
01:17:02,866 --> 01:17:06,712
[Singleton] 1979, '80, '81
and '82, those were the years

1965
01:17:06,870 --> 01:17:09,908
where she did her killing
in Dade County.

1966
01:17:10,073 --> 01:17:13,077
[Diaz] In the very, very
Latino culture,

1967
01:17:13,243 --> 01:17:14,950
it's not usual

1968
01:17:15,111 --> 01:17:19,253
that a woman would be the head
of her own organization.

1969
01:17:19,415 --> 01:17:24,660
So I figured that she had
to have been one mean lady.

1970
01:17:24,787 --> 01:17:26,824
She's considered
a very dangerous woman.

1971
01:17:26,956 --> 01:17:30,028
She will pull the trigger herself
if given the chance.

1972
01:17:30,160 --> 01:17:31,537
[man] Police say Griselda Blanco

1973
01:17:31,694 --> 01:17:33,674
began years ago
as a bank robber,

1974
01:17:33,797 --> 01:17:35,435
then entered
the drug trade working

1975
01:17:35,598 --> 01:17:36,736
and killing
her way to the top.

1976
01:17:36,899 --> 01:17:40,847
The role of Griselda Blanco
became very, very prominent

1977
01:17:40,970 --> 01:17:43,211
in what we were calling
the cocaine wars.

1978
01:17:43,339 --> 01:17:46,684
[Singleton] The first homicide
of note that she was involved with

1979
01:17:46,809 --> 01:17:49,289
was Dadeland,
which of course was July of 1979.

1980
01:17:49,445 --> 01:17:52,119
Police believed the Dadeland
shootout was simply payback

1981
01:17:52,281 --> 01:17:54,693
for another incident,
here on the Florida Turnpike.

1982
01:17:54,817 --> 01:17:55,955
The infamous highway shooting

1983
01:17:56,119 --> 01:17:57,928
where people
were going down the highway

1984
01:17:58,087 --> 01:18:00,533
shooting at each other,
those two killings are linked.

1985
01:18:00,657 --> 01:18:01,567
Three months before Dadeland,

1986
01:18:01,724 --> 01:18:03,726
two carloads
of Colombian traffickers

1987
01:18:03,893 --> 01:18:05,998
got into a high speed
machine gun shootout here.

1988
01:18:06,162 --> 01:18:08,608
When police finally stopped
one of the two cars,

1989
01:18:08,765 --> 01:18:11,006
they looked in the truck
and found a body,

1990
01:18:11,167 --> 01:18:13,238
handcuffed and strangled
to death.

1991
01:18:13,369 --> 01:18:15,246
Police believe the victim,
Jaime Susco,

1992
01:18:15,371 --> 01:18:17,612
was ordered killed
by German Jimenez,

1993
01:18:17,774 --> 01:18:20,015
the man who died at Dadeland.

1994
01:18:20,176 --> 01:18:22,281
[man 1] There are many people
who paid the price

1995
01:18:22,445 --> 01:18:24,982
because they fell out of favor
with Griselda Blanco.

1996
01:18:25,148 --> 01:18:27,321
There was an infamous case
linked to her.

1997
01:18:27,483 --> 01:18:29,190
[man 2] Police suspect
in November 1980

1998
01:18:29,352 --> 01:18:32,424
during morning rush hour traffic,
near a Miami airport hotel,

1999
01:18:32,588 --> 01:18:34,590
the Godmother's assassins
killed a woman

2000
01:18:34,757 --> 01:18:36,600
named Graciela Gomez.

2001
01:18:36,759 --> 01:18:40,172
Graciela Gomez ran afoul
of the Godmother.

2002
01:18:40,329 --> 01:18:41,899
Not a good thing to do.

2003
01:18:42,031 --> 01:18:45,604
Grizelda was jealous of her, because
she was an attractive young female.

2004
01:18:45,768 --> 01:18:48,271
[man] informants say Gomez
had stolen some cocaine,

2005
01:18:48,404 --> 01:18:51,044
and had a romantic fling
with the Godmother's lover--

2006
01:18:51,207 --> 01:18:53,209
[Singleton] --It might
have been something with--

2007
01:18:53,376 --> 01:18:54,684
Both fatal mistakes.

2008
01:18:54,844 --> 01:18:57,324
She was in a Corvette,
northbound on Red road.

2009
01:18:57,480 --> 01:19:00,484
Stopped at a red light.
Griselda's hitman, Cubamba,

2010
01:19:00,650 --> 01:19:02,630
and this guy named Zapata,
they were following her.

2011
01:19:02,785 --> 01:19:05,129
And she knew they were following her.
She recognized them.

2012
01:19:05,254 --> 01:19:06,699
[man] As Gomez drove in her Corvette,

2013
01:19:06,856 --> 01:19:08,995
shots were fired
from a passing car.

2014
01:19:09,158 --> 01:19:10,296
The shots missed.

2015
01:19:10,426 --> 01:19:12,963
[Singleton] She got afraid,
and she jumped out of her vehicle,

2016
01:19:13,096 --> 01:19:15,474
went to a vehicle
stopped in traffic

2017
01:19:15,632 --> 01:19:17,669
in front of her, pleading for help.

2018
01:19:17,834 --> 01:19:18,812
This couple, man and wife,

2019
01:19:18,968 --> 01:19:20,948
allowed her to get
in the backseat of the vehicle,

2020
01:19:21,070 --> 01:19:22,310
not knowing what was going on.

2021
01:19:22,438 --> 01:19:24,782
[man] As the astonished couple
watched in horror,

2022
01:19:24,907 --> 01:19:27,046
the assassin walked up
to their passenger window,

2023
01:19:27,210 --> 01:19:28,245
pushed them aside

2024
01:19:28,411 --> 01:19:30,482
and fired point blank
into the backseat.

2025
01:19:30,680 --> 01:19:32,956
Shot through the window,
killing Graciela

2026
01:19:33,082 --> 01:19:35,255
in the backseat of this couple's car.

2027
01:19:35,418 --> 01:19:37,864
[Potter] Then they walked
back to their car.

2028
01:19:38,021 --> 01:19:39,500
They didn't run
back to their car.

2029
01:19:39,655 --> 01:19:42,033
Witnesses said they walked
back to their car.

2030
01:19:42,191 --> 01:19:43,829
[man] The couple meantime
scrambled from the car

2031
01:19:43,993 --> 01:19:45,267
to escape physical harm.

2032
01:19:45,428 --> 01:19:47,408
But there was
an emotional toll.

2033
01:19:47,563 --> 01:19:49,565
[Hawkins] The wife felt the gun
to the back of her head.

2034
01:19:49,732 --> 01:19:51,370
She came very close to death.

2035
01:19:51,534 --> 01:19:52,911
That's not the kind of thing
that you expect

2036
01:19:53,069 --> 01:19:55,174
at 7:30 in the morning
to have to deal with.

2037
01:19:55,304 --> 01:19:57,648
I recall that the wife

2038
01:19:57,774 --> 01:19:59,219
just never could really
get over it.

2039
01:19:59,375 --> 01:20:00,752
I think they even relocated

2040
01:20:00,910 --> 01:20:02,583
and moved out of Miami
as a result of that.

2041
01:20:02,745 --> 01:20:06,591
It just showed how brazen
these assassins were,

2042
01:20:06,749 --> 01:20:08,057
and the traffickers
were in Miami.

2043
01:20:08,217 --> 01:20:10,219
They thought they could do
anything in the town.

2044
01:20:10,386 --> 01:20:12,195
And in many cases they did.

2045
01:20:12,321 --> 01:20:14,562
[man] The search
for the assailants continues.

2046
01:20:14,724 --> 01:20:17,136
It is hoped fingerprints
and eyewitness accounts

2047
01:20:17,293 --> 01:20:18,772
will lead to the two men.

2048
01:20:18,928 --> 01:20:21,875
And they were like brazen,
ha ha, you can't catch me.

2049
01:20:22,031 --> 01:20:24,238
It works in a way
like the Wild West.

2050
01:20:24,400 --> 01:20:26,778
I guess that's why they call
them Cocaine Cowboys.

2051
01:20:26,936 --> 01:20:29,780
[man] Bob Kaye, Dade County's
chief prosecutor for homicide,

2052
01:20:29,939 --> 01:20:32,852
has his own definition
for a cocaine cowboy.

2053
01:20:32,976 --> 01:20:34,614
"He is a Colombian,"
Kaye says,

2054
01:20:34,777 --> 01:20:37,121
"usually an illegal alien
who is in South Florida

2055
01:20:37,280 --> 01:20:39,886
either to smuggle drugs
or to settle a score."

2056
01:20:40,049 --> 01:20:41,619
Police believe
all of these people

2057
01:20:41,784 --> 01:20:43,491
are in and out
of Miami regularly.

2058
01:20:43,653 --> 01:20:45,690
I represented
quite a bit of them.

2059
01:20:45,821 --> 01:20:48,165
They used to come in to my office,

2060
01:20:48,324 --> 01:20:52,397
like they used to drive like
a caravan of Mercedes Benz.

2061
01:20:52,528 --> 01:20:55,475
You know, people with guns...
You know, you wonder...

2062
01:20:55,632 --> 01:20:59,273
They were like, like rolling
probable cause on the street.

2063
01:20:59,435 --> 01:21:04,282
There was a rogue cast of
characters involved with Griselda.

2064
01:21:04,440 --> 01:21:06,181
- She had an army with her.
- She had Paco.

2065
01:21:06,342 --> 01:21:07,286
[Singleton] Paco Sepulveda.

2066
01:21:07,443 --> 01:21:08,888
- Diego Sepulveda.
- [Ayala] Toto.

2067
01:21:09,011 --> 01:21:10,922
[Singleton] Carlos Venegas.
Alonso Ayala.

2068
01:21:11,080 --> 01:21:12,957
- [Ayala] Hugo.
- [Singleton] Guillermo Velazquez.

2069
01:21:13,116 --> 01:21:14,959
- [Ayala] Cubamba.
- [Singleton] Manteco.

2070
01:21:15,117 --> 01:21:17,825
- Diego Escobar. Oscar Mario.
- [Ayala] Jaime Bravo.

2071
01:21:17,987 --> 01:21:20,365
They would do
whatever they were told to do

2072
01:21:20,523 --> 01:21:23,436
but they were
mainly enforcerslhitmen.

2073
01:21:23,559 --> 01:21:25,505
Basically, security.

2074
01:21:25,661 --> 01:21:30,167
Riverito... He became Griselda's
most favorite enforcer.

2075
01:21:30,333 --> 01:21:32,313
She had enemies.
Some who owe her money,

2076
01:21:32,468 --> 01:21:34,607
some who had kidnapped
her kids in Colombia,

2077
01:21:34,770 --> 01:21:36,477
some of them have
flipped on her, ripped her off.

2078
01:21:36,639 --> 01:21:39,950
She don't forget or forgive.
She will get you.

2079
01:21:40,109 --> 01:21:41,520
Sooner or later,
she came after you.

2080
01:21:42,145 --> 01:21:43,954
The list was specific...

2081
01:21:44,113 --> 01:21:46,821
the people that she wanted
to get killed. All hits.

2082
01:21:46,983 --> 01:21:48,553
You know,
it's a very long list,

2083
01:21:48,718 --> 01:21:51,528
and it had a price
for each person.

2084
01:21:51,687 --> 01:21:53,997
Oscar Piedrahita
used to work for Griselda.

2085
01:21:54,156 --> 01:21:57,501
He used to be in charge
all the exportation for her.

2086
01:21:57,660 --> 01:21:59,230
But one time came
that he kidnapped

2087
01:21:59,395 --> 01:22:01,466
one of her kids,
Oswaldo, in Colombia.

2088
01:22:01,597 --> 01:22:04,339
And he demanded $5 million, cash,
for returning her son.

2089
01:22:04,500 --> 01:22:05,570
I think she gave him
$1 million dollars,

2090
01:22:05,735 --> 01:22:07,180
and he released the kid.

2091
01:22:07,336 --> 01:22:09,543
Well, he disappeared.
When I started working for her,

2092
01:22:09,705 --> 01:22:12,242
she mentioned the guy,
on the top five.

2093
01:22:12,408 --> 01:22:14,149
And she said,
"if you ever find him,

2094
01:22:14,277 --> 01:22:16,018
I want his ass,
I want you to kill him."

2095
01:22:16,178 --> 01:22:17,885
And every day I used
to read the newspaper.

2096
01:22:18,047 --> 01:22:19,788
And I'd read The Miami Herald

2097
01:22:19,916 --> 01:22:21,395
and I came to the obituaries.

2098
01:22:21,617 --> 01:22:23,688
There was a little article

2099
01:22:23,853 --> 01:22:26,231
about a kid who
had drowned in a pool.

2100
01:22:26,389 --> 01:22:28,892
They were having a wake
in their home on Miami Lakes

2101
01:22:29,058 --> 01:22:32,437
and in the bottom of the article,
it said Oscar Piedrahita,

2102
01:22:32,595 --> 01:22:35,337
the father,
and the address of the house.

2103
01:22:35,464 --> 01:22:38,445
I started thinking,
"it's too easy."

2104
01:22:38,601 --> 01:22:40,581
So I got in my car,
drove up, I called Griselda

2105
01:22:40,736 --> 01:22:42,147
and said,
"I think we need to talk."

2106
01:22:42,271 --> 01:22:43,443
I explained to her,
and showed her the article.

2107
01:22:43,606 --> 01:22:44,550
It might be him,

2108
01:22:44,707 --> 01:22:47,085
but I need somebody to show him
to me if he's the right guy.

2109
01:22:47,243 --> 01:22:49,018
She said, "I got somebody
who knows him really well."

2110
01:22:49,178 --> 01:22:51,988
About 5:30, 6 o'clock,
we went to the address.

2111
01:22:52,114 --> 01:22:53,388
She's with me.

2112
01:22:53,549 --> 01:22:55,460
Dario is driving,
she's on the passenger side

2113
01:22:55,618 --> 01:22:58,098
and I'm in the backseat.
We got three different cars.

2114
01:22:58,254 --> 01:22:59,733
Chicho is in one of them
with Manteco.

2115
01:22:59,889 --> 01:23:01,368
He's the one that's
going to point him out.

2116
01:23:01,490 --> 01:23:03,993
So we drive by and we see all
these people outside the door,

2117
01:23:04,126 --> 01:23:05,434
outside in the front lawn.

2118
01:23:05,595 --> 01:23:07,302
We went around the block
and I got out of the car

2119
01:23:07,463 --> 01:23:10,103
and I spoke to Manteco
and Oscar and Chicho.

2120
01:23:10,266 --> 01:23:11,643
So they ask me,
"How do you want to do this?"

2121
01:23:11,801 --> 01:23:13,075
I said, "it's real simple.

2122
01:23:13,235 --> 01:23:14,839
Everybody's crying,
everybody's hurt,

2123
01:23:14,971 --> 01:23:17,713
just pull up to the front
and ask for him.

2124
01:23:17,873 --> 01:23:19,477
When he comes out,
just hit him."

2125
01:23:19,642 --> 01:23:21,246
They double back
and they go and park and--

2126
01:23:21,410 --> 01:23:23,253
Pull up in front of the house,
and Chicho asks for him,

2127
01:23:23,413 --> 01:23:24,391
There was a lady.

2128
01:23:24,513 --> 01:23:26,186
She said, "Yeah, hold on
a second, let me get him."

2129
01:23:26,315 --> 01:23:28,056
He comes out
a few minutes later.

2130
01:23:28,217 --> 01:23:31,061
He went around to the driveway.
And when he did,

2131
01:23:31,220 --> 01:23:33,200
Chicho's machine gun
was out there, next to the car.

2132
01:23:33,322 --> 01:23:34,960
Everybody just was screaming...

2133
01:23:35,124 --> 01:23:38,401
And then we just went
into I-26, and went home.

2134
01:23:38,528 --> 01:23:40,565
Made the newspaper
front page and stuff.

2135
01:23:40,696 --> 01:23:43,108
[man] When assassins killed
Oscar Piedrahita,

2136
01:23:43,266 --> 01:23:45,075
they put more bullets
in his garage door

2137
01:23:45,234 --> 01:23:46,338
than they put in him.

2138
01:23:46,502 --> 01:23:49,813
It was sad
the way he had to die,

2139
01:23:49,972 --> 01:23:51,474
you know, at his son's wake.

2140
01:23:51,640 --> 01:23:55,087
But he chose that
when he messed with this lady.

2141
01:23:55,244 --> 01:23:57,281
I could have got him later,
2 or 3 days later,

2142
01:23:57,446 --> 01:23:59,050
but that's not
that what she wanted.

2143
01:23:59,181 --> 01:24:02,253
It was kind of sad, you know,
but business is business.

2144
01:24:04,687 --> 01:24:08,100
Miguel Perez and Nestor Garcia were
dope dealers. They were partners.

2145
01:24:08,257 --> 01:24:10,897
Griselda's youngest
kid, Oswaldo.

2146
01:24:11,027 --> 01:24:14,008
He fronted them some dope
that was $250 an ounce I believe.

2147
01:24:14,163 --> 01:24:15,471
They start jerking him around,

2148
01:24:15,631 --> 01:24:16,837
because they just thought
that he was so young.

2149
01:24:16,999 --> 01:24:19,377
They didn't realized
who was behind the kid,

2150
01:24:19,535 --> 01:24:20,707
and they jerked him around.

2151
01:24:20,870 --> 01:24:22,816
Finally they just told him
that they wouldn't pay him,

2152
01:24:22,972 --> 01:24:24,246
to go fuck himself.

2153
01:24:24,373 --> 01:24:26,148
He just figured,
"Well, fuck him,

2154
01:24:26,309 --> 01:24:27,617
you know,
he ain't gonna find me."

2155
01:24:27,743 --> 01:24:29,120
But he figured wrong.

2156
01:24:29,278 --> 01:24:31,622
Oswaldo went back to his mom
and told her. I was at her house,

2157
01:24:31,747 --> 01:24:32,817
when he was telling
her the story.

2158
01:24:32,982 --> 01:24:35,986
Griselda told me,
"Find him and kill him."

2159
01:24:36,152 --> 01:24:37,927
So I started questioning
Oswaldo about it.

2160
01:24:38,054 --> 01:24:39,089
Tell me where you met
this guy.

2161
01:24:39,222 --> 01:24:41,998
He says, "He told me
that he works at a drug store."

2162
01:24:42,158 --> 01:24:43,728
"Where?"
He said, "Somewhere in Kendall."

2163
01:24:43,893 --> 01:24:45,497
I said, "I get back
within a few days."

2164
01:24:45,661 --> 01:24:46,935
So I grab a phone book.

2165
01:24:47,063 --> 01:24:48,542
I start to looking through
all the drug stores in Kendall.

2166
01:24:48,697 --> 01:24:51,143
There's a whole bunch of them.
There's just too many of them.

2167
01:24:51,300 --> 01:24:52,210
I went back to him.

2168
01:24:52,368 --> 01:24:55,008
I said, "Do you remember anything
else about that drug store?"

2169
01:24:55,171 --> 01:24:56,980
He said, "Yes,
it's near a police station."

2170
01:24:57,139 --> 01:24:58,482
So I went to a private
investigator friend of mine.

2171
01:24:58,608 --> 01:25:00,315
And I asked him,
"Do you know a drug store

2172
01:25:00,443 --> 01:25:02,946
or a police station
that is near a shopping center?"

2173
01:25:03,079 --> 01:25:07,289
He says, "There's one, you know,
US-1 and 200th Street."

2174
01:25:07,416 --> 01:25:08,827
I said, "No, that's too far down."

2175
01:25:08,984 --> 01:25:09,985
He says, "There's another one

2176
01:25:10,152 --> 01:25:11,722
on Kendall Drive,
near the turnpike."

2177
01:25:11,888 --> 01:25:14,368
So I went to that one.
This is the first one I went to.

2178
01:25:14,523 --> 01:25:16,662
It was 107th
in Kendall Drive,

2179
01:25:16,792 --> 01:25:19,773
and I saw the police station was
right behind the drug store.

2180
01:25:19,929 --> 01:25:21,135
And it was
a Cuban drug store.

2181
01:25:21,264 --> 01:25:24,370
I believed I was in the right track,
so I went and got the kid.

2182
01:25:24,533 --> 01:25:26,911
I said, "Did you meet him near here?"

2183
01:25:27,069 --> 01:25:29,879
He said, "Yeah, I met him at
the Chinese restaurant right there."

2184
01:25:30,039 --> 01:25:31,746
I said, "That's his
drug store right there."

2185
01:25:31,907 --> 01:25:33,887
The next day we set up
surveillance in the drug store...

2186
01:25:34,043 --> 01:25:36,319
All day, with the kid
to show us him.

2187
01:25:36,445 --> 01:25:38,925
I was almost giving up,
that it was the wrong store.

2188
01:25:39,081 --> 01:25:40,526
I was just getting
in the car to leave.

2189
01:25:40,649 --> 01:25:41,889
I had a sniper rifle.

2190
01:25:42,051 --> 01:25:43,587
I was taking it apart.
And then he says,

2191
01:25:43,752 --> 01:25:45,595
"That's him right there."
I said "Who?"

2192
01:25:45,755 --> 01:25:47,200
He said, "That BMW.
That's him right there."

2193
01:25:47,356 --> 01:25:49,734
He pulled up in front of the
drug store with two other guys.

2194
01:25:49,892 --> 01:25:51,235
So he went into the drug store.

2195
01:25:51,394 --> 01:25:52,532
I was telling him
he had to come out.

2196
01:25:52,662 --> 01:25:54,232
Well, about a half
an hour later he came out.

2197
01:25:54,397 --> 01:25:56,707
Then he started walking,
football shorts.

2198
01:25:56,832 --> 01:25:58,903
It was an old Chevy Impala.

2199
01:25:59,068 --> 01:26:00,376
When he reached
into his shorts pocket,

2200
01:26:00,503 --> 01:26:02,608
and he took the key out
and he turned his back on me,

2201
01:26:02,771 --> 01:26:04,751
he must have been not even
five yards away from me,

2202
01:26:04,907 --> 01:26:05,908
where I was parked at.

2203
01:26:06,075 --> 01:26:08,055
I shot him in the back,
sprayed him.

2204
01:26:08,210 --> 01:26:09,587
I just started shooting
from the lower back

2205
01:26:09,745 --> 01:26:11,383
all the way up to the head.
Then I crossed him,

2206
01:26:11,513 --> 01:26:13,959
from left to right.
And then he dropped.

2207
01:26:14,116 --> 01:26:16,790
Well, nobody knows nothing, because
I was shooting with a silencer.

2208
01:26:16,952 --> 01:26:19,023
But Toto, this idiot,
pulls out a .45,

2209
01:26:19,155 --> 01:26:21,465
and puts a bullet in the guy,
but with no silencer.

2210
01:26:21,624 --> 01:26:23,126
I mean, we got a police station
in the background.

2211
01:26:23,292 --> 01:26:24,771
The police station was
right behind the drug store,

2212
01:26:24,927 --> 01:26:26,406
so then we picked up
a little heat there.

2213
01:26:26,529 --> 01:26:28,600
We made it off on Kendall Drive,
going East.

2214
01:26:28,764 --> 01:26:31,404
We got out of the car, put a cover
on the car. We switch cars.

2215
01:26:32,635 --> 01:26:34,615
[man] Approximately,
5 minutes after 3,

2216
01:26:34,770 --> 01:26:38,081
the victim, identified
as a Nestor Garcia

2217
01:26:38,240 --> 01:26:40,049
went to get in a vehicle
which was parked

2218
01:26:40,176 --> 01:26:42,520
in the parking lot
of a shopping center

2219
01:26:42,678 --> 01:26:45,215
at Kendall Drive
and 117th Avenue.

2220
01:26:45,347 --> 01:26:48,419
And there was a volley
of shots fired at the car.

2221
01:26:48,551 --> 01:26:50,258
I start to think about the
way I did it, you know.

2222
01:26:50,419 --> 01:26:52,626
It was just like
run a tape in my mind.

2223
01:26:52,788 --> 01:26:53,960
A friend of mine
came over, and he said,

2224
01:26:54,123 --> 01:26:55,101
"Man, it's just business."

2225
01:26:55,257 --> 01:26:56,133
He said,
"I know how you feel,

2226
01:26:56,292 --> 01:26:57,293
I felt like that too

2227
01:26:57,459 --> 01:26:59,939
the first time I did one
but it will go away.

2228
01:27:00,096 --> 01:27:01,666
The second one,
you won't feel like that."

2229
01:27:01,831 --> 01:27:02,935
Sol looked at him,
"Are you sure?"

2230
01:27:03,099 --> 01:27:06,012
He says, "Trust me,
I've done over 50."

2231
01:27:06,168 --> 01:27:07,772
And it stuck in my mind,
it's just business.

2232
01:27:07,903 --> 01:27:11,350
From there it was
just business.

2233
01:27:13,008 --> 01:27:15,147
[man] Nestor Garcia
was killed in Kendall.

2234
01:27:15,311 --> 01:27:16,289
A couple months later
they determined

2235
01:27:16,445 --> 01:27:18,118
who his partner was.
That was Miguel.

2236
01:27:18,280 --> 01:27:20,624
[Ayala] Miguel Perez heard
that Nestor got killed.

2237
01:27:20,749 --> 01:27:23,195
He went into more hiding,
because he knew he was next.

2238
01:27:23,352 --> 01:27:25,559
And the kid, he told me that if
I was gonna find the other one,

2239
01:27:25,721 --> 01:27:27,132
I said, "You have
to give me some help here."

2240
01:27:27,289 --> 01:27:28,267
He said he didn't know
where he lived.

2241
01:27:28,390 --> 01:27:30,802
So I only know
that he owns a boutique.

2242
01:27:30,926 --> 01:27:32,837
I said, "Where?"
He said, "The Omni."

2243
01:27:32,995 --> 01:27:36,033
Miguel had a shoe shop
in the Omni shopping mall,

2244
01:27:36,198 --> 01:27:37,302
in downtown Miami.

2245
01:27:37,466 --> 01:27:39,878
[woman] The Omni International
shopping mall...

2246
01:27:40,035 --> 01:27:41,912
[man] Latins have made
the plush Omni complex

2247
01:27:42,071 --> 01:27:43,641
their unofficial headquarter.

2248
01:27:43,772 --> 01:27:45,911
[Ayala] First I went
to the Omni. Everyday.

2249
01:27:46,075 --> 01:27:48,351
I had a description
of Miguel Perez.

2250
01:27:48,510 --> 01:27:49,887
Something caught
my attention in the boutique,

2251
01:27:50,045 --> 01:27:51,046
and I walked in there.

2252
01:27:51,213 --> 01:27:53,124
There were three Cubans talking.

2253
01:27:53,249 --> 01:27:54,819
That's what caught
my attention. The Spanish.

2254
01:27:54,950 --> 01:27:56,486
I went to a pay phone
and I called the kid.

2255
01:27:56,619 --> 01:27:58,565
I said, "Describe this
Miguel one more time."

2256
01:27:58,721 --> 01:28:00,894
He described him
to the teeth, you know.

2257
01:28:01,056 --> 01:28:03,127
I said,
"I think I found him."

2258
01:28:03,259 --> 01:28:04,465
He actually
located him there.

2259
01:28:04,593 --> 01:28:05,936
Miguel Perez
came out of the boutique,

2260
01:28:06,095 --> 01:28:07,403
and went towards the elevator.

2261
01:28:07,563 --> 01:28:08,837
So there it is. Let's go.

2262
01:28:08,964 --> 01:28:10,534
We got into the elevators.
He got into the elevator.

2263
01:28:10,699 --> 01:28:11,871
I was right behind him.

2264
01:28:12,034 --> 01:28:14,378
They were going to kill him
in the Omni shopping mall itself.

2265
01:28:14,536 --> 01:28:16,914
I was gonna do him. I was gonna
stab him with an ice pick.

2266
01:28:17,072 --> 01:28:18,050
I couldn't make no noise.

2267
01:28:18,207 --> 01:28:19,550
Even the silencer makes
noise down there.

2268
01:28:19,708 --> 01:28:21,016
Somebody else got
into the elevator.

2269
01:28:21,176 --> 01:28:22,314
It was a police officer.

2270
01:28:22,444 --> 01:28:24,390
So we went a couple floors up,

2271
01:28:24,546 --> 01:28:26,321
and he walked
into a restaurant.

2272
01:28:26,449 --> 01:28:28,190
When he came out,
his bodyguards were with him,

2273
01:28:28,350 --> 01:28:29,522
so we let him go.

2274
01:28:29,651 --> 01:28:31,688
He went to the parking lot.
He got in the passenger side.

2275
01:28:31,820 --> 01:28:33,800
The bodyguard was driving.
So we followed him up.

2276
01:28:33,956 --> 01:28:36,937
He got on the I-95
and then he turns into US-1.

2277
01:28:37,093 --> 01:28:38,163
We were right behind him.

2278
01:28:38,294 --> 01:28:39,272
There were three of us.
Three cars.

2279
01:28:39,428 --> 01:28:42,705
Finally we came to US-1
and Le Jeune Road, 42nd avenue.

2280
01:28:42,832 --> 01:28:43,810
The light was green.

2281
01:28:43,966 --> 01:28:46,037
I thought we're gonna make the light,
but I said, "Just wait.

2282
01:28:46,201 --> 01:28:47,771
If he gets stuck at the light,
we'll hit him here."

2283
01:28:47,937 --> 01:28:51,510
This is the intersection
of Le Jeune Road and US-1.

2284
01:28:51,673 --> 01:28:53,414
[Ayala] The problem was,
when I crossed the street,

2285
01:28:53,575 --> 01:28:54,713
to our right was a police car.

2286
01:28:54,843 --> 01:28:56,823
And we're looking,
and we had no silencers.

2287
01:28:56,979 --> 01:28:59,289
I had a MAC-11
and the other guy had a MAC-10.

2288
01:28:59,448 --> 01:29:01,394
So we said we just got
to do it without the silencer.

2289
01:29:02,685 --> 01:29:04,062
He had the real tinted windows,

2290
01:29:04,220 --> 01:29:06,291
so we all rolled down
at the same time.

2291
01:29:06,455 --> 01:29:07,661
We fired.

2292
01:29:09,425 --> 01:29:10,904
[Singleton] They essentially
machine gunned him to death,

2293
01:29:11,026 --> 01:29:12,300
right near a rolling
intersection.

2294
01:29:12,561 --> 01:29:13,972
And he died on the scene.

2295
01:29:15,464 --> 01:29:17,375
[Ayala] As soon as we fired,
the light changed green,

2296
01:29:17,499 --> 01:29:19,843
and everybody is looking.

2297
01:29:20,002 --> 01:29:21,379
And we just, like it was
not our business,

2298
01:29:21,504 --> 01:29:25,850
we just got in gear and drove
like everybody else was driving.

2299
01:29:26,008 --> 01:29:28,113
A couple of blocks down
we dump the car...

2300
01:29:28,277 --> 01:29:30,484
We jumped in another car,
and went home.

2301
01:29:30,646 --> 01:29:32,819
A quiet residential area
in Kendall tonight

2302
01:29:32,982 --> 01:29:35,087
became the scene
of a grizzly mass murder.

2303
01:29:35,250 --> 01:29:38,663
We received a call about
5:45 at the complaint desk.

2304
01:29:38,821 --> 01:29:40,266
An anonymous call
indicating that there had been

2305
01:29:40,422 --> 01:29:41,696
a homicide at this address.

2306
01:29:41,890 --> 01:29:43,096
They call it the Kendall Six.

2307
01:29:43,259 --> 01:29:46,570
Six people were killed
in a town house.

2308
01:29:46,695 --> 01:29:49,505
[man] The bodies were found inside
a newly built three bedroom

2309
01:29:49,665 --> 01:29:51,576
town house here
at Kings Court,

2310
01:29:51,700 --> 01:29:54,579
a luxury residential community
on Kendall Drive.

2311
01:29:54,703 --> 01:29:56,239
Four men, two women,

2312
01:29:56,371 --> 01:29:57,850
The original target
was Nicolado.

2313
01:29:58,007 --> 01:30:00,487
He was the cousin of another
guy... They called him Chino.

2314
01:30:00,642 --> 01:30:03,589
They got killed at a home,
in Miami Lakes, by Rafa.

2315
01:30:03,712 --> 01:30:05,487
And he was in a war,

2316
01:30:05,648 --> 01:30:07,719
trying to bang his cousin.

2317
01:30:07,883 --> 01:30:09,362
So they put him on the list.

2318
01:30:09,518 --> 01:30:11,794
He didn't do anything to Griselda,
but since her and Rafa

2319
01:30:11,921 --> 01:30:13,901
were so close together,
business associates,

2320
01:30:14,056 --> 01:30:15,296
she made it her business.

2321
01:30:15,457 --> 01:30:16,629
[Singleton]
It was her people who did it.

2322
01:30:16,759 --> 01:30:18,602
I'm convinced
that Griselda had it done.

2323
01:30:18,727 --> 01:30:22,072
I don't know exactly
who was present.

2324
01:30:22,231 --> 01:30:23,904
It turns out that when
they went to their home,

2325
01:30:24,066 --> 01:30:26,444
one of the guys
that lived there,

2326
01:30:26,568 --> 01:30:29,378
the night before,
had a little party.

2327
01:30:29,538 --> 01:30:31,142
And there were five
other people in the house.

2328
01:30:31,307 --> 01:30:33,651
There was an additional woman
and an additional three men.

2329
01:30:33,776 --> 01:30:37,087
But once they were in there,
there was no turning back.

2330
01:30:37,346 --> 01:30:38,825
In any case like that
of the Kendall Six,

2331
01:30:38,947 --> 01:30:40,290
the quad group or whatever,

2332
01:30:40,416 --> 01:30:42,760
usually you have
one intended victim.

2333
01:30:42,918 --> 01:30:44,829
You've got four, five people
or two or three people

2334
01:30:44,953 --> 01:30:47,331
that were just at the wrong
place at the wrong time.

2335
01:30:47,489 --> 01:30:49,526
So everybody got killed.
All six people.

2336
01:30:49,692 --> 01:30:52,468
I mean, the six people,
they were tortured and killed,

2337
01:30:52,594 --> 01:30:54,870
including like a maid.

2338
01:30:55,030 --> 01:30:58,842
That murder showed what police
were worried about most.

2339
01:30:58,967 --> 01:31:01,846
And that in going
after a target,

2340
01:31:01,970 --> 01:31:03,176
the assassins are willing

2341
01:31:03,339 --> 01:31:05,216
to take out everybody
in the room.

2342
01:31:05,374 --> 01:31:07,354
That happened a lot
in Colombia.

2343
01:31:07,509 --> 01:31:09,352
Now it was happening in Miami.

2344
01:31:09,511 --> 01:31:12,082
[man 1] The Medellin newspapers
knew all about the victims,

2345
01:31:12,247 --> 01:31:15,126
days before American law
enforcers identified them.

2346
01:31:15,284 --> 01:31:17,423
[man 2] We do know that
there are six victims.

2347
01:31:17,586 --> 01:31:19,930
Four Latin males
in their 20s and 30s,

2348
01:31:20,088 --> 01:31:22,398
and two Latin females
in their 20s.

2349
01:31:22,558 --> 01:31:25,402
The police still have not released
how the victims were killed.

2350
01:31:25,561 --> 01:31:26,801
The four guys got shot,

2351
01:31:26,962 --> 01:31:28,236
and the two women
got suffocated.

2352
01:31:28,397 --> 01:31:29,501
They wrapped
them up with tape,

2353
01:31:29,632 --> 01:31:30,736
so they suffocated.

2354
01:31:30,899 --> 01:31:34,437
And there was a baby
that was left alive.

2355
01:31:34,603 --> 01:31:35,809
There was no harm
done to the baby,

2356
01:31:35,971 --> 01:31:37,450
but it was taken
from the home,

2357
01:31:38,440 --> 01:31:40,113
not to leave him there
with the dead bodies.

2358
01:31:40,275 --> 01:31:42,118
I seem to recall that

2359
01:31:42,277 --> 01:31:44,382
it was Rivi's sister
that took care of that baby.

2360
01:31:44,546 --> 01:31:46,423
[woman] Detectives have
few leads to the little boy

2361
01:31:46,582 --> 01:31:48,823
police are identifying
only as Andres.

2362
01:31:48,984 --> 01:31:52,090
At this point, the priority is
attempting to find the child.

2363
01:31:52,288 --> 01:31:53,767
[Ayala] Well,
it made big headlines.

2364
01:31:53,922 --> 01:31:55,560
[Casuso] Six people dead
and a baby missing?

2365
01:31:55,724 --> 01:31:58,398
Yeah, that was like
front page stuff.

2366
01:31:58,560 --> 01:32:01,006
We are hoping that
if in fact he was abducted,

2367
01:32:01,163 --> 01:32:03,302
as they realize that he's
only 13 months old,

2368
01:32:03,465 --> 01:32:05,536
that he can't identify them,
that he can't talk--

2369
01:32:05,667 --> 01:32:11,618
I was contacted by someone
about the problem,

2370
01:32:11,773 --> 01:32:13,775
you know, the baby.

2371
01:32:13,942 --> 01:32:15,785
I told the person
who called me,

2372
01:32:15,944 --> 01:32:17,651
"if you get arrested
with this baby,

2373
01:32:17,813 --> 01:32:20,419
you're gonna get charged
at least, at the minimum

2374
01:32:20,582 --> 01:32:24,428
with kidnapping,
if not the six homicides,

2375
01:32:24,586 --> 01:32:27,465
because the baby was like
the only clue they have."

2376
01:32:27,623 --> 01:32:30,297
[Graveline] Perhaps they'll
drop him off somewhere safe,

2377
01:32:30,459 --> 01:32:31,938
and we'll be able to at least

2378
01:32:32,060 --> 01:32:33,038
get the safe return
of the child.

2379
01:32:33,195 --> 01:32:36,665
The next day, there was
a call from Colombia

2380
01:32:36,832 --> 01:32:38,038
to the Miami police department,

2381
01:32:38,200 --> 01:32:39,144
telling them
where to find the baby.

2382
01:32:39,301 --> 01:32:42,111
They found him in a mall,
sitting on a bench.

2383
01:32:42,237 --> 01:32:45,480
You know, that's also another
crime that's never been solved.

2384
01:32:47,142 --> 01:32:48,485
[Ayala] I was getting ready
to go to New York

2385
01:32:48,644 --> 01:32:50,282
to do some work up there.

2386
01:32:50,445 --> 01:32:51,822
There was two cars
in the driveway:

2387
01:32:51,980 --> 01:32:53,186
a station wagon
and a Corvette...

2388
01:32:53,349 --> 01:32:54,623
One of my Corvettes.

2389
01:32:54,783 --> 01:32:55,784
And I was loading
my luggage

2390
01:32:55,918 --> 01:32:58,194
into the station wagon
to go to the airport.

2391
01:32:58,353 --> 01:33:00,833
And my son got into the car,
in the station wagon,

2392
01:33:00,989 --> 01:33:04,436
and opened the switch and put
the lever down. And the car,

2393
01:33:04,560 --> 01:33:06,335
the station wagon rolled over,

2394
01:33:06,495 --> 01:33:08,202
and my daughter got caught
between the two cars.

2395
01:33:08,363 --> 01:33:10,343
Broke her pelvis and ribs
and legs and stuff, you know,

2396
01:33:10,499 --> 01:33:12,001
I rushed my daughter
to the hospital,

2397
01:33:12,167 --> 01:33:14,613
and I called Griselda
I couldn't make it to New York

2398
01:33:14,737 --> 01:33:16,341
because of what happened.

2399
01:33:16,505 --> 01:33:17,609
Well, she said,
"Don't worry about it."

2400
01:33:17,739 --> 01:33:20,083
"Oh, yeah", I said, "Well, you
come to the hospital

2401
01:33:20,242 --> 01:33:21,516
and they ask for insurance
and all that shit?"

2402
01:33:21,677 --> 01:33:23,088
Back then I didn't have
all the money that I wanted.

2403
01:33:23,278 --> 01:33:24,882
So I told Griselda.
She said, "Don't worry about it.

2404
01:33:25,047 --> 01:33:26,048
You work for me.

2405
01:33:26,215 --> 01:33:28,559
When you work for me,
this is all included."

2406
01:33:28,717 --> 01:33:30,355
It's just not the money,

2407
01:33:30,519 --> 01:33:32,226
the help that she did,

2408
01:33:32,387 --> 01:33:33,365
you know, I never
forget that, you know.

2409
01:33:33,522 --> 01:33:35,866
I just liked the lady.

2410
01:33:37,092 --> 01:33:42,007
I was on my way to New York,
and I got careless.

2411
01:33:42,130 --> 01:33:45,509
We had two machine guns,
a Mac-10, a Mac-11,

2412
01:33:45,667 --> 01:33:47,112
several guns with silencers.

2413
01:33:47,269 --> 01:33:48,748
We put everything
in one suitcase.

2414
01:33:48,904 --> 01:33:49,939
I did this.

2415
01:33:50,105 --> 01:33:51,379
And we got to the airport,

2416
01:33:51,540 --> 01:33:52,746
and they drop me off fine.

2417
01:33:52,908 --> 01:33:54,353
Chucho's wife went in with us

2418
01:33:54,509 --> 01:33:55,852
and Chucho was carrying
the suitcase,

2419
01:33:55,977 --> 01:33:57,115
but it was pretty heavy.

2420
01:33:57,279 --> 01:33:58,849
You could tell it was heavy.

2421
01:33:58,981 --> 01:34:00,221
I went up to the counter
and I spoke to the girl,

2422
01:34:00,382 --> 01:34:01,554
told her that we have
a reservation

2423
01:34:01,717 --> 01:34:03,128
for a flight to La Guardia.

2424
01:34:03,285 --> 01:34:05,731
She went to pick up the suitcase.
And it was so heavy,

2425
01:34:05,888 --> 01:34:06,889
she's like, "Oh, my God,
what's in here?"

2426
01:34:07,055 --> 01:34:09,194
I said, "Just clothes
and books and stuff."

2427
01:34:09,324 --> 01:34:11,964
So she called somebody
to get it, put it on the belt.

2428
01:34:12,127 --> 01:34:13,970
When the guy did,
I looked at him

2429
01:34:14,129 --> 01:34:15,107
and I had seen him
when I walked in.

2430
01:34:15,264 --> 01:34:17,403
He was no airport worker.
And I told Chucho,

2431
01:34:17,566 --> 01:34:19,273
"We got to split up."
The guy is a cop,

2432
01:34:19,434 --> 01:34:21,675
the girl is a federal agent,
and I don't see any more.

2433
01:34:21,803 --> 01:34:22,873
So I just stood there,
you know.

2434
01:34:23,005 --> 01:34:24,279
It's impossible
they could get all of us.

2435
01:34:24,439 --> 01:34:25,679
So somebody is got to make it.

2436
01:34:25,808 --> 01:34:27,754
So I told Chucho,
"You go left,

2437
01:34:27,910 --> 01:34:30,288
I double-back, and Tulio,
you go right."

2438
01:34:30,445 --> 01:34:32,391
So I grab the ticket
and I turn around.

2439
01:34:32,547 --> 01:34:34,390
When I turn around,
like when I hit the doors,

2440
01:34:34,550 --> 01:34:36,757
she came up,
with another guy.

2441
01:34:36,919 --> 01:34:38,557
She said
she is with ATF.

2442
01:34:38,720 --> 01:34:39,630
She said, "You got
to come with me."

2443
01:34:39,788 --> 01:34:40,858
I said, "For what,
am I under arrest?"

2444
01:34:40,989 --> 01:34:42,059
She said, "Yeah, you are."

2445
01:34:42,190 --> 01:34:44,602
I was gonna run. There's
nowhere to go, you know?

2446
01:34:44,760 --> 01:34:45,864
And I didn't have
my gun with me either.

2447
01:34:45,994 --> 01:34:47,337
So I said,
"All right, let's go."

2448
01:34:47,496 --> 01:34:50,807
So they put me in this room.
I said, "What's the problem?"

2449
01:34:50,966 --> 01:34:52,138
And she says, "Your luggage."

2450
01:34:52,301 --> 01:34:54,178
There was a big table
in front of me,

2451
01:34:54,336 --> 01:34:55,781
and the suitcase is opened.

2452
01:34:55,938 --> 01:34:56,814
And they got Chucho
in there too.

2453
01:34:56,972 --> 01:34:58,883
"Is that your suitcase?" I said,
"No, ma'am, it's not mine."

2454
01:34:59,007 --> 01:35:00,315
Both the machine guns were out,

2455
01:35:00,509 --> 01:35:02,250
and the clips were outside
the machine guns,

2456
01:35:02,377 --> 01:35:03,788
but the bullets
were still in it.

2457
01:35:03,945 --> 01:35:05,253
I could've just gone for them.

2458
01:35:05,380 --> 01:35:06,450
They booked us there and then

2459
01:35:06,615 --> 01:35:07,923
they took us
to Brevard County jail.

2460
01:35:08,050 --> 01:35:10,121
Our bond was set at $150,000 each.

2461
01:35:10,285 --> 01:35:12,322
The next day
Luis Casuso showed up.

2462
01:35:12,487 --> 01:35:15,434
He had a big reputation
for representing Colombians.

2463
01:35:15,591 --> 01:35:17,468
[man] Colombian traffickers
have so much money,

2464
01:35:17,626 --> 01:35:20,368
they can easily make bond
after being arrested.

2465
01:35:20,529 --> 01:35:23,373
The testimony that you heard
is just basically

2466
01:35:23,532 --> 01:35:27,275
a scare tactic to get the judge
not to lower the bond.

2467
01:35:27,402 --> 01:35:30,212
[man] Cardona was freed on bond
lowered to $1 million.

2468
01:35:30,372 --> 01:35:32,318
She and two sisters
fled to Colombia

2469
01:35:32,474 --> 01:35:34,351
and are now back
in the cocaine business.

2470
01:35:34,509 --> 01:35:36,455
[Ayala] When he walked in,
I already knew who he was.

2471
01:35:36,611 --> 01:35:38,454
And he said that he was here
to represent both of us.

2472
01:35:38,614 --> 01:35:41,117
With the Colombians,
you get paid in cash.

2473
01:35:41,249 --> 01:35:43,354
And there was always cash,
100 dollar bills.

2474
01:35:43,518 --> 01:35:46,465
And the amount
depends on the case.

2475
01:35:46,621 --> 01:35:48,623
It's sort of like a myth
in Dade County,

2476
01:35:48,790 --> 01:35:52,067
you know, people walking in
with like sacks of currency.

2477
01:35:52,227 --> 01:35:54,229
$1 million weighs
about 20 pounds.

2478
01:35:54,396 --> 01:35:56,137
A shoe box, snicker bar...

2479
01:35:56,264 --> 01:35:58,471
Just wrap it up,
like it was a gift,

2480
01:35:58,633 --> 01:35:59,475
put it in the backseat.

2481
01:35:59,634 --> 01:36:02,137
Now you open it, count it in front
of him, you're on your way.

2482
01:36:02,270 --> 01:36:04,511
Whatever he's got to do
with that money, he does it.

2483
01:36:04,673 --> 01:36:06,152
And he used to come
into my office

2484
01:36:06,274 --> 01:36:08,618
and like put guns
on my desk.

2485
01:36:08,744 --> 01:36:10,223
He knew pretty much
what's going on.

2486
01:36:10,379 --> 01:36:12,381
I'm his lawyer,
he's telling me about stuff

2487
01:36:12,547 --> 01:36:14,151
that I really
don't want to hear

2488
01:36:14,283 --> 01:36:16,786
because, I mean,
if he's trying to impress me...

2489
01:36:18,053 --> 01:36:19,157
He's not doing that.

2490
01:36:19,287 --> 01:36:21,995
Sometimes I asked him,
"Have you seen so and so?"

2491
01:36:22,124 --> 01:36:23,899
And,
"Well, are you're looking for him?"

2492
01:36:24,059 --> 01:36:25,663
I say, "Hell, yeah,
I'm looking for him."

2493
01:36:25,827 --> 01:36:27,636
"No, I haven't seen him."

2494
01:36:27,763 --> 01:36:28,673
I don't want to hear about it,

2495
01:36:28,830 --> 01:36:30,537
you know,
I don't want to hear,

2496
01:36:30,699 --> 01:36:32,542
"Oh, we killed
this guy here, there,"

2497
01:36:32,701 --> 01:36:35,910
it was like, I used to
cut him off, you know?

2498
01:36:36,071 --> 01:36:38,108
He said, "All right, you know,
I want to put a motion

2499
01:36:38,273 --> 01:36:39,911
to have this thrown
out of court,

2500
01:36:40,075 --> 01:36:41,281
but first I got
to get you guys out."

2501
01:36:41,443 --> 01:36:42,649
We had a bonds man.

2502
01:36:42,777 --> 01:36:43,915
They had bought a house,
and they were putting

2503
01:36:44,079 --> 01:36:45,717
their house up as collateral,

2504
01:36:45,881 --> 01:36:47,918
But only for one of us.

2505
01:36:48,083 --> 01:36:50,654
I said, "Look, no. We came in
together, we leave together."

2506
01:36:50,786 --> 01:36:52,561
The bond man says,
"I was ordered to get you out."

2507
01:36:52,721 --> 01:36:54,928
So I said,
"Chucho, I'll be back for you.

2508
01:36:55,090 --> 01:36:56,262
I get you in a few days."

2509
01:36:56,424 --> 01:36:58,062
So I got out
and I told Griselda,

2510
01:36:58,226 --> 01:36:59,136
"I got to get Chucho out."

2511
01:36:59,294 --> 01:37:00,932
"But who is he?"
I said, "He's my best friend."

2512
01:37:01,096 --> 01:37:03,303
"Well, it's on you.

2513
01:37:03,465 --> 01:37:05,411
You took him,
you get him out."

2514
01:37:05,567 --> 01:37:06,773
I had that money,

2515
01:37:06,935 --> 01:37:08,209
But I had
that money laundering.

2516
01:37:08,337 --> 01:37:09,611
She wasn't paying his bond.

2517
01:37:09,771 --> 01:37:10,715
She was not getting him out,

2518
01:37:10,872 --> 01:37:13,785
because he was not part of
the crew yet. Not officially.

2519
01:37:13,942 --> 01:37:15,580
So he got pissed off.

2520
01:37:15,744 --> 01:37:17,587
So his wife...
She was staying at our house

2521
01:37:17,746 --> 01:37:19,453
most of the time with my wife.

2522
01:37:19,614 --> 01:37:21,855
And she was just talking crap,
you know,

2523
01:37:21,984 --> 01:37:23,895
making threats
that if he wasn't out,

2524
01:37:24,052 --> 01:37:25,861
she was gonna go to the FBI,

2525
01:37:25,987 --> 01:37:27,432
and she was gonna snitch
on everybody,

2526
01:37:27,589 --> 01:37:30,729
and that she had a little book
about all the killings

2527
01:37:30,892 --> 01:37:31,870
that Griselda had ordered,

2528
01:37:31,993 --> 01:37:32,903
and all the killings
that I had done.

2529
01:37:33,061 --> 01:37:34,062
Well, I said,
"You know what?

2530
01:37:34,195 --> 01:37:35,299
This is very delicate stuff,

2531
01:37:35,464 --> 01:37:37,808
you know, keep your mouth shut
and just chill out.

2532
01:37:37,966 --> 01:37:38,808
He's gonna come out.

2533
01:37:38,967 --> 01:37:40,275
If he don't come out,
we'll break him out,

2534
01:37:40,435 --> 01:37:41,345
but just chill out."

2535
01:37:41,503 --> 01:37:42,641
She said, "You tell your boss

2536
01:37:42,804 --> 01:37:44,112
if you don't get my husband
out by this week,

2537
01:37:44,373 --> 01:37:45,875
I'm gonna go to the FBI."

2538
01:37:46,007 --> 01:37:47,884
I was keeping track
of her already.

2539
01:37:48,009 --> 01:37:50,182
Anywhere she went,
somebody would follow her.

2540
01:37:50,345 --> 01:37:52,825
If she got near a police station,
she was gonna get it.

2541
01:37:52,981 --> 01:37:54,324
I went to Griselda,
and I told her.

2542
01:37:54,483 --> 01:37:56,485
She said,
"Well, you should have just

2543
01:37:56,651 --> 01:37:58,130
killed her right there then."

2544
01:37:58,286 --> 01:38:00,459
I said, "Yeah,
there was no other choice

2545
01:38:00,622 --> 01:38:02,533
but to kill
my best friend's wife."

2546
01:38:02,691 --> 01:38:08,300
I told her that Griselda wanted
to talk to her. We went to a hotel.

2547
01:38:08,463 --> 01:38:10,534
We were at the bar drinking.

2548
01:38:10,699 --> 01:38:14,511
I couldn't just bring myself...
To shoot her myself.

2549
01:38:14,669 --> 01:38:17,013
So I asked Oscar, you know,
and some other guy,

2550
01:38:17,172 --> 01:38:19,118
and they said, "No, man.

2551
01:38:19,241 --> 01:38:20,219
I ain't doing that."

2552
01:38:20,375 --> 01:38:21,376
We started to drive home.

2553
01:38:21,543 --> 01:38:24,922
Normally I usually drive,
and I threw the keys to Oscar.

2554
01:38:25,046 --> 01:38:27,117
I said, "You drive,
I'll get in the backseat."

2555
01:38:27,249 --> 01:38:29,661
Well, when she sees
this she says, "What's up?

2556
01:38:29,818 --> 01:38:30,660
You're gonna get behind me

2557
01:38:30,819 --> 01:38:31,797
so you can shoot me
behind the head?"

2558
01:38:31,953 --> 01:38:32,931
lsaid -.
, No' no: “Q

2559
01:38:33,054 --> 01:38:34,124
I just don't feel
like driving."

2560
01:38:34,256 --> 01:38:35,530
She says, "Bullshit,
I know you too well.

2561
01:38:35,690 --> 01:38:36,794
You don't let nobody drive.

2562
01:38:36,958 --> 01:38:37,800
Something's up."

2563
01:38:37,959 --> 01:38:38,801
I said, "Nothing's up."

2564
01:38:38,960 --> 01:38:40,496
She said,
"Well, if you're gonna shoot,

2565
01:38:40,662 --> 01:38:42,972
make sure you hit me right here
behind the head."

2566
01:38:43,131 --> 01:38:44,041
So I said,
"if you want, I'll drive."

2567
01:38:44,199 --> 01:38:45,644
She said, "No, don't worry
about it. I ain't worried."

2568
01:38:45,800 --> 01:38:48,679
We got about a half a block
from the house, and she was killed.

2569
01:38:50,972 --> 01:38:52,952
Her body was dumped
near our home.

2570
01:38:53,074 --> 01:38:55,145
I go home and the car
was full of blood and stuff.

2571
01:38:55,277 --> 01:38:56,551
The bullet went right
through her forehead

2572
01:38:56,711 --> 01:38:57,655
and came out the windshield.

2573
01:38:57,813 --> 01:38:58,814
So it was a mess.

2574
01:38:58,980 --> 01:38:59,822
So I put a cover on the car.

2575
01:38:59,981 --> 01:39:01,187
We always had covers
for our cars.

2576
01:39:01,349 --> 01:39:03,022
The next morning, I got up,
and I got a call from her.

2577
01:39:03,185 --> 01:39:04,061
I said, "it's done."

2578
01:39:04,286 --> 01:39:06,857
"All right."
Chucho's been calling the house.

2579
01:39:07,022 --> 01:39:08,524
But I told my wife to tell him
I wasn't at home.

2580
01:39:08,690 --> 01:39:11,671
So after 5:00, he called again,
I answer the phone.

2581
01:39:11,826 --> 01:39:13,567
He asked me
where was his wife at.

2582
01:39:13,728 --> 01:39:16,140
I said, "I don't know,
I haven't seen her."

2583
01:39:16,264 --> 01:39:18,244
He said, "You sure
you don't know where she is at?

2584
01:39:18,400 --> 01:39:19,435
I said, "No, I don't.

2585
01:39:19,601 --> 01:39:20,978
I saw her last night,
she was going out somewhere."

2586
01:39:21,102 --> 01:39:23,878
Then he says,
"I saw her on TV."

2587
01:39:24,039 --> 01:39:26,041
I said, "What?"
He said, "I saw her on TV."

2588
01:39:26,208 --> 01:39:28,085
[man] At Coral Way
and 132nd Avenue,

2589
01:39:28,243 --> 01:39:29,847
the body of
an unidentified woman

2590
01:39:30,011 --> 01:39:31,547
was found near the roadway.

2591
01:39:37,118 --> 01:39:38,222
"You killed her!"

2592
01:39:38,386 --> 01:39:40,457
I said, "I don't know
what are you talking about."

2593
01:39:40,622 --> 01:39:44,195
He says "You killed her,
you did it."

2594
01:39:44,326 --> 01:39:45,737
He said, <i>"I'll</i> get with you."

2595
01:39:45,894 --> 01:39:47,896
That's the last time
I heard of him.

2596
01:39:51,299 --> 01:39:53,404
Carlos Nossa,
we called him Manteco,

2597
01:39:53,568 --> 01:39:55,605
mantequilla, butter,
because he was real white.

2598
01:39:55,771 --> 01:39:57,375
He had green eyes,
looked American.

2599
01:39:57,506 --> 01:39:58,450
We were just like brothers.

2600
01:39:58,606 --> 01:40:01,109
Griselda didn't like him
too much.

2601
01:40:01,276 --> 01:40:02,880
She used to comment
that he was real greedy,

2602
01:40:03,045 --> 01:40:03,887
that she didn't trust him
too much.

2603
01:40:04,045 --> 01:40:05,752
That's one of the reason
they never knew where she lived.

2604
01:40:05,914 --> 01:40:06,915
I was the only one
that knew where she lived.

2605
01:40:07,081 --> 01:40:08,890
I was called that afternoon
to her house.

2606
01:40:09,051 --> 01:40:11,429
Griselda said,
"Were you at the Omni?

2607
01:40:12,421 --> 01:40:13,900
Did you run into somebody?"

2608
01:40:14,055 --> 01:40:15,966
I said,
"Yeah, I did, I run into Cacheton."

2609
01:40:16,124 --> 01:40:19,105
Cacheton was one of her customers.

2610
01:40:19,261 --> 01:40:20,604
"And what did he say?"

2611
01:40:20,762 --> 01:40:22,742
"He had a really important job
if I wanted,

2612
01:40:22,897 --> 01:40:24,638
you know,
a hit, a double hit,

2613
01:40:24,800 --> 01:40:26,336
worth a lot of money,
a lot of lot of money.

2614
01:40:26,501 --> 01:40:27,639
More than I'd ever made."

2615
01:40:27,803 --> 01:40:29,908
And she said, "Do you know
if he talked to anybody else?"

2616
01:40:30,071 --> 01:40:30,913
I said, "I believe so.

2617
01:40:31,072 --> 01:40:34,485
I caught him
talking to Manteco."

2618
01:40:34,643 --> 01:40:35,917
She said, "Well, guess what?

2619
01:40:36,077 --> 01:40:39,286
The hit that he wants you
to do is me and Dario.

2620
01:40:39,447 --> 01:40:41,154
That's what he wants."

2621
01:40:41,316 --> 01:40:43,592
Probably he was in a lot
of debt with Griselda.

2622
01:40:43,718 --> 01:40:46,130
And she said, "You got
to take care of both of them.

2623
01:40:46,287 --> 01:40:47,459
If you cannot take care,
let me know

2624
01:40:47,622 --> 01:40:49,295
and I'll send my crew to do it.

2625
01:40:49,457 --> 01:40:50,697
Manteco was my best friend.

2626
01:40:53,028 --> 01:40:54,268
Kill my best friend.

2627
01:40:56,264 --> 01:40:57,538
To this day,
I don't have no proof

2628
01:40:57,699 --> 01:40:59,679
that Manteco really
was gonna carry out the hit.

2629
01:40:59,835 --> 01:41:00,779
I doubt it very much,

2630
01:41:00,935 --> 01:41:03,506
because I'm worried
too much about friends.

2631
01:41:03,672 --> 01:41:06,152
But with her,
all she needed was a doubt.

2632
01:41:07,208 --> 01:41:08,687
It was harsh
especially with my daughter.

2633
01:41:08,844 --> 01:41:10,949
My stepdaughter, Lisa,
she was 9,

2634
01:41:11,112 --> 01:41:13,956
so she had a little more sense
than other kids.

2635
01:41:14,115 --> 01:41:15,093
She'd see guns,

2636
01:41:15,217 --> 01:41:17,390
she'd see guys coming
to the house with guns,

2637
01:41:17,552 --> 01:41:19,088
and she started
asking questions.

2638
01:41:19,220 --> 01:41:20,961
It wasn't easy.

2639
01:41:22,057 --> 01:41:23,035
A lot of the money
that I was making

2640
01:41:23,191 --> 01:41:24,534
I was giving
to my mother-in-law.

2641
01:41:24,693 --> 01:41:27,469
I set an account in Panama,
and put money away for my kids,

2642
01:41:27,596 --> 01:41:29,098
because I never thought
I was coming to prison.

2643
01:41:29,230 --> 01:41:30,709
I figured
I was gonna get killed.

2644
01:41:30,865 --> 01:41:32,936
That's what I used to go to bed
every night thinking,

2645
01:41:33,068 --> 01:41:34,308
"Maybe it's tomorrow.

2646
01:41:34,436 --> 01:41:37,212
I get into a shootout
or I put my guard down

2647
01:41:37,372 --> 01:41:38,578
and somebody's smarter than me

2648
01:41:38,740 --> 01:41:39,718
and I get shot
in back of the head,

2649
01:41:39,874 --> 01:41:40,818
sitting in a restaurant..."

2650
01:41:40,975 --> 01:41:43,012
Which almost happened,
several times.

2651
01:41:43,177 --> 01:41:44,554
That's why I used to live it
to the fullest

2652
01:41:44,713 --> 01:41:46,954
because it might be
the last day.

2653
01:41:47,081 --> 01:41:49,721
Papo Mejia, he used to be
an enforcer for Griselda.

2654
01:41:49,885 --> 01:41:52,229
Apparently he ripped her off,
and he went on his own,

2655
01:41:52,387 --> 01:41:55,732
and that's one thing that
she didn't forget or forgive.

2656
01:41:55,890 --> 01:41:56,834
She was at war now.

2657
01:41:56,992 --> 01:41:58,198
[man] There is a feud going
on right now

2658
01:41:58,360 --> 01:42:00,704
that would put the Hatfield's
and the McCoy's to shame.

2659
01:42:00,862 --> 01:42:02,205
[Ayala] She was losing
a lot of people,

2660
01:42:02,363 --> 01:42:04,240
so she asked me
if I could get some more help.

2661
01:42:04,399 --> 01:42:05,400
She said, "Make sure

2662
01:42:05,567 --> 01:42:07,012
that they know
what did they get into.

2663
01:42:07,168 --> 01:42:09,978
Don't bring me two,
like Manteco and Chucho."

2664
01:42:10,104 --> 01:42:12,015
I left that alone.

2665
01:42:12,173 --> 01:42:14,517
I said, "Yeah, I got a couple
friends up there in Chicago,

2666
01:42:14,643 --> 01:42:16,145
they're Marielitos."

2667
01:42:16,278 --> 01:42:17,985
They don't play around.

2668
01:42:18,112 --> 01:42:19,455
She said,
"That's just what I need."

2669
01:42:19,614 --> 01:42:21,389
And I mean,
they had a reputation,

2670
01:42:21,549 --> 01:42:23,460
you know,
very, very dangerous people.

2671
01:42:23,618 --> 01:42:25,894
One of them, Guillermo Foralis,
they call him Pepe.

2672
01:42:26,054 --> 01:42:27,761
I talked to him and I said,
"Why don't you fly down here?"

2673
01:42:27,923 --> 01:42:31,461
He came down, and I said,
"You got more friends?"

2674
01:42:31,626 --> 01:42:32,434
He said,
"Yeah, I got another one."

2675
01:42:32,594 --> 01:42:33,800
He sent me Miguel Perez.

2676
01:42:33,961 --> 01:42:36,339
"We were in prison
together in Cuba.

2677
01:42:36,631 --> 01:42:37,769
And we did a lot of shit in Cuba."

2678
01:42:37,932 --> 01:42:39,934
I said "Well, you think
he'd be able to kill somebody?"

2679
01:42:40,101 --> 01:42:41,944
He said,
"Yeah, he's done it before."

2680
01:42:42,103 --> 01:42:43,741
Miguelito? Yes.

2681
01:42:43,905 --> 01:42:45,543
This is a picture
that was taken of him

2682
01:42:45,673 --> 01:42:49,644
shortly after he arrived here in
1980 from the Mariel boatlift.

2683
01:42:49,811 --> 01:42:51,916
[Singleton] He just was a thug.

2684
01:42:52,080 --> 01:42:53,423
He was one of
the scariest guys

2685
01:42:53,581 --> 01:42:55,424
I've ever really encountered
in my career.

2686
01:42:55,584 --> 01:42:57,063
He was more
physically intimidating.

2687
01:42:57,218 --> 01:43:00,256
He was bigger than Rivi,
stronger physically than Rivi.

2688
01:43:00,421 --> 01:43:01,559
He's the kind of guy
that you look at,

2689
01:43:01,689 --> 01:43:02,565
you think to yourself,

2690
01:43:02,690 --> 01:43:04,397
you know, this guy
could snap at any moment,

2691
01:43:04,526 --> 01:43:06,733
and go off and probably just
snap your neck.

2692
01:43:06,861 --> 01:43:09,239
I felt it would be fun
that I had two more guys,

2693
01:43:09,397 --> 01:43:12,742
two Marielitos and a Cuban
and she said,

2694
01:43:12,867 --> 01:43:14,904
"They are your crew
and you're responsible for them."

2695
01:43:15,069 --> 01:43:16,673
[Singleton] Miguelito
essentially worked for Rivi.

2696
01:43:16,838 --> 01:43:17,942
Once he got down here,

2697
01:43:18,106 --> 01:43:20,677
he proved himself
to be reliable and ruthless

2698
01:43:20,842 --> 01:43:23,083
and they used him pretty much
in everything they went on,

2699
01:43:23,244 --> 01:43:24,587
Johnny Castor homicide...

2700
01:43:24,713 --> 01:43:26,954
[man 1] The victim is a 3-year-old,

2701
01:43:27,115 --> 01:43:30,153
appears to be a Latin male
with multiple gunshot wounds.

2702
01:43:30,318 --> 01:43:31,592
They were aiming
for his father

2703
01:43:31,719 --> 01:43:33,790
[man 2] but missed,
and they killed the child.

2704
01:43:33,955 --> 01:43:37,334
Shot, just because he happened
to be sitting next to his father,

2705
01:43:37,492 --> 01:43:38,334
who was Colombian

2706
01:43:38,493 --> 01:43:42,066
and a target of
some of the cocaine cowboys.

2707
01:43:42,197 --> 01:43:43,699
Miguelito was present for that.

2708
01:43:43,865 --> 01:43:46,436
[man] As well as the execution
style murders

2709
01:43:46,567 --> 01:43:49,138
of a man and woman
6 months later.

2710
01:43:49,304 --> 01:43:51,306
[Singleton] The Lorenzo
double homicide,

2711
01:43:51,473 --> 01:43:54,352
where the kids
were left on the scene

2712
01:43:54,509 --> 01:43:56,079
with dead parent bodies,

2713
01:43:56,211 --> 01:43:58,487
and Miguelito was definitely
present for that.

2714
01:43:58,646 --> 01:44:00,489
The fact that a baby
would be left

2715
01:44:00,648 --> 01:44:03,322
crawling on his mother's
bloody body...

2716
01:44:03,485 --> 01:44:04,725
I can't think of anything
more horrid than that,

2717
01:44:04,886 --> 01:44:06,331
I really can't.

2718
01:44:06,488 --> 01:44:08,695
[woman] Miguel Perez, he is
believed to have been involved

2719
01:44:08,856 --> 01:44:10,358
in not only those murders,

2720
01:44:10,525 --> 01:44:13,529
but another one at
a soccer field in Miami Lakes.

2721
01:44:13,695 --> 01:44:16,699
[Buchanan] These soccer-field murders
took place about a month apart.

2722
01:44:16,864 --> 01:44:18,741
The body was found
right here within 15 yards.

2723
01:44:18,900 --> 01:44:20,573
His car was parked
right in this lot.

2724
01:44:20,735 --> 01:44:23,011
Unknown Latin subject walked
up to him in point blank range,

2725
01:44:23,171 --> 01:44:24,275
shot him in the back
of the head.

2726
01:44:24,406 --> 01:44:26,044
It's turned out
to be Edgar Restrepo.

2727
01:44:26,208 --> 01:44:27,915
This was our
second soccer field homicide

2728
01:44:28,076 --> 01:44:29,214
in as many months.

2729
01:44:29,377 --> 01:44:31,186
They were commonly referred
to as Pele 1 and Pele 2.

2730
01:44:31,346 --> 01:44:33,053
I thought that was
kind of coarse,

2731
01:44:33,214 --> 01:44:35,717
but just turned out to be
another Griselda Blanco hit,

2732
01:44:35,884 --> 01:44:38,558
as was the soccer field homicide
a month prior.

2733
01:44:38,720 --> 01:44:40,222
Turns out both murders
have been committed

2734
01:44:40,388 --> 01:44:42,026
by Miguel Perez, Miguelito.

2735
01:44:42,190 --> 01:44:43,601
[Buchanan] Those out there
at the scene of one,

2736
01:44:43,758 --> 01:44:44,668
the policemen said,

2737
01:44:44,792 --> 01:44:47,238
"Soccer fields are now
an unsafe place to be."

2738
01:44:47,395 --> 01:44:49,898
But I think all of Miami
was an unsafe place to be.

2739
01:44:50,065 --> 01:44:52,238
[man] Another was shot
at the airport customs facility

2740
01:44:52,400 --> 01:44:53,777
by a man on a motorcycle.

2741
01:44:53,935 --> 01:44:57,178
Two guys came on a motor scooter
and shot him down.

2742
01:44:57,339 --> 01:44:58,750
So, you know,
welcome to Miami.

2743
01:44:58,907 --> 01:45:01,410
[man] A third was murdered leaving
at crowded department store.

2744
01:45:01,576 --> 01:45:03,419
[Singleton]
The Octavio Mejia homicide,

2745
01:45:03,578 --> 01:45:05,854
who was more commonly
known as Monomica.

2746
01:45:05,980 --> 01:45:08,187
When Mejia left the shopping mall,

2747
01:45:08,349 --> 01:45:10,625
they ambushed him.
He was shot numerous times.

2748
01:45:10,785 --> 01:45:12,526
[man]
Another suspected victim of

2749
01:45:12,721 --> 01:45:14,962
Griselda Blanco
and Paco Sepulveda.

2750
01:45:15,123 --> 01:45:17,535
[Singleton]
The Marta Gomez kidnapping--

2751
01:45:17,659 --> 01:45:19,229
--shot her point blank
in the back of her head.

2752
01:45:19,394 --> 01:45:22,102
But a little bit too low
and she survived.

2753
01:45:22,263 --> 01:45:23,742
This is just one more,
you know,

2754
01:45:23,898 --> 01:45:27,573
skirmish in the Griselda
Blanco-Mejia conflict.

2755
01:45:27,735 --> 01:45:28,907
[Ayala] The war
was picking up again,

2756
01:45:29,070 --> 01:45:30,515
and this time
it was in Colombia.

2757
01:45:30,638 --> 01:45:32,447
[man] In Colombia, a lot of blood
has been spilled in feuds

2758
01:45:32,607 --> 01:45:34,382
between the drug families.

2759
01:45:34,609 --> 01:45:36,782
A war that has left over 100 dead,

2760
01:45:36,945 --> 01:45:38,117
some of them,
innocent bystanders.

2761
01:45:38,747 --> 01:45:40,522
There was a lot of killing
going down there.

2762
01:45:40,648 --> 01:45:43,595
[man] Medellin, Colombia,
where it is common to have up to

2763
01:45:43,751 --> 01:45:45,128
12 killings a day.

2764
01:45:45,286 --> 01:45:47,732
It is home for many of
the assassins and victims,

2765
01:45:47,855 --> 01:45:49,459
who end up in Miami.

2766
01:45:49,624 --> 01:45:51,467
[Ayala] I was in Colombia
looking for Papo.

2767
01:45:51,626 --> 01:45:52,570
Rafico answered the phone,

2768
01:45:52,694 --> 01:45:53,798
talked to somebody on the phone,
then he says,

2769
01:45:53,961 --> 01:45:55,963
"We know where he's at."

2770
01:45:56,130 --> 01:45:57,473
I said, "Who?"
He says, "Papo.

2771
01:45:57,632 --> 01:45:59,111
It's about an hour from here."

2772
01:45:59,267 --> 01:46:01,474
So we got our weapons,
got our cars...

2773
01:46:01,636 --> 01:46:03,809
We drove by the Aldo Cafe.

2774
01:46:03,972 --> 01:46:05,383
It was about ten of them,
it was about ten of us.

2775
01:46:05,506 --> 01:46:06,484
We killed about three of them.

2776
01:46:06,641 --> 01:46:07,551
It went on for about an hour.

2777
01:46:07,675 --> 01:46:09,484
[man] Over the three-day
Christmas holiday,

2778
01:46:09,644 --> 01:46:11,453
there were 35 murders here.

2779
01:46:11,613 --> 01:46:14,389
In the outskirts of town,
during a January weekend,

2780
01:46:14,515 --> 01:46:17,758
the bodies of 11 murder victims
were found in garbage cans.

2781
01:46:17,885 --> 01:46:19,831
I come back to Miami
about 2 o'clock.

2782
01:46:19,987 --> 01:46:21,398
They want to see me
in Miami Lakes.

2783
01:46:21,523 --> 01:46:22,501
It's really important.

2784
01:46:22,657 --> 01:46:24,659
So I get up there,
Miami Lakes,

2785
01:46:24,826 --> 01:46:26,999
to Max Mermelstein's wife's
boutique,

2786
01:46:27,195 --> 01:46:28,003
Cristina Fashions.

2787
01:46:28,263 --> 01:46:29,970
I walk in there.
The whole group's there.

2788
01:46:30,198 --> 01:46:31,404
Griselda, Dario...

2789
01:46:31,532 --> 01:46:33,011
So I asked them
what was going on.

2790
01:46:33,167 --> 01:46:37,172
She said that Papo Mejia
was in the next flight to Miami,

2791
01:46:37,339 --> 01:46:38,841
but behind, an hour difference.

2792
01:46:39,007 --> 01:46:41,817
"We were wondering if you could
go get him at the airport."

2793
01:46:43,010 --> 01:46:45,286
I said, "No, not at the airport.

2794
01:46:45,447 --> 01:46:47,427
That's a suicide mission,
I don't do suicide missions.

2795
01:46:47,549 --> 01:46:48,619
I'll get him outside."

2796
01:46:48,750 --> 01:46:49,626
And then she said,

2797
01:46:49,750 --> 01:46:51,525
"No, I want him to get hit
inside the airport."

2798
01:46:51,686 --> 01:46:53,427
I Said, "No."

2799
01:46:53,555 --> 01:46:55,865
She also offered me
half a million dollars.

2800
01:46:56,024 --> 01:46:57,799
She reached
under one of the tables,

2801
01:46:57,925 --> 01:47:00,701
and hands me a bayonet,
16 inch bayonet.

2802
01:47:00,861 --> 01:47:02,033
I believe it was Max
who bought it

2803
01:47:02,196 --> 01:47:03,732
in one of
the U.S. army stores.

2804
01:47:04,933 --> 01:47:06,276
It was all rusted, all old.

2805
01:47:06,400 --> 01:47:07,470
She wanted him
stabbed to death,

2806
01:47:07,635 --> 01:47:09,808
just because he's a pig
and his nickname was The Pig,

2807
01:47:09,937 --> 01:47:11,541
they wanted to kill like a pig.

2808
01:47:11,706 --> 01:47:12,650
I just went along.

2809
01:47:12,774 --> 01:47:14,754
I said, "Fine, but I ain't gonna
go in there and do this."

2810
01:47:14,909 --> 01:47:15,910
So she said,

2811
01:47:16,077 --> 01:47:18,557
"Well, we got somebody else
that's gonna do it."

2812
01:47:18,713 --> 01:47:20,454
I said, "Who?"
She said, "Miguel Perez."

2813
01:47:20,581 --> 01:47:23,687
I told Miguel, I said,
"I want to go with you,

2814
01:47:23,852 --> 01:47:25,331
I want to ride with you
in the car to the airport.

2815
01:47:25,486 --> 01:47:26,760
I want to go
to the airport with you.

2816
01:47:26,921 --> 01:47:29,868
Once we show you him,
target, you're on your own."

2817
01:47:30,024 --> 01:47:31,901
[Singleton]
The stabbing of Papo Mejia,

2818
01:47:32,059 --> 01:47:34,903
Papo of course being an arch
enemy of Griselda Blanco.

2819
01:47:35,062 --> 01:47:37,542
[Ayala] Papo Mejia got a cast
from his knee to his ankle.

2820
01:47:37,698 --> 01:47:39,700
He was looking everywhere.

2821
01:47:39,867 --> 01:47:41,676
I guess he was looking for his
enemies, he was looking for us.

2822
01:47:41,803 --> 01:47:44,409
[Buchanan] And as he walks
out from customs,

2823
01:47:44,572 --> 01:47:47,712
a man came up with a bayonet
and bayoneted him several times.

2824
01:47:47,875 --> 01:47:50,913
It's insane, really,
and obviously it turned out

2825
01:47:51,079 --> 01:47:52,251
that way because
he was caught.

2826
01:47:52,413 --> 01:47:55,087
We were in the car,
was driving back with

2827
01:47:55,249 --> 01:47:56,193
Dario, and I told him.
I said,

2828
01:47:56,351 --> 01:47:57,659
"I told you this
from the beginning."

2829
01:47:57,785 --> 01:47:59,696
He said, "You think we should
worry about Miguel talking?"

2830
01:47:59,820 --> 01:48:02,528
I said, "He ain't gonna talk,
but he's in deep shit now."

2831
01:48:06,894 --> 01:48:08,237
[Singleton] I don't know
of any other organization

2832
01:48:08,396 --> 01:48:10,501
to be attributed
to the number of homicides

2833
01:48:10,631 --> 01:48:13,373
that go back to Griselda.
I just don't.

2834
01:48:16,537 --> 01:48:20,451
The caseload and the cocaine
wars was unbelievable.

2835
01:48:20,608 --> 01:48:23,088
I had never worked
so hard in my life.

2836
01:48:23,244 --> 01:48:25,155
This is what keeps us going.
Cuban coffee.

2837
01:48:25,646 --> 01:48:27,592
[man] Drug traffickers
have more manpower

2838
01:48:27,749 --> 01:48:28,625
and equipment than police.

2839
01:48:28,783 --> 01:48:30,228
[Singleton] And we were
constantly going to scenes,

2840
01:48:30,385 --> 01:48:32,763
constantly going to cases,
constantly going to trial.

2841
01:48:32,920 --> 01:48:34,524
[man] They know they're
fighting a losing battle

2842
01:48:34,656 --> 01:48:36,761
because they don't have
the personnel or equipment

2843
01:48:36,925 --> 01:48:38,905
to stay on top
of drug traffickers.

2844
01:48:39,027 --> 01:48:40,768
If they had asked me
how many people you need?

2845
01:48:40,928 --> 01:48:42,407
I couldn't even tell them
how many people I needed.

2846
01:48:42,563 --> 01:48:46,010
[man] There are just too many
homicides and so few cops.

2847
01:48:46,167 --> 01:48:47,771
And many cops
got fed up with it.

2848
01:48:47,936 --> 01:48:49,279
I've had it, I've had it.

2849
01:48:49,437 --> 01:48:51,713
I've been here 10 years,
I've buried eight cops.

2850
01:48:51,873 --> 01:48:54,410
It's all right if somebody
pulls gun on you and shoots you.

2851
01:48:54,575 --> 01:48:57,556
Everybody's all choked up for
three days till they bury you,

2852
01:48:57,678 --> 01:48:59,658
throw a bunch of dirt over you
and let's go on.

2853
01:48:59,814 --> 01:49:01,293
[man] I plan on getting out
in December.

2854
01:49:01,449 --> 01:49:03,622
I hit my 10 years
and I'm gone.

2855
01:49:03,785 --> 01:49:04,786
And when I leave
South Florida,

2856
01:49:04,952 --> 01:49:07,489
I don't care if it breaks off
and floats down to South America.

2857
01:49:07,655 --> 01:49:09,157
Because I really
don't care anymore.

2858
01:49:09,324 --> 01:49:11,861
[Singleton] He said, "Screw this,
I'm out of here," and he left.

2859
01:49:12,026 --> 01:49:13,869
[man] Twice the normal number
of policemen have quit

2860
01:49:14,028 --> 01:49:15,803
the Miami Police Department
this year.

2861
01:49:15,963 --> 01:49:18,671
[Singleton] And there was
a rush to hire cops

2862
01:49:18,833 --> 01:49:19,937
to fill these vacancies.

2863
01:49:20,067 --> 01:49:22,047
[woman] Both Metro
and Miami police departments

2864
01:49:22,203 --> 01:49:24,877
are making a major push
to fill the vacancies

2865
01:49:25,039 --> 01:49:27,349
left in the wake
of record resignation rates.

2866
01:49:27,508 --> 01:49:29,954
Metro has even hired
an outside firm

2867
01:49:30,077 --> 01:49:32,023
to help boost
minority recruiting.

2868
01:49:32,179 --> 01:49:34,455
It used to be we just took
the top of the barrel,

2869
01:49:34,615 --> 01:49:36,458
now we're taking the entire
barrel as far as applicants.

2870
01:49:36,617 --> 01:49:39,063
A lot of people got hired
to be police officers

2871
01:49:39,220 --> 01:49:40,699
that, under ordinary circumstances,

2872
01:49:40,855 --> 01:49:41,993
would not have been hired.

2873
01:49:43,992 --> 01:49:48,634
Back in July of 1985,
a triple homicide investigation

2874
01:49:48,796 --> 01:49:50,833
began when three bodies
were taken

2875
01:49:50,998 --> 01:49:53,706
outside of the Jones Boat Yard,
on the Miami River.

2876
01:49:53,868 --> 01:49:55,677
[woman] Three bodies floating
in the Miami River,

2877
01:49:55,837 --> 01:49:58,477
in what appeared to be
an almost routine homicide.

2878
01:49:58,639 --> 01:50:00,050
Two nights prior,

2879
01:50:00,208 --> 01:50:02,711
there was a boat right here
being offloaded,

2880
01:50:02,877 --> 01:50:04,481
200 kilograms of cocaine.

2881
01:50:04,645 --> 01:50:09,355
Six uniformed individuals
raided this boat,

2882
01:50:09,517 --> 01:50:11,519
and there were six off loaders
on the boat.

2883
01:50:11,686 --> 01:50:13,859
They all six jumped into the Miami
River, where this Marina is.

2884
01:50:14,021 --> 01:50:17,491
Three of them survived,
three of them didn't.

2885
01:50:18,860 --> 01:50:19,668
Three of them drowned,

2886
01:50:19,827 --> 01:50:21,898
and they surfaced
like 2 days later.

2887
01:50:22,062 --> 01:50:23,234
It didn't take long
to determine

2888
01:50:23,397 --> 01:50:24,341
they were involved
in trafficking,

2889
01:50:24,499 --> 01:50:28,106
them being Latin, being traffickers
that became a CENTAC case within a week.

2890
01:50:28,269 --> 01:50:29,339
Back in 1985,

2891
01:50:29,504 --> 01:50:32,417
a very common crime
was robberies

2892
01:50:32,573 --> 01:50:34,678
and rip-offs
by police impersonators.

2893
01:50:34,842 --> 01:50:36,753
We assumed
that was the case here.

2894
01:50:36,911 --> 01:50:38,288
That just some people
bought some uniforms...

2895
01:50:38,446 --> 01:50:39,424
They're drug rip.

2896
01:50:39,580 --> 01:50:41,856
We got a telephone call
from detective Louis Alberti

2897
01:50:41,983 --> 01:50:44,486
that said he had a uniformed
officer on his department

2898
01:50:44,619 --> 01:50:46,064
that had information
regarding this case.

2899
01:50:46,220 --> 01:50:48,063
So about 11 o'clock one evening,
we went over there

2900
01:50:48,222 --> 01:50:49,724
to speak with this officer,
Armando Estrada.

2901
01:50:49,924 --> 01:50:51,528
It became very obvious,

2902
01:50:51,692 --> 01:50:53,262
very quickly,
that the information

2903
01:50:53,427 --> 01:50:57,500
this officer was giving us
was so obviously erroneous,

2904
01:50:57,632 --> 01:50:59,441
that it was transparent that
he was trying to throw us off.

2905
01:50:59,600 --> 01:51:01,739
It was at that point
we both knew instinctively

2906
01:51:01,902 --> 01:51:04,143
that we had a case
of police corruption

2907
01:51:04,305 --> 01:51:06,785
as opposed
to police impersonators.

2908
01:51:06,941 --> 01:51:08,887
[woman] Allegations of
unprecedented corruption

2909
01:51:09,009 --> 01:51:10,579
within the Miami
police department.

2910
01:51:10,744 --> 01:51:13,884
We experienced the largest
police corruption crisis

2911
01:51:14,015 --> 01:51:17,462
since the Serpico days
up in New York.

2912
01:51:17,618 --> 01:51:18,619
[Singleton] We hated it.

2913
01:51:18,786 --> 01:51:20,697
The last thing you want to do is
have to investigate other cops.

2914
01:51:20,822 --> 01:51:22,768
But it's got to be done,
it's got to be done.

2915
01:51:22,924 --> 01:51:25,165
[woman] Seven police officers
were arrested.

2916
01:51:25,326 --> 01:51:27,897
Some accused of causing
the drownings on the river,

2917
01:51:28,029 --> 01:51:30,066
ripping off drug dealers,
plotting to kill

2918
01:51:30,198 --> 01:51:33,179
or intimidate witnesses
to their alleged crimes.

2919
01:51:33,334 --> 01:51:36,076
A few months later the scandal
broke wide open.

2920
01:51:36,204 --> 01:51:38,912
Rudy Arias turned
from defendant to informer,

2921
01:51:39,040 --> 01:51:40,075
confessing his crimes

2922
01:51:40,207 --> 01:51:42,153
and naming upwards
of 60 other cops

2923
01:51:42,309 --> 01:51:44,585
he claimed were also crooked.

2924
01:51:44,745 --> 01:51:46,554
[man] Two new indictments
are expected this month

2925
01:51:46,680 --> 01:51:47,818
in the River Cop's case.

2926
01:51:47,982 --> 01:51:49,791
And more indictments
are expected after that.

2927
01:51:49,951 --> 01:51:51,794
The River cops
are trying to break down

2928
01:51:52,120 --> 01:51:53,258
the door to make deals.

2929
01:51:53,388 --> 01:51:55,299
Rodolfo Arias
has reportedly proved

2930
01:51:55,456 --> 01:51:56,833
to be an excellent witness.

2931
01:51:56,991 --> 01:51:59,471
He has given information
on dozens of other cops.

2932
01:51:59,627 --> 01:52:01,504
[woman] Eighteen former
policemen charged,

2933
01:52:01,662 --> 01:52:03,608
four becoming
government witnesses,

2934
01:52:03,764 --> 01:52:05,300
two going into hiding,

2935
01:52:05,466 --> 01:52:08,845
eight pleading guilty either
before or during their trials,

2936
01:52:09,003 --> 01:52:11,813
one convicted,
and another still facing trial.

2937
01:52:11,973 --> 01:52:14,476
In the meantime,
20 more former police officers

2938
01:52:14,642 --> 01:52:16,349
are under investigation
by Miami,

2939
01:52:16,510 --> 01:52:19,616
Metro Dade or FBI agents,
facing possible charges

2940
01:52:19,781 --> 01:52:21,852
in either state
or federal court.

2941
01:52:22,016 --> 01:52:24,360
The charges were
unbelievable, shocking.

2942
01:52:24,519 --> 01:52:27,989
The most shocking case
I had ever even heard of.

2943
01:52:28,155 --> 01:52:30,931
Murders,
creative disposals of bodies,

2944
01:52:31,058 --> 01:52:34,596
witness intimidation,
laundering huge sums of money,

2945
01:52:34,729 --> 01:52:36,640
extortion, drug dealing,

2946
01:52:36,797 --> 01:52:39,209
hundreds of
kilograms of cocaine...

2947
01:52:39,367 --> 01:52:41,005
And they were
all police officers,

2948
01:52:41,169 --> 01:52:43,240
who were accused
of doing this.

2949
01:52:43,404 --> 01:52:45,714
There was no law and order
whatsoever.

2950
01:52:46,641 --> 01:52:49,383
We have to start taking the war
on drugs very seriously.

2951
01:52:49,543 --> 01:52:51,352
If we don't, we're gonna have
something like domestic Vietnam,

2952
01:52:51,512 --> 01:52:52,855
where we're either gonna
fight the war and win it,

2953
01:52:53,014 --> 01:52:54,084
or we're just
gonna give up.

2954
01:52:54,248 --> 01:52:55,955
They're gonna wait
until some senator's daughter

2955
01:52:56,083 --> 01:52:58,893
or some congressmen's nephew
gets kidnapped.

2956
01:52:59,053 --> 01:53:00,498
Because they think
that he had something to do

2957
01:53:00,654 --> 01:53:03,635
with passing some law
that is not beneficial to them,

2958
01:53:03,758 --> 01:53:05,396
and then
what are we gonna do?

2959
01:53:05,560 --> 01:53:08,404
[Paula Hawkins] We need to have
a great backlash at home,

2960
01:53:08,563 --> 01:53:10,565
that the governments that are
involved in drug trafficking,

2961
01:53:10,731 --> 01:53:12,404
they should be sanctioned.

2962
01:53:12,566 --> 01:53:16,343
And we should all make
a great effort to isolate them

2963
01:53:16,470 --> 01:53:17,881
from the civilized world.

2964
01:53:18,038 --> 01:53:19,813
[Ayala] Paula Hawkins...
She was making a lot of waves

2965
01:53:19,941 --> 01:53:22,581
during the cocaine wars,
when Reagan was down here with Bush.

2966
01:53:22,743 --> 01:53:26,020
Max started this,
showing the paper to Griselda,

2967
01:53:26,146 --> 01:53:28,057
about Paula Hawkins
making the speeches

2968
01:53:28,315 --> 01:53:30,693
about the drug trade
and this and that.

2969
01:53:30,851 --> 01:53:33,695
We were at Max's house
and Griselda's says,

2970
01:53:33,854 --> 01:53:35,731
"I want to kill this bitch."

2971
01:53:35,890 --> 01:53:36,925
I said, "Who would that be?"

2972
01:53:37,091 --> 01:53:38,934
She said, "This bitch, Paula."

2973
01:53:39,093 --> 01:53:40,868
I said, "Paula Hawkins?
She's a senator."

2974
01:53:41,028 --> 01:53:42,132
She said,
"Yeah, I want you to kill her."

2975
01:53:42,296 --> 01:53:44,207
I said, "Me?
No, I won't do that."

2976
01:53:44,332 --> 01:53:46,710
She says, "I'll pay you good."
I said, "I don't care."

2977
01:53:46,867 --> 01:53:48,278
That's too much heat.

2978
01:53:48,435 --> 01:53:50,540
She gets killed...
There ain't no place for us

2979
01:53:50,705 --> 01:53:51,843
to hide once you
kill the senator.

2980
01:53:51,973 --> 01:53:53,714
She asked me if it could be done.
I said, "it could be done.

2981
01:53:53,874 --> 01:53:55,854
She's another person.
It could be done."

2982
01:53:55,977 --> 01:53:57,547
She was gonna have
a speech in New Orleans.

2983
01:53:57,711 --> 01:53:59,554
It was about 3 weeks away
for this speech.

2984
01:53:59,714 --> 01:54:02,718
In Colombia,
it's a normal thing everyday,

2985
01:54:02,883 --> 01:54:04,328
but in the United States
we had never discussed

2986
01:54:04,485 --> 01:54:07,955
the killing of a president
or senator... No. Or a judge.

2987
01:54:08,122 --> 01:54:10,500
Just lawyers.
We talk about that every day.

2988
01:54:10,758 --> 01:54:11,793
Well, Max kept pushing.

2989
01:54:11,959 --> 01:54:13,097
"Yeah, you know,
Rivi should do it.

2990
01:54:13,260 --> 01:54:14,864
Rivi is the guy,
he's a good marksman,

2991
01:54:14,995 --> 01:54:15,769
this and that..."

2992
01:54:15,930 --> 01:54:18,240
I started telling Griselda...
I said, "if this is done,

2993
01:54:18,499 --> 01:54:20,979
your business goes down
the drain.

2994
01:54:21,135 --> 01:54:22,876
There's no place for you
to hide, nowhere in the world.

2995
01:54:23,003 --> 01:54:24,414
They're gonna chase you
for the rest of your life.

2996
01:54:24,539 --> 01:54:26,883
They're chasing you now,
but this is nothing compared

2997
01:54:27,008 --> 01:54:28,351
to what you'd get into.

2998
01:54:28,509 --> 01:54:30,887
Well, I talked to Griselda,
I talked to Dario.

2999
01:54:31,011 --> 01:54:32,752
I got some sense into them,
I said, "Leave this alone,

3000
01:54:32,913 --> 01:54:34,358
it's not good for business."

3001
01:54:34,515 --> 01:54:36,119
I think this is
one of the gravest problems

3002
01:54:36,283 --> 01:54:38,786
facing us internally
in the United States.

3003
01:54:38,953 --> 01:54:40,899
[man] You're gonna have
to quit treating this

3004
01:54:41,021 --> 01:54:43,262
national problem that we have
here in this area,

3005
01:54:43,390 --> 01:54:46,166
as a local problem,
and put the resources

3006
01:54:46,327 --> 01:54:49,308
and money and people and agents
in here to cope with it.

3007
01:54:49,463 --> 01:54:50,771
They were getting fed up
with especially

3008
01:54:50,931 --> 01:54:52,342
Vice President Bush in Miami,
and all that.

3009
01:54:52,700 --> 01:54:55,078
[Bush] For those that come in here
with their automatic weapons

3010
01:54:55,202 --> 01:54:58,740
and their Learjets and their
boats all for petty cash,

3011
01:54:58,872 --> 01:55:01,682
kind of cost of doing business
because the profits are so big,

3012
01:55:01,842 --> 01:55:05,949
put them away, find them,
catch them, arrest them.

3013
01:55:06,113 --> 01:55:09,094
The town had enough, the
federal government had enough.

3014
01:55:09,216 --> 01:55:11,196
They brought in
the task forces,

3015
01:55:11,352 --> 01:55:13,195
they brought in
the cavalry.

3016
01:55:13,353 --> 01:55:14,388
They were bringing in
the state troopers

3017
01:55:14,555 --> 01:55:16,000
to patrol the streets in Miami.

3018
01:55:16,157 --> 01:55:18,398
[man] I would hope and pray
that these people

3019
01:55:18,559 --> 01:55:20,334
will get the maximum
death penalty,

3020
01:55:20,494 --> 01:55:22,531
to make an example
to the rest of the drug culture

3021
01:55:22,696 --> 01:55:25,768
that's happening around Florida,
that we won't tolerate.

3022
01:55:25,900 --> 01:55:27,106
There should be
no mercy on them.

3023
01:55:27,234 --> 01:55:29,942
[man 1] The Navy loaned
two of its radar planes.

3024
01:55:30,070 --> 01:55:32,641
The Army has loaned
helicopter gunships.

3025
01:55:32,807 --> 01:55:35,117
[man 2] The war is being
waged in the Atlantic.

3026
01:55:35,242 --> 01:55:36,983
Ships and planes,
part of Hat Trick,

3027
01:55:37,144 --> 01:55:38,782
to stop drug trafficking.

3028
01:55:38,912 --> 01:55:43,884
Operation Hat Trick is the
D-Day of our war on drugs.

3029
01:55:44,051 --> 01:55:47,589
[man 1] Military ships and aircraft
with narcotics agents aboard

3030
01:55:47,755 --> 01:55:49,234
tracked suspected smugglers.

3031
01:55:49,390 --> 01:55:51,996
[man 2] It's expected to please
law enforcement officials.

3032
01:55:52,159 --> 01:55:54,332
They've been trying for
a long time to get more help

3033
01:55:54,461 --> 01:55:55,735
from the military
in the war on drugs.

3034
01:55:55,896 --> 01:55:58,376
[man 3] Any smuggler
who's going to enter the coast

3035
01:55:58,533 --> 01:56:01,241
of the United States now,
is now gonna be

3036
01:56:01,402 --> 01:56:04,679
somewhat apprehensive that
he may not make a go of it.

3037
01:56:04,839 --> 01:56:10,221
[Reagan] Arrests in the area covered
by the task force are up 27%.

3038
01:56:10,377 --> 01:56:12,584
Drug seizures
are up about 50%.

3039
01:56:12,746 --> 01:56:15,852
So there was just too much police,
and a lot of heat on TV.

3040
01:56:16,017 --> 01:56:17,928
Since she had business
in California too,

3041
01:56:18,085 --> 01:56:19,826
I told Griselda, we should
just leave for a while.

3042
01:56:19,953 --> 01:56:21,728
She said, "Yeah, that's
a good idea, plus you know,

3043
01:56:21,889 --> 01:56:24,165
we're opening up
a new route to California."

3044
01:56:24,291 --> 01:56:26,862
Now that we know,
you know, in hindsight

3045
01:56:27,027 --> 01:56:29,871
that she left the area
back in around 1984,

3046
01:56:30,030 --> 01:56:32,772
clearly the homicide rate
went down in that time period.

3047
01:56:32,933 --> 01:56:34,913
The efforts here
by the drug task force

3048
01:56:35,069 --> 01:56:37,174
has officials in other
parts of the country

3049
01:56:37,304 --> 01:56:40,046
say now they've got increased
problems with drug smugglers,

3050
01:56:40,207 --> 01:56:41,948
moving cocaine
through other places,

3051
01:56:42,109 --> 01:56:43,782
places away from Miami.

3052
01:56:43,944 --> 01:56:46,652
[woman] The Colombian network
is spreading to Los Angeles,

3053
01:56:46,814 --> 01:56:48,487
where police say
cocaine seizures

3054
01:56:48,649 --> 01:56:50,060
are bigger than ever.

3055
01:56:50,217 --> 01:56:52,060
Faced with the fact that
the whole organization

3056
01:56:52,219 --> 01:56:56,258
had relocated to California,
and I'm a Miami agent,

3057
01:56:56,423 --> 01:57:00,337
I had to convince my superiors
that it was worthwhile for me

3058
01:57:00,494 --> 01:57:02,201
to investigate a case
in California.

3059
01:57:02,329 --> 01:57:03,808
You know,
I said if I ever get her,

3060
01:57:03,964 --> 01:57:05,910
I'm gonna give her
a kiss on the cheek.

3061
01:57:08,602 --> 01:57:11,640
[Roberts] What Mickey brought
was only part of it.

3062
01:57:11,805 --> 01:57:13,978
And I never would let Mickey
know if I had anybody else

3063
01:57:14,141 --> 01:57:16,451
working, because I did
try other people also.

3064
01:57:16,610 --> 01:57:19,420
We were working with Barry Seal.
He was another group.

3065
01:57:19,547 --> 01:57:21,959
[man] Barry had been a TWA pilot,

3066
01:57:22,116 --> 01:57:23,993
and a Vietnam War pilot
before that.

3067
01:57:24,151 --> 01:57:26,131
[Roberts] Barry was,
out of everybody,

3068
01:57:26,286 --> 01:57:28,459
the best pilot
that I ever saw in my life.

3069
01:57:28,622 --> 01:57:32,434
[man] And he drifted into
the Colombian cartel market

3070
01:57:32,559 --> 01:57:34,334
as a delivering specialist.

3071
01:57:34,495 --> 01:57:37,237
And got himself
involved in guns,

3072
01:57:37,364 --> 01:57:40,243
money and drugs,
through flights

3073
01:57:40,367 --> 01:57:41,971
in and out of
Managua, Nicaragua,

3074
01:57:42,136 --> 01:57:46,107
where he enjoyed the protection
of the president of Nicaragua.

3075
01:57:46,273 --> 01:57:49,618
Barry Seal had the most
incredible operation I'd ever seen.

3076
01:57:49,743 --> 01:57:50,721
I'm not a drug smuggler.

3077
01:57:50,878 --> 01:57:52,186
I say, "Prove it."

3078
01:57:52,346 --> 01:57:53,620
[Roberts] Barry was fearless.

3079
01:57:53,747 --> 01:57:56,489
1,000, 1,500 kilos of coke
was like a joke to him,

3080
01:57:56,650 --> 01:57:57,958
and it was not a problem.

3081
01:57:58,119 --> 01:57:59,689
Barry worked
out of Louisiana.

3082
01:57:59,853 --> 01:58:01,127
He'd work
on the drop of a hat.

3083
01:58:01,288 --> 01:58:02,494
He didn't care.
He'd get in his plane,

3084
01:58:02,656 --> 01:58:04,863
and he'd go down there. And he'd
throw 1,000 kilos on the plane,

3085
01:58:05,025 --> 01:58:06,265
and he'd come back to Louisiana.

3086
01:58:06,393 --> 01:58:08,930
He landed at a regular airport.
He had a warehouse.

3087
01:58:09,063 --> 01:58:11,009
They had ramps in the back
that would open up,

3088
01:58:11,165 --> 01:58:12,667
and you could drive
vehicles into them.

3089
01:58:12,833 --> 01:58:14,710
You could put tons
on these vehicles.

3090
01:58:14,868 --> 01:58:17,974
Barry got busted on a load,
and didn't tell anybody.

3091
01:58:18,139 --> 01:58:19,743
He cut himself a deal,

3092
01:58:19,907 --> 01:58:22,114
as a federal
confidential informant.

3093
01:58:22,242 --> 01:58:25,382
They would let him go
and they would install cameras

3094
01:58:25,545 --> 01:58:28,219
on the inside of his plane.
And they wanted him to film

3095
01:58:28,382 --> 01:58:31,022
an actual loading,
bring the coke back here,

3096
01:58:31,185 --> 01:58:32,664
and the film back here.

3097
01:58:32,786 --> 01:58:34,663
And he agreed to do this.

3098
01:58:34,789 --> 01:58:37,497
The Army brought
in the truckloads,

3099
01:58:37,624 --> 01:58:38,864
the duffel bags full of cocaine.

3100
01:58:39,026 --> 01:58:40,403
And they were loaded
on board the aircraft

3101
01:58:40,561 --> 01:58:42,598
by the Cuban
and Sandinista soldiers.

3102
01:58:42,763 --> 01:58:44,140
And he had some great shots.

3103
01:58:44,264 --> 01:58:46,608
[man] Barry Seal was able to snap
pictures during the mission

3104
01:58:46,767 --> 01:58:48,747
of a leading international
cocaine trafficker,

3105
01:58:48,903 --> 01:58:50,905
Sandinista government
officials and soldiers,

3106
01:58:51,072 --> 01:58:53,074
loading cocaine onto the plane.

3107
01:58:53,240 --> 01:58:55,151
Top Nicaraguan
government officials

3108
01:58:55,276 --> 01:58:57,552
are deeply involved
in drug trafficking.

3109
01:58:57,711 --> 01:58:59,418
And on national TV,
President Reagan

3110
01:58:59,580 --> 01:59:02,254
held up this picture,
and said, "Here's Pablo Escobar,

3111
01:59:02,416 --> 01:59:03,918
loading a plane with cocaine."

3112
01:59:04,084 --> 01:59:06,690
[Reagan] This picture secretly
taken at a military airfield

3113
01:59:06,821 --> 01:59:10,325
outside Managua,
shows Frederico Vaughan,

3114
01:59:10,457 --> 01:59:12,698
a top aide to one
of the nine commandantes,

3115
01:59:12,827 --> 01:59:15,034
who rule Nicaragua,
loading an aircraft

3116
01:59:15,195 --> 01:59:18,574
with illegal narcotics
bound for the United States.

3117
01:59:18,732 --> 01:59:20,268
The pictures were
produced by Barry Seal.

3118
01:59:20,434 --> 01:59:23,813
[man 1] He has thus become the key
witness in South Florida's

3119
01:59:23,971 --> 01:59:25,473
most important drug case.

3120
01:59:25,639 --> 01:59:28,415
[man 2] Seal also told a President's
commission on organized crime

3121
01:59:28,576 --> 01:59:30,556
how easy it is
to smuggle cocaine.

3122
01:59:30,678 --> 01:59:32,658
My initial experience
was with marijuana,

3123
01:59:32,813 --> 01:59:36,955
but I soon moved into cocaine
because of its ease in handling,

3124
01:59:37,117 --> 01:59:38,289
and its profit structure.

3125
01:59:38,452 --> 01:59:42,594
That's when the heat started
to come to Escobar and to Ochoa.

3126
01:59:42,757 --> 01:59:43,735
Not from the Colombians.

3127
01:59:43,857 --> 01:59:46,098
The Colombians
didn't give a god damn.

3128
01:59:46,259 --> 01:59:48,796
But this government who was
giving Colombian money,

3129
01:59:48,962 --> 01:59:50,908
started to put heat on them
down there.

3130
01:59:51,064 --> 01:59:54,204
[man] Seal is already cooperating
with drug agents in Miami,

3131
01:59:54,401 --> 01:59:56,381
where he is a key witness
in one of the most

3132
01:59:56,503 --> 01:59:59,245
significant investigations
in South Florida history.

3133
01:59:59,406 --> 02:00:01,613
Meantime, there are still
unanswered questions

3134
02:00:01,775 --> 02:00:03,311
in the Baton Rouge
investigation.

3135
02:00:03,477 --> 02:00:06,754
[Burstyn] There was a judge
out in Baton Rouge, Louisiana,

3136
02:00:06,880 --> 02:00:09,827
who just kind of
didn't like the fact

3137
02:00:09,984 --> 02:00:13,830
that a federal judge in Miami
was going to be the final

3138
02:00:13,987 --> 02:00:16,490
arbiter of Mr. Seal's fate.

3139
02:00:16,657 --> 02:00:18,398
A federal grand jury
in Baton Rouge

3140
02:00:18,525 --> 02:00:21,506
has been investigating Seal's
activities for 15 months.

3141
02:00:21,661 --> 02:00:24,267
Today's indictment charged
Seal with conspiracy

3142
02:00:24,431 --> 02:00:27,878
to possess and distribute
462 pounds of cocaine,

3143
02:00:28,101 --> 02:00:31,412
with a street value
estimated at $168 million.

3144
02:00:31,538 --> 02:00:33,540
In return for Seal's cooperation,

3145
02:00:33,707 --> 02:00:36,347
the Justice Department
will allow him to plead guilty

3146
02:00:36,510 --> 02:00:39,252
to the charges in today's indictment,
and receive

3147
02:00:39,379 --> 02:00:41,017
what amounts to a slap
on the wrist.

3148
02:00:41,181 --> 02:00:43,525
I've reached exactly
the type of settlement

3149
02:00:43,684 --> 02:00:44,526
that I wanted to reach.

3150
02:00:44,685 --> 02:00:46,323
Whether they're happy or not,
you'll have to ask them.

3151
02:00:46,486 --> 02:00:50,457
And despite numerous pleas,
thatjudge in Louisiana

3152
02:00:50,591 --> 02:00:55,506
refused to drop a 6-month
house arrest order,

3153
02:00:55,662 --> 02:00:57,903
which was a totally
meaningless order

3154
02:00:58,065 --> 02:00:59,009
in the scheme of things.

3155
02:00:59,166 --> 02:01:02,147
It was speculated that
this judge knew,

3156
02:01:02,302 --> 02:01:05,545
or should have known,
that, by publicly ordering

3157
02:01:05,705 --> 02:01:07,446
where this man had to show up

3158
02:01:07,574 --> 02:01:09,315
and at what time he had
to show up and leave,

3159
02:01:09,476 --> 02:01:11,387
he was issuing
a death warrant for him.

3160
02:01:11,545 --> 02:01:13,718
And certainly,
that's what happened.

3161
02:01:13,880 --> 02:01:16,156
The exciting thing
in life to me

3162
02:01:16,316 --> 02:01:18,318
is to get into
a life-threatening situation.

3163
02:01:18,485 --> 02:01:19,520
Now that's excitement.

3164
02:01:19,687 --> 02:01:23,533
The Colombians told Max,
"This guy is a rat,

3165
02:01:23,690 --> 02:01:25,397
and we got to take him out,

3166
02:01:25,559 --> 02:01:27,561
because he is talking
and telling everything on us."

3167
02:01:27,728 --> 02:01:29,901
Max came to me
and Max said, "Look,

3168
02:01:30,063 --> 02:01:33,010
the Colombians
want to pay $250,000

3169
02:01:33,166 --> 02:01:34,474
to whack this guy
and kill him.

3170
02:01:34,601 --> 02:01:37,548
I know your friends from New York .
Get the guineas..."

3171
02:01:37,704 --> 02:01:38,944
They call them spaghetti boys...

3172
02:01:39,106 --> 02:01:41,882
"Get the spaghetti guys to come
and whack Barry Seal."

3173
02:01:42,042 --> 02:01:44,181
I flew to New York,
spoke to my uncle.

3174
02:01:44,344 --> 02:01:46,085
My uncle said, "Okay, I'll get
you two guys tomorrow.

3175
02:01:46,246 --> 02:01:47,725
Take them down
and show them where to go."

3176
02:01:47,881 --> 02:01:49,554
I called Max, I told Max,
"Don't worry.

3177
02:01:49,716 --> 02:01:50,592
Everything is done, Max."

3178
02:01:50,751 --> 02:01:53,095
We spent about 2 days
there in Louisiana.

3179
02:01:53,253 --> 02:01:55,597
We showed them
where Barry Seal lived,

3180
02:01:55,756 --> 02:01:57,861
the hangars where he
worked at the airport...

3181
02:01:57,991 --> 02:01:59,368
We showed these guys everything.

3182
02:01:59,526 --> 02:02:01,437
The whole time I was there,

3183
02:02:01,595 --> 02:02:03,597
not one time
did I see Barry Seal.

3184
02:02:03,763 --> 02:02:06,369
About a week later,
my friends told me,

3185
02:02:06,533 --> 02:02:09,343
"Sorry, whoever whacks this guy,
he's going to get caught.

3186
02:02:09,469 --> 02:02:11,972
He's walking with an entourage
of government people.

3187
02:02:12,139 --> 02:02:13,243
There's no way

3188
02:02:13,407 --> 02:02:16,115
you're gonna be able to whack
this guy and not get caught."

3189
02:02:16,276 --> 02:02:20,383
Max went and told Rafa,
and Rafa flew off the handle.

3190
02:02:20,547 --> 02:02:21,457
"That's it for you guys.

3191
02:02:21,615 --> 02:02:22,821
You guys ain't going
to work any more

3192
02:02:22,983 --> 02:02:24,894
because you can't knock
this guy off," you know?

3193
02:02:25,019 --> 02:02:26,521
"I can't.

3194
02:02:26,653 --> 02:02:27,961
I had nobody else,
what do you want me to do,

3195
02:02:28,121 --> 02:02:29,623
go get some guys on the street
to knock him off?

3196
02:02:29,789 --> 02:02:30,824
There's nothing I can do."

3197
02:02:30,991 --> 02:02:33,130
Max fell out of favor
with the Colombians

3198
02:02:33,293 --> 02:02:34,533
because he couldn't
whack the guy.

3199
02:02:34,661 --> 02:02:36,265
Max tried to blame it on me.

3200
02:02:36,430 --> 02:02:39,104
For a while, the Colombians
were really mad with me.

3201
02:02:39,266 --> 02:02:41,542
I mean, mad to the point
where we didn't even work.

3202
02:02:41,669 --> 02:02:43,376
I was really afraid
at that point,

3203
02:02:43,503 --> 02:02:44,914
that I was gonna
get whacked myself,

3204
02:02:45,038 --> 02:02:46,642
because I couldn't do
what they asked.

3205
02:02:46,807 --> 02:02:48,252
Rafa came to my house,

3206
02:02:48,408 --> 02:02:50,547
and he came with
Fabito Ochoa.

3207
02:02:50,678 --> 02:02:52,021
Fabito was my friend.

3208
02:02:52,179 --> 02:02:53,783
I hung out with him,
we ran together.

3209
02:02:53,947 --> 02:02:56,985
And Fabito said, "Man,
my family is really mad."

3210
02:02:57,150 --> 02:02:58,288
I Said, "Why?"

3211
02:02:58,451 --> 02:03:00,158
He said, "Can't you
whack this guy for us?

3212
02:03:00,320 --> 02:03:02,027
You don't understand
the problems he's gonna make."

3213
02:03:02,189 --> 02:03:03,395
And I said, "Fabito,

3214
02:03:03,523 --> 02:03:05,161
whoever does
it is gonna get caught.

3215
02:03:05,325 --> 02:03:06,770
There's no way that
it's gonna be done, man.

3216
02:03:06,894 --> 02:03:09,135
If you're gonna do it,
you're gonna have to get Indians

3217
02:03:09,296 --> 02:03:11,139
to come from down there
and I'm telling you upfront,

3218
02:03:11,298 --> 02:03:12,333
they're going
to jail for this."

3219
02:03:12,499 --> 02:03:15,503
When I told Fabito that,
that was enough for him.

3220
02:03:15,669 --> 02:03:16,579
He went back there,

3221
02:03:16,704 --> 02:03:18,274
and he smoothed it out
with his family,

3222
02:03:18,439 --> 02:03:20,817
and they decided with their
own stupidity as always,

3223
02:03:20,974 --> 02:03:22,510
"We'll take care
of it ourselves."

3224
02:03:22,676 --> 02:03:23,518
And they did.

3225
02:03:23,677 --> 02:03:25,816
[man] Last night,
Seal's luck ran out.

3226
02:03:25,979 --> 02:03:26,957
We was shot to death

3227
02:03:27,080 --> 02:03:29,788
outside a Salvation Army
halfway house in Baton Rouge,

3228
02:03:29,917 --> 02:03:31,692
where he had been
sentenced to spend the night

3229
02:03:31,852 --> 02:03:34,162
for 6 months
as part of his parole.

3230
02:03:34,321 --> 02:03:35,459
Seal had refused to enter

3231
02:03:35,622 --> 02:03:37,363
the government's
witness protection program.

3232
02:03:37,524 --> 02:03:39,629
The hit got farmed out
to Kubaba

3233
02:03:39,760 --> 02:03:41,797
who did of course go out
to do the murder.

3234
02:03:41,929 --> 02:03:43,465
Four Indians...
They put them on a plane,

3235
02:03:43,630 --> 02:03:44,665
they took them to Louisiana,

3236
02:03:44,832 --> 02:03:46,607
and they must have put
a hundred holes in this guy

3237
02:03:46,733 --> 02:03:48,735
outside the halfway house,
and they got caught.

3238
02:03:48,902 --> 02:03:50,438
Five Colombians
basically are caught

3239
02:03:50,570 --> 02:03:52,481
fleeing from
Barry Seal's homicide.

3240
02:03:52,639 --> 02:03:56,917
They stuck out like
sore thumbs in Baton Rouge.

3241
02:03:57,077 --> 02:03:59,990
The FBI and the Drug
Enforcement Agency tonight

3242
02:04:00,113 --> 02:04:02,354
are trying to learn
who ordered the assassination

3243
02:04:02,515 --> 02:04:04,688
of one of the government's
most important informants

3244
02:04:04,851 --> 02:04:06,228
in the war on drugs.

3245
02:04:06,386 --> 02:04:08,923
[Burstyn]
He did have a federal judge

3246
02:04:09,089 --> 02:04:12,468
in effect unwittingly
facilitate the execution

3247
02:04:12,593 --> 02:04:15,574
of a leading federal witness.

3248
02:04:15,729 --> 02:04:17,834
[man] Insofar as we've been
able to ascertain,

3249
02:04:17,964 --> 02:04:21,502
all the proper jurisprudence
and legalities were carried out

3250
02:04:21,668 --> 02:04:24,478
in the entire investigation
concerning Mr. Seal

3251
02:04:24,605 --> 02:04:26,175
and any involvement
he may have had with--

3252
02:04:26,340 --> 02:04:28,684
[Burstyn] And there's been
a lot of speculation

3253
02:04:28,809 --> 02:04:34,191
about that because of Mr. Seal's
involvement with the CIA

3254
02:04:34,348 --> 02:04:37,090
and the Communist
Nicaraguan effort,

3255
02:04:37,250 --> 02:04:40,595
and what he knew,
might have known.

3256
02:04:40,754 --> 02:04:42,756
And it certainly closed

3257
02:04:42,923 --> 02:04:47,099
a major chapter
in the cartel prosecutions.

3258
02:04:47,261 --> 02:04:49,036
The Drug Enforcement
Administration believes

3259
02:04:49,162 --> 02:04:51,972
Seal was assassinated
to prevent him from testifying

3260
02:04:52,132 --> 02:04:53,941
here in Miami,
against a suspected

3261
02:04:54,101 --> 02:04:55,978
high level Colombian trafficker,

3262
02:04:56,136 --> 02:04:59,140
whom the U.S. is trying
to extradite from Spain.

3263
02:05:01,174 --> 02:05:02,551
[Mooney]
Max getting in trouble...

3264
02:05:02,709 --> 02:05:04,120
That was the beginning
of the end.

3265
02:05:04,278 --> 02:05:06,554
Max had the bad experience
with DeLorean,

3266
02:05:06,713 --> 02:05:08,420
because he was the one
that gave DeLorean

3267
02:05:08,582 --> 02:05:10,061
the coke that DeLorean
got busted with.

3268
02:05:10,183 --> 02:05:12,163
This past year,
auto maker John DeLorean

3269
02:05:12,319 --> 02:05:14,629
was arrested on drug
trafficking charges.

3270
02:05:14,788 --> 02:05:17,166
DeLorean had said then
he was trying to raise money

3271
02:05:17,324 --> 02:05:18,997
to bail out
his struggling company.

3272
02:05:19,159 --> 02:05:20,069
Local dealers say that

3273
02:05:20,193 --> 02:05:22,173
DeLorean has become
the Edsel of the '80s,

3274
02:05:22,328 --> 02:05:24,604
and will sell only
as a collector's item.

3275
02:05:24,798 --> 02:05:26,800
Max knew he had a problem.

3276
02:05:26,967 --> 02:05:29,174
He should have smoked it,
but he didn't.

3277
02:05:29,336 --> 02:05:30,576
He didn't think
it was coming to him.

3278
02:05:30,737 --> 02:05:32,717
How could he get away with it?
He couldn't think that, you know,

3279
02:05:32,839 --> 02:05:34,716
"Hey, I gave this guy 400
and some kilos,

3280
02:05:34,841 --> 02:05:37,321
and these people are going
down like flies, and I'm okay.

3281
02:05:37,477 --> 02:05:38,979
I'm the one that gave it to them.
Nothing happened to me."

3282
02:05:39,145 --> 02:05:42,456
He had to know that there was
a problem coming from that.

3283
02:05:42,616 --> 02:05:43,560
[Munday]
And then they arrested him.

3284
02:05:43,683 --> 02:05:45,560
That was the last
we saw of Max.

3285
02:05:45,686 --> 02:05:47,324
[Roberts]
I got like millions of dollars

3286
02:05:47,488 --> 02:05:49,195
buried in garbage bags
in my lawn.

3287
02:05:49,356 --> 02:05:51,029
That night,
I'm out there with a flashlight,

3288
02:05:51,191 --> 02:05:52,465
digging up bags of money,

3289
02:05:52,626 --> 02:05:53,832
because I'm afraid
they're coming.

3290
02:05:53,993 --> 02:05:55,472
And I lived on the Everglades.

3291
02:05:55,628 --> 02:05:58,108
Ijumped in a canoe I had,
with like, I'm not exact,

3292
02:05:58,231 --> 02:05:59,835
$6 to $8 million,
threw it in the canoe,

3293
02:06:00,000 --> 02:06:01,035
paddled to the other side,

3294
02:06:01,201 --> 02:06:02,441
and buried it
in the Everglades,

3295
02:06:02,602 --> 02:06:04,013
thinking they're coming
to my house.

3296
02:06:04,170 --> 02:06:05,979
Nobody came.
Nothing happened.

3297
02:06:06,139 --> 02:06:08,050
Nobody thought it was
gonna be any problem.

3298
02:06:08,208 --> 02:06:09,346
Mickey and everybody said,

3299
02:06:09,509 --> 02:06:10,749
"Well, I haven't seen
any problems

3300
02:06:10,877 --> 02:06:12,618
with the last plane
that landed, you know?

3301
02:06:12,779 --> 02:06:13,757
Everything seemed to be fine."

3302
02:06:13,880 --> 02:06:14,824
I said, "Okay, well,

3303
02:06:14,981 --> 02:06:16,756
then let's just keep going
till we find out."

3304
02:06:16,883 --> 02:06:19,625
Jon said there was
no reason to be worried.

3305
02:06:21,021 --> 02:06:22,694
We thought Jon was so smart.

3306
02:06:24,257 --> 02:06:25,998
That's really
the truth of it.

3307
02:06:31,899 --> 02:06:33,378
I remember September 20

3308
02:06:33,533 --> 02:06:35,444
for the simple reason
that I couldn't sleep.

3309
02:06:35,569 --> 02:06:36,639
At that particular night,

3310
02:06:36,803 --> 02:06:38,840
I was working with Mickey
and his crew.

3311
02:06:39,005 --> 02:06:40,643
And because I couldn't sleep,

3312
02:06:40,807 --> 02:06:42,980
I decided that I would
go to a radio room

3313
02:06:43,109 --> 02:06:47,148
that we had set up here in Miami
to monitor the incoming planes.

3314
02:06:47,281 --> 02:06:50,660
The last trip that we were on
was to be the last trip.

3315
02:06:50,817 --> 02:06:52,854
We decided to get out
at that point,

3316
02:06:53,019 --> 02:06:55,021
because we had made
enough money.

3317
02:06:56,056 --> 02:06:59,162
Why keep taking a chance,
taking a chance?

3318
02:06:59,292 --> 02:07:00,737
Sooner or later,
they're gonna win,

3319
02:07:00,894 --> 02:07:02,066
you know, and they did.

3320
02:07:02,229 --> 02:07:03,264
It was a regular trip.

3321
02:07:03,430 --> 02:07:04,807
The only thing
that was unusual,

3322
02:07:04,931 --> 02:07:06,001
and that should have
given it away,

3323
02:07:06,132 --> 02:07:07,509
was it was real quiet
on the radio.

3324
02:07:07,667 --> 02:07:09,510
Of course, they know that
we listen to everything.

3325
02:07:09,669 --> 02:07:12,047
To tell you the truth,
I looked around when I drove up

3326
02:07:12,205 --> 02:07:13,912
because I was still
paranoid for Max,

3327
02:07:14,074 --> 02:07:15,417
and I saw nothing.

3328
02:07:15,575 --> 02:07:17,054
Nothing at all.

3329
02:07:17,210 --> 02:07:18,917
[Munday]
Everything went as usual.

3330
02:07:19,079 --> 02:07:21,685
[Roberts] The plane landed, I was
like, "Oh, man, another good trip.

3331
02:07:21,848 --> 02:07:23,293
I'm going home.
I feel great."

3332
02:07:23,450 --> 02:07:24,520
[Munday] And as soon
as the airplane landed

3333
02:07:24,684 --> 02:07:26,425
and we went in the barn,
they showed up in helicopters

3334
02:07:26,587 --> 02:07:29,534
and all kinds of people jumped
out with guns everywhere.

3335
02:07:29,689 --> 02:07:32,693
[Mooney] It was a simultaneous
bust, Tampa with Miami.

3336
02:07:32,859 --> 02:07:34,566
[Roberts] They came in there,
all in black,

3337
02:07:34,727 --> 02:07:37,071
and with these
night goggles and masks.

3338
02:07:37,230 --> 02:07:39,210
It was like, I said,
"What? Am I back in Vietnam here?

3339
02:07:39,333 --> 02:07:40,573
This is nuts."

3340
02:07:40,733 --> 02:07:42,041
[Munday]
I went out the back door--

3341
02:07:42,168 --> 02:07:43,738
--and what am I, gonna
shoot it out with you guys--

3342
02:07:43,904 --> 02:07:45,850
--after a small confrontation
with one of the guys.

3343
02:07:45,972 --> 02:07:47,451
"Get on the floor
and shut up."

3344
02:07:47,607 --> 02:07:48,449
"Yeah, all right."

3345
02:07:48,608 --> 02:07:51,054
And they looked at me
at first, and I'll never forget,

3346
02:07:51,177 --> 02:07:54,124
"Roberts,
what are you doing here?"

3347
02:07:54,281 --> 02:07:55,954
I said, "I guess I fucked up."

3348
02:07:56,115 --> 02:07:57,287
He said,
"You fucked up, man.

3349
02:07:57,450 --> 02:07:59,293
We would have
come to your house later.

3350
02:07:59,453 --> 02:08:00,898
But what are you doing,
you made it easy for us."

3351
02:08:01,021 --> 02:08:02,432
I said, "I couldn't sleep, man."

3352
02:08:02,589 --> 02:08:03,932
He said,
"Well, that's too bad."

3353
02:08:05,893 --> 02:08:08,464
And when I got downtown,
I heard on the radio,

3354
02:08:08,628 --> 02:08:10,471
"They are shooting.
there's gunfire, bang...

3355
02:08:10,630 --> 02:08:11,870
There's all kinds of war."

3356
02:08:11,998 --> 02:08:14,478
I said, "What's going on here?
Is this involving me?"

3357
02:08:14,634 --> 02:08:16,614
"That's your plane,
that's your farm up there.

3358
02:08:16,770 --> 02:08:18,078
There's gunfire,
they are shooting."

3359
02:08:18,205 --> 02:08:20,549
[Munday] They were running all over,
they were shooting guns.

3360
02:08:20,674 --> 02:08:22,711
"Your friend is
shooting at us."

3361
02:08:22,843 --> 02:08:24,151
"My friend?" "Mickey."

3362
02:08:24,310 --> 02:08:26,483
[Munday]
I tried to burn the airplane.

3363
02:08:26,646 --> 02:08:29,320
Mickey had a flare gun.
And around the plane,

3364
02:08:29,482 --> 02:08:30,756
there were gasoline tanks,

3365
02:08:30,917 --> 02:08:33,124
which were used to refuel
the plane to get out of there.

3366
02:08:33,286 --> 02:08:34,492
[Munday] I pushed one over--

3367
02:08:34,654 --> 02:08:37,498
[Roberts] Well, Mickey wanted
to escape, so he shot the flare gun.

3368
02:08:41,027 --> 02:08:43,268
[Munday] I hit the swamp.

3369
02:08:43,397 --> 02:08:44,899
And I watched the show
all day long.

3370
02:08:45,031 --> 02:08:45,907
[Roberts]
They couldn't find him.

3371
02:08:46,032 --> 02:08:47,773
And they were chasing him
through the woods all night.

3372
02:08:50,937 --> 02:08:52,746
[Singleton] Max Mermelstein
becomes a witness

3373
02:08:52,873 --> 02:08:53,783
and wants to talk about,

3374
02:08:53,940 --> 02:08:55,749
among other things,
murders in Miami.

3375
02:08:55,875 --> 02:08:57,616
We're going to
debrief this guy--

3376
02:08:57,777 --> 02:08:59,381
[Palombo]
And quite frankly, at first,

3377
02:08:59,546 --> 02:09:02,288
I didn't believe
75% of what he said.

3378
02:09:02,415 --> 02:09:04,759
It was just
too outlandish.

3379
02:09:04,884 --> 02:09:07,364
I introduced myself,
and he goes,

3380
02:09:07,520 --> 02:09:08,396
"We have met before."

3381
02:09:08,555 --> 02:09:09,533
I go, "What are
you talking about?

3382
02:09:09,689 --> 02:09:10,929
We never have met."

3383
02:09:11,057 --> 02:09:13,799
And he reminded me that we had
gone to his house in Miami Lakes

3384
02:09:13,960 --> 02:09:16,167
years prior seeking consent
to search his house.

3385
02:09:16,329 --> 02:09:18,138
And he told us
to go pound sand.

3386
02:09:18,264 --> 02:09:19,675
Yeah, it's a small world.

3387
02:09:19,832 --> 02:09:22,813
Can you state your name
for the record, your full name?

3388
02:09:22,969 --> 02:09:24,312
[Mermelstein] Max Mermelstein.

3389
02:09:24,438 --> 02:09:27,476
Max rolled over on all of us.

3390
02:09:27,640 --> 02:09:31,611
[man] As I understand it,
from 1981 to 1985,

3391
02:09:31,744 --> 02:09:34,520
you worked full time
for the cartel,

3392
02:09:34,681 --> 02:09:38,026
and imported massive
quantities of cocaine

3393
02:09:38,184 --> 02:09:39,959
into the United States.

3394
02:09:40,086 --> 02:09:44,034
How much cocaine were you
personally responsible

3395
02:09:44,190 --> 02:09:46,363
for importing
during that timeframe?

3396
02:09:46,526 --> 02:09:47,630
[Mermelstein]
During that timeframe,

3397
02:09:47,761 --> 02:09:50,571
between 55
and 56 tons of cocaine

3398
02:09:50,730 --> 02:09:51,572
went through my hands.

3399
02:09:51,731 --> 02:09:54,337
Between 55 and 56 tons.

3400
02:09:54,467 --> 02:09:56,845
I told Jon.
He didn't listen to me.

3401
02:09:57,003 --> 02:09:59,074
I told him from day 1,
that Max was weak,

3402
02:09:59,239 --> 02:10:00,445
that he will
snitch on us later,

3403
02:10:00,607 --> 02:10:01,677
you know, down the road.

3404
02:10:01,841 --> 02:10:02,979
That's why I wanted
to kill him so bad.

3405
02:10:03,109 --> 02:10:04,213
But they wouldn't let me.

3406
02:10:04,377 --> 02:10:07,085
[Mermelstein] For the most part, I
report directly to the Ochoa brothers.

3407
02:10:07,246 --> 02:10:10,056
Did you ever meet
the Ochoa brothers?

3408
02:10:10,216 --> 02:10:11,092
[Mermelstein] Oh, yes, sir.

3409
02:10:11,251 --> 02:10:13,288
[man] And Escobar was
the other name you mentioned.

3410
02:10:13,453 --> 02:10:14,591
[Mermelstein] Pablo Escobar, yes.

3411
02:10:14,754 --> 02:10:15,858
[man] Pablo Escobar.

3412
02:10:16,022 --> 02:10:19,367
First piece of information
you gave to government

3413
02:10:19,493 --> 02:10:22,997
was that the Ochoa brothers
and their organization

3414
02:10:23,129 --> 02:10:27,305
had a contract that means they
were offering money to kidnap

3415
02:10:27,467 --> 02:10:30,311
andlor kill Barry Seal.

3416
02:10:30,470 --> 02:10:33,451
It was relayed to me directly
by Fabio Ochoa Junior

3417
02:10:33,607 --> 02:10:38,078
and Rafael Cardona, along with
Pablo Escobar, personally,

3418
02:10:38,245 --> 02:10:40,247
to either kidnap him
or kill him.

3419
02:10:40,413 --> 02:10:42,620
I wasn't asked to do this.
I was told to do this.

3420
02:10:42,782 --> 02:10:44,227
The government had no idea

3421
02:10:44,350 --> 02:10:47,126
and, honest to God,
if it wasn't for Max Mermelstein--

3422
02:10:47,287 --> 02:10:49,392
[Munday] --I don't think they
would have ever caught us.

3423
02:10:49,522 --> 02:10:51,502
[man] He filled in the gaps.

3424
02:10:51,758 --> 02:10:53,863
[Roberts] They knew nothing
of where the farm was.

3425
02:10:54,060 --> 02:10:57,633
They knew nothing of our trips.
They knew nothing.

3426
02:10:57,797 --> 02:10:59,105
Max was like family.

3427
02:10:59,266 --> 02:11:01,109
I never figured
he'd do what he did.

3428
02:11:01,267 --> 02:11:04,146
The came the next day
and they busted our gate

3429
02:11:04,304 --> 02:11:05,282
and seize the house.

3430
02:11:05,438 --> 02:11:07,509
[man] We were able to seize
property in value

3431
02:11:07,674 --> 02:11:11,349
of $130 million
into Florida area.

3432
02:11:11,544 --> 02:11:14,991
[Roberts] And Max made the
indictment against Mickey and me.

3433
02:11:15,148 --> 02:11:17,253
[Mooney] When I'm reading
the indictments, I'm also

3434
02:11:17,383 --> 02:11:18,657
just like, "Holy shit."

3435
02:11:18,818 --> 02:11:22,322
I didn't realize that he was
actually working with the cartel.

3436
02:11:22,488 --> 02:11:23,660
I didn't know Rafael
was in the cartel,

3437
02:11:23,823 --> 02:11:24,801
I didn't know any of this.

3438
02:11:24,957 --> 02:11:26,334
I mean, I'm not saying
I didn't know anything,

3439
02:11:26,493 --> 02:11:28,939
I'm just saying that
nobody realized the magnitude

3440
02:11:29,095 --> 02:11:30,733
of what Jon was involved in.

3441
02:11:30,864 --> 02:11:33,674
You get on a trip when
you're making so much money,

3442
02:11:33,833 --> 02:11:35,540
that you were just so powerful
that nothing was gonna--

3443
02:11:35,702 --> 02:11:37,113
It wasn't going to happen.

3444
02:11:37,237 --> 02:11:39,080
[Ayala] Everyday I talked to her,
she said, "No, you know,

3445
02:11:39,205 --> 02:11:40,183
you were wrong,
he is not a rat."

3446
02:11:40,339 --> 02:11:41,647
I said, "He is working
for the police.

3447
02:11:41,808 --> 02:11:43,185
That's why I'm not near you.
Because you're going to go

3448
02:11:43,342 --> 02:11:44,320
to jail, but I ain't
going with you."

3449
02:11:44,477 --> 02:11:46,821
"Oh, come to Los Angeles."
I said, "No.

3450
02:11:46,980 --> 02:11:47,958
I'm all right over here."

3451
02:11:48,114 --> 02:11:52,529
[Palombo] We located a small
house that they had rented.

3452
02:11:52,685 --> 02:11:54,392
We knew that she was
in the residence,

3453
02:11:54,554 --> 02:11:58,092
so we covered the back
and the front, and in we went.

3454
02:11:58,224 --> 02:12:00,204
I went upstairs
and found her sitting in bed

3455
02:12:00,360 --> 02:12:01,395
reading the Bible.

3456
02:12:01,561 --> 02:12:02,835
And I just walked up to her.

3457
02:12:02,995 --> 02:12:04,702
Obviously I had
my weapon drawn.

3458
02:12:04,864 --> 02:12:06,309
She was pretty startled.

3459
02:12:06,432 --> 02:12:07,706
You would never think
that she was

3460
02:12:07,867 --> 02:12:10,575
a violent homicidal maniac.

3461
02:12:10,737 --> 02:12:14,014
I said, "Hola, Griselda."

3462
02:12:15,741 --> 02:12:19,848
And she said,
"No Griselda. Me llamo Betty."

3463
02:12:20,012 --> 02:12:21,548
lsaid -.
, No' no, In

3464
02:12:21,715 --> 02:12:24,355
And then I gave her
a little kiss on the cheek,

3465
02:12:24,517 --> 02:12:27,191
as I promised I would
to the agents,

3466
02:12:27,353 --> 02:12:29,731
many, many months earlier.

3467
02:12:29,889 --> 02:12:32,563
[man] Police are saying
she may be responsible

3468
02:12:32,726 --> 02:12:35,229
for as many as 200 murders.

3469
02:12:35,394 --> 02:12:36,338
They arrested her at home.

3470
02:12:36,462 --> 02:12:38,874
Days later,
they arrested her kids.

3471
02:12:39,032 --> 02:12:40,602
Everything crumbled for real,
you know?

3472
02:12:40,767 --> 02:12:42,371
I'm just looking now
for myself.

3473
02:12:42,535 --> 02:12:43,741
Everybody is in prison,
except me.

3474
02:12:43,904 --> 02:12:45,975
And they're looking
for me now.

3475
02:12:46,105 --> 02:12:49,450
Around the 15th of December,
I was just laying low.

3476
02:12:49,609 --> 02:12:51,247
Next thing my brother is
knocking at the door.

3477
02:12:51,411 --> 02:12:54,358
He says, "The police
are downstairs."

3478
02:12:54,481 --> 02:12:56,154
I said, "The police?
What they want?"

3479
02:12:56,283 --> 02:12:58,456
He said, "They're downstairs."

3480
02:12:58,618 --> 02:13:01,531
I followed him downstairs. They had
a four black flatbed trucks.

3481
02:13:01,654 --> 02:13:03,156
They were picking all my cars.

3482
02:13:03,289 --> 02:13:06,099
I had two Corvettes,
a Porsche and a Supra.

3483
02:13:06,259 --> 02:13:07,260
They were picking them up,
in the flatbed.

3484
02:13:07,426 --> 02:13:08,530
So I yelled to the guy.

3485
02:13:08,662 --> 02:13:10,300
I said, "What the fuck
are you doing with my cars?"

3486
02:13:10,463 --> 02:13:12,773
When the guy turns,
he's got a Windbreaker.

3487
02:13:12,933 --> 02:13:15,038
It said on the back,
"Special Agent, DEA."

3488
02:13:15,201 --> 02:13:18,614
I said, "No, never mind.
Don't worry about it.

3489
02:13:18,771 --> 02:13:19,875
They are not mine."

3490
02:13:20,039 --> 02:13:21,040
I went back inside the house.

3491
02:13:21,207 --> 02:13:23,278
I had a kilo and a half
for my personal use.

3492
02:13:23,443 --> 02:13:25,650
So I flushed
the kilo cocaine down the toilet.

3493
02:13:25,811 --> 02:13:26,789
I threw the silencer
on my gun...

3494
02:13:26,946 --> 02:13:28,550
And I throw it over the water,
because I live in the bay.

3495
02:13:28,681 --> 02:13:30,922
I put the gun back.
It's a .45.

3496
02:13:31,084 --> 02:13:33,064
Also, one car they left behind.
This one when I met my wife,

3497
02:13:33,219 --> 02:13:35,324
and she had a Mazda.
They didn't touch that car.

3498
02:13:35,955 --> 02:13:37,298
I said to my brother,
"Let's just go and get arrested.

3499
02:13:37,457 --> 02:13:38,435
Fuck it."

3500
02:13:38,592 --> 02:13:40,037
So we went down the elevator.
We get out, it was dark.

3501
02:13:40,160 --> 02:13:42,197
Nobody around.
So we got into the car...

3502
02:13:43,596 --> 02:13:44,904
I start driving.
I ask my brother if some--

3503
02:13:45,064 --> 02:13:46,270
He said,
"No, nobody is behind us."

3504
02:13:46,432 --> 02:13:48,935
We get to the airport.
A cop pulls up.

3505
02:13:49,102 --> 02:13:53,073
He was a short guy, 5'6", you know?
He screams my name.

3506
02:13:53,239 --> 02:13:54,684
"Jorge Ayala.
You're under arrest."

3507
02:13:54,840 --> 02:13:56,683
I pretend
I didn't hear him.

3508
02:13:56,843 --> 02:13:58,584
I keep on walking,
but he's scared at that time.

3509
02:13:58,711 --> 02:14:00,691
They already know who I am.

3510
02:14:00,846 --> 02:14:02,154
He didn't wait for back up,
he just wanted to be hero.

3511
02:14:02,315 --> 02:14:03,350
He screams again.

3512
02:14:03,516 --> 02:14:05,462
"You, with the red Windbreaker."
So I turned.

3513
02:14:05,618 --> 02:14:06,596
I said, "Are you talking to me?"

3514
02:14:06,720 --> 02:14:07,824
He said, "Yeah, you,
you're under arrest."

3515
02:14:07,987 --> 02:14:09,523
I said, "For what?"

3516
02:14:09,689 --> 02:14:12,465
He says,
"We'll let you know later."

3517
02:14:12,625 --> 02:14:13,660
So I started laughing.

3518
02:14:13,826 --> 02:14:14,896
I said,
"Go fuck yourself."

3519
02:14:15,027 --> 02:14:17,837
I ran, and the dog
caught up with me.

3520
02:14:17,997 --> 02:14:20,102
They took us into custody
to the county jail.

3521
02:14:20,266 --> 02:14:22,371
And ever since then,
I've been in custody.

3522
02:14:23,569 --> 02:14:26,846
After Max cooperated,
pilots started cooperating,

3523
02:14:27,006 --> 02:14:28,610
ground crew guys
started cooperating,

3524
02:14:28,741 --> 02:14:30,186
and everybody
was testifying

3525
02:14:30,343 --> 02:14:32,448
and cutting deals
to get less time.

3526
02:14:32,578 --> 02:14:34,182
I had now become
the main focus

3527
02:14:34,347 --> 02:14:36,725
because I was the one putting
the coke on the plane for him.

3528
02:14:36,883 --> 02:14:38,988
They were going to give me
like 30 years.

3529
02:14:39,152 --> 02:14:40,130
I mean, you didn't have to be a,

3530
02:14:40,286 --> 02:14:43,631
a rocket scientist
to figure out it's time to,

3531
02:14:43,756 --> 02:14:45,963
you know, blow dodge and get
the hell out of here and--

3532
02:14:46,125 --> 02:14:47,502
I went for a bond hearing
and they said,

3533
02:14:47,660 --> 02:14:50,641
"You're not getting a bond,
forget about it." And that was that.

3534
02:14:50,764 --> 02:14:51,742
About a week later,

3535
02:14:51,898 --> 02:14:53,468
Dick Gregory comes
with two FBI agents:

3536
02:14:53,600 --> 02:14:54,510
this guy Joe Walsh,

3537
02:14:54,667 --> 02:14:56,146
who is heading up the case,
and another agent.

3538
02:14:56,302 --> 02:14:58,839
And they said,
"Look, we really want Munday."

3539
02:14:59,005 --> 02:15:01,178
Because he embarrassed them
by shooting his flare off

3540
02:15:01,374 --> 02:15:02,284
and all this other...

3541
02:15:02,408 --> 02:15:04,115
and they think he was trying
to kill him and everything.

3542
02:15:04,243 --> 02:15:05,881
So I said:
"if you give me a bond,

3543
02:15:06,045 --> 02:15:07,115
I'll help you get Mickey."

3544
02:15:07,246 --> 02:15:09,123
I go to Mickey's brother.

3545
02:15:09,248 --> 02:15:11,888
And I went without telling them
that I was going.

3546
02:15:12,051 --> 02:15:13,758
I snuck out again
in the disguise

3547
02:15:13,920 --> 02:15:15,763
with another thing,
and I tell Mickey's brother,

3548
02:15:15,922 --> 02:15:18,027
"Listen to me,
you got to work with me,

3549
02:15:18,190 --> 02:15:20,170
I'm never going
to lead them to Mickey,

3550
02:15:20,326 --> 02:15:23,603
but they have to believe
for the next month or two months

3551
02:15:23,763 --> 02:15:25,174
that I'm going
to get them Mickey,

3552
02:15:25,331 --> 02:15:28,312
and you have to be able to work
with me to do this

3553
02:15:28,434 --> 02:15:30,778
because I need time to get
all my shit together

3554
02:15:30,936 --> 02:15:32,006
because I'm getting
out of here.

3555
02:15:32,172 --> 02:15:34,448
And I'll help Mickey
with whatever he needs."

3556
02:15:34,607 --> 02:15:35,915
Because Mickey needed papers.

3557
02:15:36,075 --> 02:15:38,055
He was a fugitive, and he knew
I can get him papers.

3558
02:15:38,210 --> 02:15:39,621
"In a week
I'll give you every thing,

3559
02:15:39,779 --> 02:15:41,622
the documents you need
so Mickey can live

3560
02:15:41,781 --> 02:15:43,021
as a different person."

3561
02:15:43,182 --> 02:15:45,423
So Mickey's brother goes
to Mickey and Mickey says, "Great."

3562
02:15:45,585 --> 02:15:47,690
"He knows you won't give
him up. Let's do it."

3563
02:15:47,820 --> 02:15:50,323
[Munday] It took, may be a week
or two weeks.

3564
02:15:50,456 --> 02:15:52,094
I mean, I'd to get
myself settled in.

3565
02:15:52,258 --> 02:15:53,202
Fortunately,
they showed my picture

3566
02:15:53,359 --> 02:15:55,270
from the driver's license.

3567
02:15:55,428 --> 02:15:58,568
I'm funny looking,
but that was really a bad picture.

3568
02:15:58,731 --> 02:15:59,801
Well, I had it arranged

3569
02:15:59,966 --> 02:16:01,536
that I was going to meet
Mickey's brother.

3570
02:16:01,667 --> 02:16:04,273
I made a phone call,
with the FBI listening.

3571
02:16:04,437 --> 02:16:05,347
"Hey, what's up?

3572
02:16:05,472 --> 02:16:07,611
I'm going to meet you
tomorrow over here at Denny's.

3573
02:16:07,773 --> 02:16:09,548
Okay, we'll meet at Denny's."
So I meet him.

3574
02:16:09,676 --> 02:16:12,418
He knows they're following me
and everything. And we talk.

3575
02:16:12,578 --> 02:16:13,579
And now I have a bug,

3576
02:16:13,746 --> 02:16:15,555
and they're recording all this,

3577
02:16:15,682 --> 02:16:16,626
and everything is going fine.

3578
02:16:16,782 --> 02:16:18,125
I go back to them.
And this guy,

3579
02:16:18,284 --> 02:16:19,228
"Good, you're working with us."

3580
02:16:19,385 --> 02:16:20,728
He says, "Well,
I'm going to tell you.

3581
02:16:20,854 --> 02:16:23,027
I will find you wherever
you are if you take off."

3582
02:16:23,155 --> 02:16:24,498
"Why would you think
I'm gonna take off?"

3583
02:16:24,657 --> 02:16:26,967
"Because Max tells us that
you're full of shit.

3584
02:16:27,126 --> 02:16:27,968
You're not going to cooperate,

3585
02:16:28,128 --> 02:16:29,198
you're going to take off."

3586
02:16:29,329 --> 02:16:30,967
I'm thinking to myself,
Max is finally doing

3587
02:16:31,131 --> 02:16:32,610
something correct here,
you know.

3588
02:16:32,765 --> 02:16:34,608
But I'm not going
to tell them.

3589
02:16:34,767 --> 02:16:37,373
I dragged it on with meetings,
and them following me,

3590
02:16:37,504 --> 02:16:39,211
and following him to nowhere.

3591
02:16:39,338 --> 02:16:40,976
The last time they were
going to get him, I said,

3592
02:16:41,140 --> 02:16:42,380
"He is going to have
his brother here,

3593
02:16:42,508 --> 02:16:43,418
and you guys
are going to get him."

3594
02:16:43,542 --> 02:16:45,453
And the plan that I had
with Mickey's brother was

3595
02:16:45,612 --> 02:16:50,823
to pull over and meet a guy
who has the same description

3596
02:16:50,983 --> 02:16:53,623
as Mickey, and when
they met that guy,

3597
02:16:53,786 --> 02:16:55,424
that's when everybody
was going to close in.

3598
02:16:55,554 --> 02:16:58,000
It worked, man.
They converged on Mickey's brother

3599
02:16:58,157 --> 02:17:00,103
and this other poor guy,
who didn't even know

3600
02:17:00,259 --> 02:17:01,761
what was going on.

3601
02:17:01,894 --> 02:17:03,237
And they said,
"You, we got you."

3602
02:17:03,362 --> 02:17:05,842
And I'm looking. And Joe Walsh,
"That's not Mickey Munday."

3603
02:17:05,998 --> 02:17:08,638
And they went crazy, man.
They came and they grab me.

3604
02:17:08,801 --> 02:17:09,973
I said, "What are
you talking about?

3605
02:17:10,136 --> 02:17:11,706
I did everything
I was supposed to do,

3606
02:17:11,871 --> 02:17:14,010
and now how am I going
to get Mickey for you?"

3607
02:17:14,173 --> 02:17:15,846
And that was
a my way out, right?

3608
02:17:16,008 --> 02:17:18,488
That I try to cooperate
but this is what happened.

3609
02:17:18,644 --> 02:17:20,146
And they said to me,
"We should lock you up now."

3610
02:17:20,312 --> 02:17:21,723
I said, "Why?
If I was going to take off,

3611
02:17:21,881 --> 02:17:22,859
I would have taken off.

3612
02:17:23,015 --> 02:17:25,655
You guys told me you'd
help me, I tried to help you.

3613
02:17:25,818 --> 02:17:27,024
My trial is coming in Tampa,

3614
02:17:27,186 --> 02:17:29,427
I will be there
for the first day in my trial."

3615
02:17:29,555 --> 02:17:31,626
I said, "You guys
better help me."

3616
02:17:31,758 --> 02:17:33,260
"okay."

3617
02:17:33,393 --> 02:17:35,430
First day of my trial came,
I was history.

3618
02:17:35,561 --> 02:17:38,633
I left Dodge so quick,
like three days before my trial.

3619
02:17:38,764 --> 02:17:39,902
I was in Colombia.

3620
02:17:40,066 --> 02:17:41,670
I had all the money in Panama,

3621
02:17:41,834 --> 02:17:44,041
plus I had money in Colombia,
and money wasn't a question.

3622
02:17:44,203 --> 02:17:47,047
So, they send a plane.
I got on a plane.

3623
02:17:47,206 --> 02:17:49,743
I went to Colombia, and for
about a week it was all right.

3624
02:17:49,909 --> 02:17:52,014
I lived on a farm out there,
one of Rafael's farms.

3625
02:17:52,178 --> 02:17:53,452
It was great,
I had servants,

3626
02:17:53,579 --> 02:17:55,286
I had, you know, women,

3627
02:17:55,414 --> 02:17:57,325
you know, whatever,
great food, I had a cook.

3628
02:17:57,483 --> 02:17:58,325
And then all of a sudden,

3629
02:17:58,484 --> 02:17:59,519
I remember waking up
one morning,

3630
02:17:59,685 --> 02:18:01,824
and they said,
"Hurry up, get in the car."

3631
02:18:01,954 --> 02:18:04,195
We pulled out, and all of sudden
I heard: [MIMICS GUNFIRE]

3632
02:18:04,357 --> 02:18:06,337
When I looked around,
everywhere there were

3633
02:18:06,492 --> 02:18:09,405
just government guys
firing at the car.

3634
02:18:09,562 --> 02:18:11,701
And Rafael's guys are firing back
at the government cars.

3635
02:18:11,864 --> 02:18:14,242
And we got out of there,
and they took me to another farm.

3636
02:18:14,400 --> 02:18:15,504
And this went on for weeks.

3637
02:18:15,735 --> 02:18:17,305
It was when the
American government

3638
02:18:17,437 --> 02:18:20,577
put so much pressure on the
Colombians, because they said,

3639
02:18:20,740 --> 02:18:22,219
"We're not going to give you
any more money"

3640
02:18:22,375 --> 02:18:23,581
that they were trying to like,

3641
02:18:23,743 --> 02:18:25,916
sort of make a half-ass
attempt to crack down.

3642
02:18:26,078 --> 02:18:27,421
[man] Another
law enforcement approach

3643
02:18:27,580 --> 02:18:28,957
involves greater cooperation

3644
02:18:29,115 --> 02:18:31,755
between American
and Colombian authorities.

3645
02:18:31,918 --> 02:18:33,898
We need to get
the State Department active

3646
02:18:34,053 --> 02:18:37,523
in letting every country know
where drugs are coming from,

3647
02:18:37,656 --> 02:18:39,602
and that we're going to assess
our relationship with them

3648
02:18:39,758 --> 02:18:42,432
based on what they are
doing to clean up those drugs.

3649
02:18:42,595 --> 02:18:44,097
[Roberts] And the war
started in Colombia,

3650
02:18:44,263 --> 02:18:46,209
and I went from one place
to the next.

3651
02:18:46,365 --> 02:18:47,901
I finally told Mike,
"I can't,

3652
02:18:48,067 --> 02:18:49,444
this is crazy.
I should have just stayed in jail."

3653
02:18:49,602 --> 02:18:52,048
Everyday there is a guns
going off, machine guns.

3654
02:18:52,271 --> 02:18:53,978
I had friends in Mexico.
And I went to Mexico

3655
02:18:54,140 --> 02:18:55,744
and they told me,
"You become a Mexican citizen

3656
02:18:55,941 --> 02:18:57,784
and no problem,
you'll live here."

3657
02:18:57,944 --> 02:19:01,084
So I lived there for while
and that was great.

3658
02:19:01,247 --> 02:19:04,660
For some reason, the government
had a bug up their ass.

3659
02:19:04,817 --> 02:19:06,990
The guy started with
"The 10 Most Wanted of America."

3660
02:19:07,153 --> 02:19:08,188
They put
a picture of me up,

3661
02:19:08,320 --> 02:19:11,392
and they started offering
everybody rewards to get me.

3662
02:19:11,557 --> 02:19:13,127
I knew that was
the end of my time

3663
02:19:13,292 --> 02:19:14,896
because, you know,
they were offering money,

3664
02:19:15,027 --> 02:19:16,734
and Mexicans
didn't have anything.

3665
02:19:16,862 --> 02:19:18,603
And I knew it was
only a matter of time.

3666
02:19:18,764 --> 02:19:20,243
They put me
in this jail down there

3667
02:19:20,399 --> 02:19:24,745
and gave me a chef,
they give me three cells,

3668
02:19:24,871 --> 02:19:27,374
they built refrigerators,
they let me build the gym.

3669
02:19:27,507 --> 02:19:29,487
And I stayed there 11 months
fighting the government

3670
02:19:29,642 --> 02:19:31,781
and eventually
obviously I lost

3671
02:19:31,944 --> 02:19:33,321
and the government
brought me back.

3672
02:19:33,479 --> 02:19:36,289
And we made a deal
and they gave me 15 years,

3673
02:19:36,449 --> 02:19:37,655
which to me was,
you know, I thought,

3674
02:19:37,816 --> 02:19:39,159
well, I thought,
I was going to get five

3675
02:19:39,318 --> 02:19:42,026
but, you know,
it's a little bit of a dream.

3676
02:19:42,955 --> 02:19:44,935
And I remember
the day he was,

3677
02:19:45,057 --> 02:19:47,936
you know, sitting in the chair
crying like a baby

3678
02:19:48,060 --> 02:19:50,040
that he had to leave
everything he loved.

3679
02:19:50,195 --> 02:19:53,802
[Roberts] I have nobody
to blame but myself, nobody.

3680
02:19:53,966 --> 02:19:55,673
Time to go, you got to go.

3681
02:20:05,311 --> 02:20:07,689
[Burstyn] As drug merchants
were being prosecuted,

3682
02:20:07,846 --> 02:20:11,316
convicted and imprisoned,
a remarkable thing happened.

3683
02:20:11,484 --> 02:20:14,328
The businesses that they
frequented and supported

3684
02:20:14,487 --> 02:20:16,489
started drying up
and closing down.

3685
02:20:16,655 --> 02:20:18,965
All of the night clubs
dried up,

3686
02:20:19,091 --> 02:20:22,038
car dealerships
started to go broke.

3687
02:20:22,194 --> 02:20:24,435
Jewelry shops,
and that collapse

3688
02:20:24,563 --> 02:20:26,873
created new opportunity.

3689
02:20:28,501 --> 02:20:31,914
The economy of Miami was kept
together by speculators

3690
02:20:32,070 --> 02:20:34,676
who had made a lot of money
in the drug trades.

3691
02:20:34,840 --> 02:20:37,616
If you were a car dealer
the sales went from

3692
02:20:37,743 --> 02:20:41,486
20 million a year to 60 million
a year for 10 years,

3693
02:20:41,647 --> 02:20:42,819
you've got an extra

3694
02:20:42,948 --> 02:20:44,723
half a billion dollars
kicking around.

3695
02:20:44,883 --> 02:20:46,829
Cocaine brought
a lot of money to town.

3696
02:20:46,953 --> 02:20:49,832
[man] 92 multinational
corporations have moved

3697
02:20:49,956 --> 02:20:51,367
their South American
headquarters

3698
02:20:51,524 --> 02:20:53,367
to places like Coral Gables.

3699
02:20:53,525 --> 02:20:55,505
[Potter] I think what drew other
Latin American investment here

3700
02:20:55,661 --> 02:20:58,471
was the relative safety
of the American banking system

3701
02:20:58,597 --> 02:20:59,701
and this is the closest point

3702
02:20:59,865 --> 02:21:01,708
in the United States
to Latin America,

3703
02:21:01,867 --> 02:21:03,744
so it became a banking center
for that reason.

3704
02:21:03,903 --> 02:21:06,383
[man 1] They prefer South Florida
as a place to spend,

3705
02:21:06,539 --> 02:21:08,348
relax and to do business.

3706
02:21:08,507 --> 02:21:10,578
[man 2] Miami is trying to become
an international city

3707
02:21:10,743 --> 02:21:12,654
and it's broadening
its economic base

3708
02:21:12,778 --> 02:21:14,086
in international banking.

3709
02:21:14,246 --> 02:21:15,953
[man 3] Miami is in the middle
of an explosion.

3710
02:21:16,114 --> 02:21:18,390
A lot of that money
was cocaine money too,

3711
02:21:18,551 --> 02:21:20,087
but I'm not sure
that those two are linked

3712
02:21:20,252 --> 02:21:21,492
as one following the other.

3713
02:21:21,620 --> 02:21:23,099
It built half the city.

3714
02:21:23,255 --> 02:21:25,701
It built the high-rises,
it built the scrapes.

3715
02:21:25,825 --> 02:21:30,137
I'm going to work one day,
and I come onto Interstate 95

3716
02:21:30,295 --> 02:21:34,903
which gives me a beautiful view
of all of downtown Miami.

3717
02:21:35,067 --> 02:21:37,047
Look at this and we counted

3718
02:21:37,169 --> 02:21:43,051
22 construction cranes
on the horizon,

3719
02:21:43,175 --> 02:21:44,415
where we could see.

3720
02:21:44,577 --> 02:21:45,521
And I said,

3721
02:21:45,644 --> 02:21:48,147
I wonder how much
of this is drug money.

3722
02:21:48,314 --> 02:21:50,385
The drug trade saved Miami
in a lot of ways.

3723
02:21:50,549 --> 02:21:53,155
If you look out at the skyline,
a lot of this real estate

3724
02:21:53,318 --> 02:21:56,765
was bought and paid for
with drug money.

3725
02:21:56,922 --> 02:22:00,768
The drug trade certainly
put Miami on the map.

3726
02:22:00,926 --> 02:22:02,564
[Singleton] There is probably
no analogy to Miami

3727
02:22:02,728 --> 02:22:04,708
in the '70s and '80s,

3728
02:22:04,830 --> 02:22:07,106
other than maybe
Chicago in roaring '20s.

3729
02:22:07,265 --> 02:22:09,472
The place took
on a new cache.

3730
02:22:09,635 --> 02:22:11,615
And it's also Casablanca

3731
02:22:11,770 --> 02:22:13,545
because you had
international intrigue.

3732
02:22:13,672 --> 02:22:16,175
[Potter] It became a new
Casablanca, kind of a place

3733
02:22:16,341 --> 02:22:17,945
where you can come
and be near danger

3734
02:22:18,110 --> 02:22:19,088
but not get hurt.

3735
02:22:19,211 --> 02:22:22,454
[man] Suddenly Miami
seems exotic, glamorous,

3736
02:22:22,615 --> 02:22:24,595
even a trifle dangerous.

3737
02:22:24,750 --> 02:22:26,457
It just had everything.

3738
02:22:26,618 --> 02:22:29,155
[Potter] Along came
the TV show Miami Vice.

3739
02:22:29,321 --> 02:22:30,959
The city leaders
were mortified

3740
02:22:31,123 --> 02:22:33,967
after the Colombian drug war
and Mariel and all that.

3741
02:22:34,126 --> 02:22:35,605
But now there was going
to be a TV show

3742
02:22:35,761 --> 02:22:36,865
that could look at all that.

3743
02:22:37,029 --> 02:22:40,203
[man] The issue is tourists,
and whether watching this show

3744
02:22:40,366 --> 02:22:41,606
will make them
less likely to visit

3745
02:22:41,767 --> 02:22:43,644
Miami Beach in South Florida.

3746
02:22:43,802 --> 02:22:46,043
But what their
TV show did actually

3747
02:22:46,204 --> 02:22:48,844
was it glorified Miami.

3748
02:22:49,008 --> 02:22:51,318
No earth tones,
everything was in magenta

3749
02:22:51,477 --> 02:22:53,753
and aqua and beautiful colors

3750
02:22:53,879 --> 02:22:55,984
and it made an
attractive place to come

3751
02:22:56,148 --> 02:22:59,823
and all of a sudden Miami
became a top draw again.

3752
02:22:59,985 --> 02:23:01,589
We have seen
a resurgence in tourists.

3753
02:23:01,720 --> 02:23:03,358
We've seen that change.

3754
02:23:03,522 --> 02:23:05,866
South Beach for example
is undergoing a major change.

3755
02:23:06,025 --> 02:23:08,596
And modeling agencies
setting up on South Beach,

3756
02:23:08,727 --> 02:23:11,230
South Beach explodes
as a destination.

3757
02:23:11,396 --> 02:23:15,208
In one of America's most famous
and feted beach resorts,

3758
02:23:15,367 --> 02:23:17,313
it is suddenly
spring time again.

3759
02:23:17,469 --> 02:23:19,039
[man] Miami Beach is back.

3760
02:23:19,204 --> 02:23:22,481
Its broad wide sands
a playground once again.

3761
02:23:22,641 --> 02:23:24,643
[woman] It's used to be
just old people,

3762
02:23:24,810 --> 02:23:26,255
bad neighborhood,
it was a bad neighborhood.

3763
02:23:26,411 --> 02:23:27,481
And now it's so nice.

3764
02:23:27,646 --> 02:23:30,718
[Potter] And so in a very
odd way over the years,

3765
02:23:30,883 --> 02:23:32,157
it might have
actually helped tourism.

3766
02:23:32,284 --> 02:23:33,888
This is a weird place
in that regard.

3767
02:23:34,052 --> 02:23:35,497
[Buchanan] I think
we could had a renaissance

3768
02:23:35,654 --> 02:23:37,634
without so many people
having to die for it.

3769
02:23:39,425 --> 02:23:40,403
I could have lived without it

3770
02:23:40,559 --> 02:23:42,095
and so could a lot
of other people have lived

3771
02:23:42,261 --> 02:23:44,673
without the enormous
contribution of money

3772
02:23:44,830 --> 02:23:46,275
to this community.

3773
02:23:46,431 --> 02:23:48,274
It was too much
collateral damage.

3774
02:23:48,434 --> 02:23:50,038
I still love Miami,

3775
02:23:50,202 --> 02:23:53,046
but I think I love it more
for what it was

3776
02:23:53,205 --> 02:23:54,684
before the cocaine wars.

3777
02:23:54,840 --> 02:23:57,047
I mean,
at what price is skyline?

3778
02:23:57,209 --> 02:24:01,180
How many people have to die
for a shining skyline?

3779
02:24:01,313 --> 02:24:03,691
It wasn't worth it,
too many people died for it.

3780
02:24:07,719 --> 02:24:10,427
CENTAC 26
was extremely successful

3781
02:24:10,589 --> 02:24:14,264
and I think it was
in its success

3782
02:24:14,426 --> 02:24:15,530
that it found its end.

3783
02:24:15,694 --> 02:24:19,836
Well, Raul, he was CENTAC 26
and when he left,

3784
02:24:19,965 --> 02:24:21,137
it was devastating.

3785
02:24:21,300 --> 02:24:24,838
I left CENTAC
as a result of not one,

3786
02:24:24,970 --> 02:24:30,044
but many investigations,
in which I was a subject.

3787
02:24:30,175 --> 02:24:32,212
Involved in allegation
of some type of impropriety

3788
02:24:32,344 --> 02:24:33,288
with an informant.

3789
02:24:33,445 --> 02:24:36,585
I was placed under
investigation by

3790
02:24:36,748 --> 02:24:40,924
I guess every agency
under the sun in Dade County,

3791
02:24:41,086 --> 02:24:43,157
because of allegations
that were made against me

3792
02:24:43,322 --> 02:24:45,461
by people whom
I have put in jail.

3793
02:24:45,624 --> 02:24:47,160
He was definitely the heart
and soul of that squad,

3794
02:24:47,326 --> 02:24:48,168
there's no question
about that.

3795
02:24:48,326 --> 02:24:51,102
I was cleared
of any criminal wrongdoing

3796
02:24:51,263 --> 02:24:52,867
in all the investigations.

3797
02:24:52,998 --> 02:24:55,706
You know, I was told that
one of the main problems

3798
02:24:55,834 --> 02:24:58,280
I had was that I had
casted a shadow upwards.

3799
02:24:58,437 --> 02:25:01,577
I lost faith
in the department and I left

3800
02:25:01,740 --> 02:25:03,879
and I became
a private investigator

3801
02:25:04,009 --> 02:25:06,990
and you know, thank God,
things have been very successful

3802
02:25:07,145 --> 02:25:09,125
and I feel very good about it.

3803
02:25:15,154 --> 02:25:16,497
I came back here
'cause I had to come back,

3804
02:25:16,655 --> 02:25:17,599
I had no choice.

3805
02:25:17,756 --> 02:25:19,736
And when I first got out,
I'll never forget,

3806
02:25:19,858 --> 02:25:20,996
I went into the Surf comber,

3807
02:25:21,159 --> 02:25:23,730
and the first morning I woke up,
I remember going to the beach.

3808
02:25:23,862 --> 02:25:26,365
I was laying there and here comes
this girl out of the water

3809
02:25:26,532 --> 02:25:27,636
and as she is walking
out of the water,

3810
02:25:27,799 --> 02:25:29,642
I see she's got no top on.

3811
02:25:29,801 --> 02:25:31,337
And you got to realize,
I'm in jail now

3812
02:25:31,503 --> 02:25:33,278
11 years or something
and I'm looking at this girl

3813
02:25:33,405 --> 02:25:34,907
with no top on
and I'm saying my God,

3814
02:25:35,040 --> 02:25:37,213
I got scared,
I ran back to the room

3815
02:25:37,376 --> 02:25:38,616
and I wouldn't even
come out of the room

3816
02:25:38,777 --> 02:25:40,154
for like a day, I was so like,

3817
02:25:40,312 --> 02:25:41,655
what happened,
the whole world

3818
02:25:41,813 --> 02:25:43,190
has changed here,
you know.

3819
02:25:48,654 --> 02:25:50,395
You know, a lot of people
I know that you know,

3820
02:25:50,556 --> 02:25:51,694
they're not around anymore.

3821
02:25:51,857 --> 02:25:53,165
My friends that
we grew up together,

3822
02:25:53,325 --> 02:25:54,201
they're all dead.

3823
02:25:54,359 --> 02:25:55,394
They got killed.

3824
02:26:02,234 --> 02:26:04,805
[Munday] What I lost out of this
thing was of course almost 9 years

3825
02:26:04,970 --> 02:26:08,941
and I'm still on paper,
still having to report in.

3826
02:26:13,078 --> 02:26:14,648
Do I regret anything?

3827
02:26:14,813 --> 02:26:17,384
Sure, we messed up
a lot of people.

3828
02:26:17,549 --> 02:26:20,325
A lot of my friends because
of the business we got into.

3829
02:26:20,452 --> 02:26:22,796
They lost a lot of time,
went to jail.

3830
02:26:22,921 --> 02:26:24,423
I think the biggest thing
that I've lost

3831
02:26:24,590 --> 02:26:27,036
other than the time was when I--
went away as a fugitive,

3832
02:26:27,192 --> 02:26:29,331
I met a really
wonderful young woman.

3833
02:26:29,461 --> 02:26:31,270
And because of this
I lost her.

3834
02:26:31,430 --> 02:26:35,537
I've never met anybody
quite like her before.

3835
02:26:35,701 --> 02:26:37,271
And maybe one day
I'll get lucky enough

3836
02:26:37,436 --> 02:26:39,712
to find something
but I don't know.

3837
02:26:39,871 --> 02:26:42,351
That was what
I missed the most.

3838
02:26:42,474 --> 02:26:44,351
But then the other way
to look at it was,

3839
02:26:44,476 --> 02:26:47,821
I'd have never met her
if I hadn't had this problem.

3840
02:26:47,946 --> 02:26:49,857
If I didn't have my son,

3841
02:26:50,015 --> 02:26:51,221
you know, maybe
I'd look to ways

3842
02:26:51,383 --> 02:26:53,727
to screw the government again.

3843
02:26:53,885 --> 02:26:56,729
But now they're so far
advanced in everything,

3844
02:26:56,888 --> 02:26:58,094
you know, I don't want
to go back to jail

3845
02:26:58,256 --> 02:27:00,463
or so -- you know,
it's a whole different trip now.

3846
02:27:07,866 --> 02:27:11,109
At the time it was an
unbelievable adventure.

3847
02:27:11,270 --> 02:27:14,945
We did things that you
couldn't even imagine

3848
02:27:15,107 --> 02:27:16,484
that you could do.

3849
02:27:16,641 --> 02:27:18,587
We'd go and see.

3850
02:27:18,743 --> 02:27:21,121
It will take me a month
to get all that shit back again

3851
02:27:21,279 --> 02:27:23,281
but it's just not worth it.

3852
02:27:27,786 --> 02:27:32,496
Mr. Perez you have three
counts of first degree murder.

3853
02:27:32,658 --> 02:27:33,762
No bond.

3854
02:27:33,926 --> 02:27:37,396
A lot of these Mariel criminals
that were arrested

3855
02:27:37,529 --> 02:27:40,635
in the early and mid 1980s

3856
02:27:40,799 --> 02:27:42,972
got sentenced
to 10, 15, 20 years.

3857
02:27:43,135 --> 02:27:44,637
They're starting
to get out now.

3858
02:27:44,803 --> 02:27:46,908
[Singleton]
Given the right provocation,

3859
02:27:47,072 --> 02:27:48,779
who knows
what he might do again.

3860
02:27:48,940 --> 02:27:50,283
I get a call
from a gentleman

3861
02:27:50,442 --> 02:27:52,046
who wants me
to polygraph somebody.

3862
02:27:52,177 --> 02:27:54,418
We meet a few days later
and he says,

3863
02:27:54,546 --> 02:27:55,422
"Are you Nelson Andrew,

3864
02:27:55,547 --> 02:27:57,049
you used to be
homicide detective.'

3865
02:27:57,182 --> 02:27:59,059
'And I'm yeah, he says,
"You don't remember me?"

3866
02:27:59,184 --> 02:28:00,925
I don't know.

3867
02:28:01,086 --> 02:28:02,429
He says,
"I just got out of jail,

3868
02:28:02,554 --> 02:28:04,966
I did 15 years
because of you.

3869
02:28:09,294 --> 02:28:11,001
He's out.

3870
02:28:11,162 --> 02:28:12,163
He's out.

3871
02:28:13,198 --> 02:28:14,370
It's scary.

3872
02:28:15,967 --> 02:28:18,777
I went to Miami I pleaded guilty
to the three murders.

3873
02:28:18,937 --> 02:28:22,180
A life sentence on each case
to be served concurrently.

3874
02:28:22,340 --> 02:28:23,785
I've been here ever since.

3875
02:28:28,580 --> 02:28:30,821
[Singleton] When he flipped
and told us chapter and verse

3876
02:28:30,982 --> 02:28:32,325
about all these
different homicides

3877
02:28:32,484 --> 02:28:33,827
and how she ordered them.

3878
02:28:33,985 --> 02:28:34,963
Then she was done.

3879
02:28:35,120 --> 02:28:36,758
She was essentially
our John Gotti.

3880
02:28:36,888 --> 02:28:39,334
And Rivi was our
Sammy "The Bull" Gravano.

3881
02:28:54,139 --> 02:28:55,049
There's certainly
nobody more deserving

3882
02:28:55,206 --> 02:28:56,184
of the death penalty
than she is,

3883
02:28:56,341 --> 02:28:57,479
she should be on death row.

3884
02:28:57,609 --> 02:29:00,852
But, I take a little bit
of comfort in the fact that

3885
02:29:01,013 --> 02:29:03,857
at least till I retire
she will still be in prison.

3886
02:29:04,016 --> 02:29:05,188
I can't say
for how much longer,

3887
02:29:05,350 --> 02:29:07,227
but she will be
still be in prison

3888
02:29:07,386 --> 02:29:08,990
as long as I'm a cop.

3889
02:29:27,406 --> 02:29:30,876
[woman] Griselda Blanco, a,
I should say was 69-year-old

3890
02:29:31,042 --> 02:29:32,612
mother of four,
seen here in one of her

3891
02:29:32,777 --> 02:29:36,452
many, many mug shots
as of yesterday she is dead.

3892
02:29:36,614 --> 02:29:39,458
Gunned down
by a motorcycle riding assassin

3893
02:29:39,617 --> 02:29:41,255
as she stepped out
of a butcher shop

3894
02:29:41,419 --> 02:29:42,864
in Medellin, Colombia.

3895
02:29:43,021 --> 02:29:45,023
She might have been
behind as many as

3896
02:29:45,190 --> 02:29:48,467
200 executions
in Miami, in New York,

3897
02:29:48,626 --> 02:29:50,299
and in Irvine, California.

3898
02:29:50,462 --> 02:29:51,440
[Mooney]
She had so many enemies,

3899
02:29:51,596 --> 02:29:53,872
it's amazing she lasted
as long as she did.

3900
02:29:55,300 --> 02:29:56,779
[woman] This morning
Cocaine Cowboys hitman

3901
02:29:56,935 --> 02:29:58,539
Jorge Ayala
was back in court

3902
02:29:58,670 --> 02:30:00,775
hoping to get his
prison sentence reduced.

3903
02:30:00,939 --> 02:30:02,475
[man] The judge has denied us

3904
02:30:02,640 --> 02:30:04,415
the ability to have
a hearing on this issue

3905
02:30:04,576 --> 02:30:06,180
as to whether or not
the state attorneys office

3906
02:30:06,311 --> 02:30:09,383
has reneged on its agreement
to recommended parole

3907
02:30:09,514 --> 02:30:11,391
for Jorge
after 25 years in prison.

3908
02:30:11,516 --> 02:30:15,760
Commitments made to Mr. Ayala,
have not followed through.

3909
02:30:15,920 --> 02:30:17,661
I don't know
whether it's the notoriety,

3910
02:30:17,823 --> 02:30:20,303
the Cocaine Cowboys,
whatever it is,

3911
02:30:20,459 --> 02:30:23,133
they are putting on Jorge,
but he honored his agreement.

3912
02:30:23,295 --> 02:30:27,038
He put himself and his life
and his family's life at risk

3913
02:30:27,165 --> 02:30:28,940
by standing up
to the Colombian cartels

3914
02:30:29,100 --> 02:30:31,910
to testify against them
back in the '80s and '90s.

3915
02:30:32,070 --> 02:30:33,777
And now that
they're done with him,

3916
02:30:33,938 --> 02:30:36,509
and because supposedly
he made some phone calls

3917
02:30:36,675 --> 02:30:38,951
or had some
phone sex conversations

3918
02:30:39,110 --> 02:30:40,817
with some state
attorney secretaries.

3919
02:30:40,979 --> 02:30:42,424
Now they want
to throw him to the wolves

3920
02:30:42,547 --> 02:30:44,322
and let him die in prison,

3921
02:30:44,482 --> 02:30:45,460
because of some phone calls

3922
02:30:45,617 --> 02:30:46,960
that were made over
20 years ago.

3923
02:30:47,118 --> 02:30:48,461
You know, everybody
needs to get over that.

3924
02:30:48,620 --> 02:30:51,294
Jorge deserves to get
the benefit of the bargain.

3925
02:30:51,456 --> 02:30:53,436
He doesn't deserve
to die in prison.

3926
02:30:53,558 --> 02:30:55,629
He's atoned
for what he has done.
