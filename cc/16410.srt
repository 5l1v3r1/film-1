1
00:03:53,625 --> 00:03:55,542
Beg pardon.

2
00:04:06,333 --> 00:04:08,792
It's a good job your Masons' meeting's
only once a month.

3
00:04:08,917 --> 00:04:12,125
Oh. Tsk, tsk, tsk.

4
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:15,792
Aye, you're a proper old maid, Maggie,
if ever there was one.

5
00:04:28,457 --> 00:04:30,375
You're leather, Maggie.

6
00:04:30,457 --> 00:04:33,207
You're tough, ancient leather.
But I like leather.

7
00:04:33,332 --> 00:04:35,542
- Upstairs, Father.
- Wait a minute.

8
00:05:31,417 --> 00:05:33,375
Back in half an hour.

9
00:05:39,042 --> 00:05:41,292
I've got a business appointment,
my dear.

10
00:05:41,417 --> 00:05:43,292
I'll be back in half an hour.

11
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:55,167
Aye.

12
00:05:55,292 --> 00:05:57,250
- Aye.
- Aye.

13
00:06:00,167 --> 00:06:02,125
- Be over in a moment.
- Aye.

14
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:14,875
- Good morning, Maggie.

15
00:06:14,958 --> 00:06:18,125
- He's not down yet, Mr. Heeler.
- Hasn't he had breakfast?

16
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:20,625
Breakfast?
With your Masons' meeting last night?

17
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:23,957
- I'll be back.

18
00:06:24,042 --> 00:06:26,167
Oh, dear. I wish he'd hurry up.

19
00:06:26,292 --> 00:06:29,167
- Are you expecting anyone, Alice?
- Yes, I am. And you know I am.

20
00:06:29,292 --> 00:06:31,750
And I'll thank you both to go
when he comes.

21
00:06:31,832 --> 00:06:35,292
I'll sick of that Albert Prosser comin' here
to make sheep's eyes at Alice.

22
00:06:35,417 --> 00:06:37,500
If Father won't have us go courting,
what else can they do?

23
00:06:37,625 --> 00:06:39,500
If he wants to marry her,
why doesn't he do it?

24
00:06:39,625 --> 00:06:42,582
- Courting must come first.
- It needn't.

25
00:06:42,707 --> 00:06:46,500
Courting's like that, my lass -
all glitter and no use to nobody.

26
00:06:46,582 --> 00:06:48,582
- Yes, Father?

27
00:06:49,625 --> 00:06:53,125
- Clean handkerchief, Alice.
- In top drawer, Father.

28
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:57,292
- Oh! You've got this in a muddle.
- Keeping muddles straight is woman's business.

29
00:06:57,417 --> 00:06:59,292
I tidied this only last week.

30
00:06:59,417 --> 00:07:03,500
When your mother was alive,
things and people were kept in proper places.

31
00:07:03,625 --> 00:07:06,875
There. You won't be much longer, will you?
We've the room to do.

32
00:07:09,375 --> 00:07:11,958
You'll do this room
when I choose to leave it.

33
00:07:12,042 --> 00:07:14,000
Well, don't be much longer then.

34
00:07:17,707 --> 00:07:19,957
- Good morning, Miss Vicky.
- Good morning, Mr. Prosser.

35
00:07:20,042 --> 00:07:22,667
Miss Hobson.

36
00:07:22,792 --> 00:07:25,332
- Oh, good morning, Miss Alice.
- Father's not gone yet.

37
00:07:25,457 --> 00:07:27,207
Oh.

38
00:07:28,207 --> 00:07:30,500
And what can we do for you,
Mr. Prosser?

39
00:07:30,582 --> 00:07:33,125
I can't say I came to buy anything,
Miss Hobson.

40
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:36,707
This is a shop, you know? We're not here
to let people go without buying.

41
00:07:36,832 --> 00:07:38,875
Well, I'll just take a pair of bootlaces.

42
00:07:38,957 --> 00:07:43,750
- What size do you take in boots?
- Eight. I have small feet.

43
00:07:43,832 --> 00:07:46,750
- Does that matter to laces?
- It matters to boots.

44
00:07:46,832 --> 00:07:48,832
Sit down, Mr. Prosser.

45
00:07:51,082 --> 00:07:54,457
Tsk, tsk, tsk. These uppers
are a disgrace to the legal profession.

46
00:07:54,542 --> 00:07:56,457
Alice, number eights
from third rack, please.

47
00:07:56,542 --> 00:07:58,417
<i>-  Vicky!
- Oh, dear.</i>

48
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:01,333
- I'll be off.
- Sit easy, Mr. Prosser. You're a customer now.

49
00:08:05,833 --> 00:08:07,792
- You call that brushed?
- She's been at it, Father.

50
00:08:07,875 --> 00:08:09,792
At it to no purpose.

51
00:08:09,917 --> 00:08:12,708
- If my boots aren't what they should be -
- They are. I did them.

52
00:08:12,792 --> 00:08:14,708
Aye. We'll see.

53
00:08:15,875 --> 00:08:19,582
I suppose you know that you and Alice are
making yourselves the laughingstock of Salford.

54
00:08:19,707 --> 00:08:23,917
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- I'm bringing up the question of bustles.

55
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,917
- Bustles?
- Aye.

56
00:08:27,457 --> 00:08:29,332
Who had new dresses on last night?

57
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:34,167
I saw you out at Moonrakers parlor.

58
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:36,417
- And my friend Sam Minns -
- A publican.

59
00:08:36,542 --> 00:08:40,042
Aye, a publican and as honest a man
as ever stood behind a bar.

60
00:08:40,167 --> 00:08:45,000
My friend Sam Minns asked me
who you were, and well he might.

61
00:08:45,083 --> 00:08:48,750
You were going down Chapel Street
with a hump added to nature behind you.

62
00:08:48,875 --> 00:08:51,042
- Father!
- And you have the kind of waists...

63
00:08:51,167 --> 00:08:54,625
that's natural in wasps
but unnatural in women.

64
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:59,292
Aye, and you held your heads
like giraffes with a bad, stiff neck.

65
00:08:59,417 --> 00:09:02,500
And you were gone at the knees,
and the hump was waggin'.

66
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:06,958
- And I say it's immodest!
- It's not immodest, Father.
It's the fashion to wear bustles.

67
00:09:07,042 --> 00:09:09,125
- Then the hell with the fashion.
- Father!

68
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:11,208
You're not in Moonrakers now.

69
00:09:11,333 --> 00:09:14,583
- Comfortable?
- Yes. Very comfortable.

70
00:09:14,667 --> 00:09:17,333
Father's just on ready.

71
00:09:17,458 --> 00:09:19,750
- That'll be one pound, Mr. Prosser.
- A pound?

72
00:09:19,875 --> 00:09:22,208
Your money's not wasted.
Them boots'll last.

73
00:09:30,667 --> 00:09:32,875
<i>- Thank you.</i>

74
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,667
<i>You'd better have your old pair mended.
They'll be ready Wednesday.</i>

75
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:38,125
Oh, I don't think that -

76
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:41,667
- Thank you very much.
- Good morning.

77
00:09:41,792 --> 00:09:44,250
<i>- Good morning.</i>

78
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:46,583
Maggie, I've got
some business to attend to.

79
00:09:46,708 --> 00:09:49,375
I'll just be out
for about a quarter of an hour.

80
00:09:49,458 --> 00:09:52,250
- Don't be later for dinner, Father.
- It's a long way off, dinnertime.

81
00:09:52,333 --> 00:09:55,458
So that if you stay too long
in the Moonrakers, you'll be late for it.

82
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:58,625
Moonrakers? Who said anything -

83
00:09:58,708 --> 00:10:00,875
If your dinner's ruined,
it'll be your own fault.

84
00:10:02,917 --> 00:10:06,208
- Well, I'll be eternally-
- Don't swear in here, Father.

85
00:10:06,292 --> 00:10:10,042
No. I'll sit down instead.

86
00:10:10,125 --> 00:10:15,083
Now listen to me, you three.

87
00:10:15,208 --> 00:10:17,542
Providence has decreed
that you should lack a mother's hand...

88
00:10:17,625 --> 00:10:22,000
at the time when single girls grow bumptious
and must have somebody to rule.

89
00:10:22,083 --> 00:10:25,083
I'll tell you this.
You'll not rule me!

90
00:10:25,167 --> 00:10:27,417
You're not addressing
a Masons' meeting now, Father.

91
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:29,583
No. At the moment,
I'm addressing a few remarks...

92
00:10:29,708 --> 00:10:32,708
to the rebellious females
of this household.

93
00:10:32,833 --> 00:10:36,167
And what I say will be listened to
and heeded.

94
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:40,333
There's been a gradual increase
of uppishness towards me.

95
00:10:40,458 --> 00:10:42,667
- Morning, Miss Vicky.

96
00:10:45,792 --> 00:10:48,875
<i>Oh. Excuse me.
Some other time.</i>

97
00:10:50,958 --> 00:10:52,917
Yes, Father?

98
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,292
I've come to a decision about you two.

99
00:10:57,333 --> 00:11:00,542
You're going to exercise your gifts
on some other man than me.

100
00:11:00,667 --> 00:11:02,917
- You mean get married, Father?
- Exactly.

101
00:11:03,042 --> 00:11:05,792
I'm going to choose husbands
for the pair of you.

102
00:11:05,917 --> 00:11:08,375
You mean we can't choose husbands
for ourselves?

103
00:11:08,458 --> 00:11:11,083
You're not even fit
to choose dresses for yourselves.

104
00:11:11,167 --> 00:11:13,125
You're talking a lot
to Alice and Vicky, Father.

105
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:15,167
Where do I come in?

106
00:11:16,333 --> 00:11:18,042
- You?
- Aye.

107
00:11:18,167 --> 00:11:20,292
If you're dealing husbands round,
don't I get one?

108
00:11:20,375 --> 00:11:22,875
You with a husband?

109
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,875
Aye, that's a good one.

110
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,333
- Why not?
- Why not?

111
00:11:27,417 --> 00:11:29,375
Now, Maggie, I thought
you'd sense enough to know.

112
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:33,583
Well, if you want brutal truth,
you're past marrying age.

113
00:11:33,708 --> 00:11:36,583
- I'm 30.
- Aye. Thirty and shelved.

114
00:11:36,667 --> 00:11:40,042
Well, all the women
can't have husbands, Maggie.

115
00:11:40,125 --> 00:11:42,167
And I look to you
to take their mother's place...

116
00:11:42,292 --> 00:11:44,208
till I've made arrangements for them.

117
00:11:44,292 --> 00:11:48,167
- Dinner's at 1:00, remember.
- Dinner will be when I come in for it!

118
00:11:48,292 --> 00:11:50,917
- I am master here.

119
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,917
Oh, uh -

120
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,625
- Morning, Hobson.
- Morning, Mrs. Hepworth.

121
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:58,208
- It's a grand day.

122
00:12:01,792 --> 00:12:04,208
Now, I've come here
about these boots.

123
00:12:04,333 --> 00:12:08,708
Yes, Mrs. Hepworth.
Why, they look very nice.

124
00:12:08,792 --> 00:12:10,917
Get up, Hobson.
You look ridiculous on the floor.

125
00:12:12,125 --> 00:12:14,708
- Who made these boots?
- We did - our own make.

126
00:12:14,792 --> 00:12:17,250
Will you answer a straight question?
Who made these boots?

127
00:12:17,333 --> 00:12:19,375
- They were made on the premises.

128
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:21,417
Young woman, you seem to have
some sense when you serve me.

129
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:24,917
- Can you answer me?
- I think so, Mrs. Hepworth,
but I'll make sure for you.

130
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,833
- Tubby!

131
00:12:27,958 --> 00:12:31,167
- Did you wish to see
the identical workman, madam?
- I said so.

132
00:12:31,292 --> 00:12:34,000
But I'm responsible
for all work turned out here.

133
00:12:34,125 --> 00:12:37,375
- Yes, Miss Maggie?
- Man, did you make these boots?

134
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:39,583
- No, mum.
- Then who did?

135
00:12:39,667 --> 00:12:42,417
Am I to question every soul in the place
before I find out?

136
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:44,792
They're, uh -They're Willie's making,
those, mum.

137
00:12:44,875 --> 00:12:47,417
- Then tell Willie I want him.
- Certainly, mum.

138
00:12:47,542 --> 00:12:49,000
- Who's Willie?
- Willie.

139
00:12:49,083 --> 00:12:51,292
Name of Mossop.
But I assure you, if there's anything wrong...

140
00:12:51,375 --> 00:12:54,917
I'm capable of making the man
suffer for it.

141
00:12:55,042 --> 00:12:57,042
- You Mossop?
- Yes, mum.

142
00:12:57,167 --> 00:12:59,042
You made these boots?

143
00:13:01,083 --> 00:13:03,500
Aye. I made them last week.

144
00:13:03,625 --> 00:13:05,500
Take that.

145
00:13:07,833 --> 00:13:12,083
- Read it.
- I'm - I'm trying.

146
00:13:12,167 --> 00:13:14,083
<i>Bless the man.
Can't you read?</i>

147
00:13:14,167 --> 00:13:16,458
It's the italics which makes it
difficult for him, Mrs. Hepworth.

148
00:13:16,542 --> 00:13:20,417
Now listen to me, my man.
I'm particular about what I put on my feet.

149
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:22,708
I assure you
this will not occur again, Mrs. Hepworth.

150
00:13:22,833 --> 00:13:25,792
- What shan't?
- I don't know.

151
00:13:25,875 --> 00:13:27,792
Then hold your tongue.

152
00:13:27,875 --> 00:13:30,667
Now, Mossop,
I've tried every shop in Manchester...

153
00:13:30,792 --> 00:13:34,042
and these are the best-made
pair of boots I've ever had.

154
00:13:34,125 --> 00:13:37,417
Now, you make my boots in future.
You hear that, Hobson?

155
00:13:37,542 --> 00:13:39,542
Of course he shall.

156
00:13:41,333 --> 00:13:43,250
You keep that card, Mossop.

157
00:13:43,333 --> 00:13:46,875
Don't you dare to leave here and go to another
shop without letting me know where you are.

158
00:13:46,958 --> 00:13:50,500
- Oh, he won't make a change.
- How do you know?

159
00:13:50,625 --> 00:13:53,042
The man's a treasure,
and I expect you underpay him.

160
00:13:53,167 --> 00:13:57,042
- That'll do, Willie. You can go.
- Yes, sir.

161
00:13:57,167 --> 00:13:58,833
He's like a rabbit.

162
00:13:58,958 --> 00:14:01,083
Can I take your order
for another pair of boots, Mrs. Hepworth?

163
00:14:01,208 --> 00:14:03,125
No, not yet, young woman.

164
00:14:03,208 --> 00:14:06,292
But I shall send my daughters here,
and, mind, that man's to make the boots.

165
00:14:06,375 --> 00:14:08,292
- Certainly, Mrs. Hepworth.
- Good morning.

166
00:14:08,375 --> 00:14:11,500
Good morning, Mrs. Hepworth. Very glad
to have had the honor of serving you, madam.

167
00:14:11,625 --> 00:14:14,875
What does she want
to praise a workman to his face for?

168
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:19,000
- Happen he deserved it.
- Deserved be blowed. Making him uppish now.

169
00:14:19,125 --> 00:14:21,333
- You coming over, Henry?
- I am!

170
00:14:21,417 --> 00:14:24,708
- Dinner's at 1:00, remember.
- Now look here, Maggie.

171
00:14:24,833 --> 00:14:26,708
I set the hours in this house.

172
00:14:26,833 --> 00:14:30,542
It's 1:00 dinner because I say it is,
not because you do.

173
00:14:30,625 --> 00:14:34,625
- Yes, Father.
- So long as that's clear, I'll go.

174
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:39,292
Dinner's at half past.
That'll give him half an hour.

175
00:14:39,417 --> 00:14:44,708
Female perversity comes from
leading an indoor life.

176
00:14:44,833 --> 00:14:46,833
Morning.

177
00:14:46,958 --> 00:14:50,792
Women think they're important
because they're boss in kitchen.

178
00:14:52,125 --> 00:14:53,083
Hello.

179
00:14:58,667 --> 00:15:00,167
Oh. Uh -

180
00:15:10,917 --> 00:15:12,458
Runt.

181
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:16,542
How do you do?

182
00:15:16,625 --> 00:15:18,833
- Frederick.
- Yes, Father?

183
00:15:18,958 --> 00:15:21,583
- You see where Hobson's going?
- Yes, Father.

184
00:15:21,708 --> 00:15:24,375
There's a small spark of decency
in that man...

185
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:28,667
that's telling him, at this very moment,
that my eye's on him.

186
00:15:34,417 --> 00:15:37,292
- Morning, sir.
- Ah.

187
00:15:37,375 --> 00:15:39,333
Good morning, Mr. Hobson.

188
00:15:41,333 --> 00:15:43,208
Morning, Henry.

189
00:15:43,333 --> 00:15:45,958
- Morning, Henry.
- Up late this morning, Henry.

190
00:15:46,042 --> 00:15:48,042
I were detained.

191
00:15:50,208 --> 00:15:51,667
More.

192
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:55,792
You're doing a good class of trade, Henry.
Carriage folk now, eh?

193
00:15:58,458 --> 00:16:00,667
- Good health.
- I'd be in better health if it weren't for you.

194
00:16:00,792 --> 00:16:04,250
Do you think I pay you to dress
my daughters up like French poodles?

195
00:16:04,333 --> 00:16:06,833
You'll be £15 a year worse off for this.

196
00:16:06,917 --> 00:16:09,625
Now, Henry, this is not
the language of friends.

197
00:16:09,708 --> 00:16:12,292
And I hope we're all friends here.

198
00:16:12,375 --> 00:16:14,750
Aye.

199
00:16:14,875 --> 00:16:17,167
I own I'm a bit short today.

200
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:20,000
But I've cause to be and all.

201
00:16:20,125 --> 00:16:23,542
Sam, you've got daughters.

202
00:16:23,667 --> 00:16:25,750
Do yours worry you?

203
00:16:25,875 --> 00:16:27,792
Nay. They mostly do as I bid 'em...

204
00:16:27,875 --> 00:16:30,375
and missus does leatherin'
if they don't.

205
00:16:30,458 --> 00:16:32,375
Aye.

206
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:35,083
A wife's a handy thing.

207
00:16:35,208 --> 00:16:39,542
- And I wish mine were still alive.

208
00:16:39,625 --> 00:16:43,458
I do. I know what you're thinking.
But I do.

209
00:16:43,583 --> 00:16:46,583
I felt grateful
when my Mary fell on rest...

210
00:16:46,708 --> 00:16:49,667
but I can see now
that I made a mistake.

211
00:16:52,083 --> 00:16:55,542
The dominion of one woman
is paradise...

212
00:16:55,667 --> 00:16:58,458
to the dominion of three.

213
00:16:58,542 --> 00:17:00,875
You want to get 'em wed, Henry.

214
00:17:00,958 --> 00:17:05,000
Aye. I've thought of that,
but the trouble is to find men.

215
00:17:05,125 --> 00:17:07,125
Men are common enough.

216
00:17:08,208 --> 00:17:11,875
I'd like my daughters to wed
temperance young men, Denton.

217
00:17:11,958 --> 00:17:13,875
Good heavens.

218
00:17:13,958 --> 00:17:16,916
You must keep your demands
within reasonable limits, Henry.

219
00:17:17,041 --> 00:17:19,416
You've got three daughters
to provide husbands for.

220
00:17:19,541 --> 00:17:21,416
- Two, Jim. Two.
- Two?

221
00:17:21,541 --> 00:17:23,583
Maggie's too useful to part with.

222
00:17:23,708 --> 00:17:25,625
Aye.

223
00:17:25,708 --> 00:17:28,750
And she's a bit on ripe side
for marrying is our Maggie.

224
00:17:33,417 --> 00:17:36,458
Ripe? I've know 'em do it
when they're twice her age.

225
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:41,042
Still, leaving Maggie out,
you've still got two.

226
00:17:41,167 --> 00:17:43,042
One'll do to start with.

227
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:45,667
I've noticed that if you get
one marriage in a family...

228
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:48,375
it goes through the lot like measles.

229
00:17:51,167 --> 00:17:54,958
Well, now we're getting down to business.
We know what we want.

230
00:17:55,083 --> 00:17:59,000
We want one young man,
and we want him temperance.

231
00:17:59,083 --> 00:18:02,542
Question is, Henry,
how high are you prepared to go?

232
00:18:02,625 --> 00:18:06,833
Oh, aye. I'll put me hand down
for the wedding do all right.

233
00:18:06,958 --> 00:18:10,375
Ah. A warm man like you
will have to do more...

234
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:12,792
than pay for wedding do, Henry.

235
00:18:12,917 --> 00:18:15,083
What's price of an outfit, Tudsbury?

236
00:18:15,167 --> 00:18:18,292
Oh, I could do a milady's trousseau
for, uh, £60.

237
00:18:18,375 --> 00:18:22,875
<i>Hmm. And then there'll be, uh,
settlements.</i>

238
00:18:24,917 --> 00:18:28,917
- Settlements?
- Marriage settlements, Henry.

239
00:18:29,042 --> 00:18:31,375
Me pay marriage settlements?

240
00:18:31,458 --> 00:18:33,750
500 apiece for temperance folk.

241
00:18:33,833 --> 00:18:37,000
- 500?

242
00:18:37,083 --> 00:18:39,792
<i>You have to bait your hook
to catch fish, Henry.</i>

243
00:18:39,917 --> 00:18:41,792
Then I'll none go fishing.

244
00:18:41,917 --> 00:18:45,167
They can stay single and lump it.
Settlements indeed!

245
00:18:45,292 --> 00:18:47,417
You'll save the keep.

246
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:49,458
They work for that,
and they're none of them big eaters.

247
00:18:49,583 --> 00:18:51,458
- And their wages.
- Wages?

248
00:18:51,583 --> 00:18:56,042
Do you think I pay my own daughters wages?
I'm not a fool.

249
00:18:56,167 --> 00:18:58,042
Then it's all off?

250
00:18:59,083 --> 00:19:04,042
From the moment you breathed the word
"settlements,"Jim, it were dead off.

251
00:19:05,708 --> 00:19:08,333
There'll be no marriages in my house.

252
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:17,250
- Father.
- Aye.

253
00:19:17,333 --> 00:19:20,833
No self-respecting decent man
will marry us without settlements.

254
00:19:20,917 --> 00:19:22,875
It's expected from a man like you.

255
00:19:22,958 --> 00:19:25,875
Is it? Then I'll thwart their expectations.

256
00:19:25,958 --> 00:19:29,083
- Father.
- Get back into shop, lot of you!

257
00:19:34,625 --> 00:19:37,125
Oh, they'll soon get over it, Maggie.

258
00:19:38,833 --> 00:19:40,542
Aye.

259
00:19:41,583 --> 00:19:45,250
I'm making plans,
and a husband's included in them.

260
00:19:45,375 --> 00:19:46,833
What?

261
00:19:46,917 --> 00:19:49,250
One, two, three Sundays
for calling the banns.

262
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:52,625
Anytime after that,
when we get a fine day, I shall be wed.

263
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:55,083
- You?
- Me, Father.

264
00:19:55,208 --> 00:19:57,458
I'll tell you something, Maggie,
that's maybe news to you.

265
00:19:57,583 --> 00:20:00,750
If you're counting on a settlement from me,
you're on wrong horse, my lass.

266
00:20:00,875 --> 00:20:02,875
Nay, I'm not.
I want no settlement.

267
00:20:02,958 --> 00:20:05,208
I should think not neither.

268
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,333
- What's his name?
- His name?

269
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:11,417
I'll tell you when I've got him.

270
00:20:12,958 --> 00:20:16,792
Thou art countin' chickens
before they're hatched.

271
00:20:16,917 --> 00:20:21,625
Maggie. You nearly frightened me.

272
00:20:21,708 --> 00:20:26,333
I never knew an old maid yet that hadn't
a husband coming along in a month.

273
00:20:26,458 --> 00:20:29,500
I'll admit you gave me a shock
when you broke news...

274
00:20:29,625 --> 00:20:32,375
but I'd no cause to fret meself.

275
00:20:32,458 --> 00:20:34,375
I don't mind you having
these fancies, Maggie.

276
00:20:34,458 --> 00:20:39,000
Fancies are valuable for keeping
females quiet and content.

277
00:20:39,083 --> 00:20:41,500
Now get back in shop.

278
00:20:41,625 --> 00:20:43,542
Aye.

279
00:20:43,625 --> 00:20:46,500
It's a great relief to know that your mind's
taken up with ideas.

280
00:20:46,625 --> 00:20:49,583
I thought at first
it was taken up with a real man.

281
00:21:00,042 --> 00:21:03,250
- Good night, Maggie.
- Good night, Father.

282
00:21:05,333 --> 00:21:08,208
- Hey, lass.

283
00:21:08,333 --> 00:21:11,292
Hey.

284
00:21:31,125 --> 00:21:33,542
- Willie.
- Yes, Miss Maggie?

285
00:21:33,667 --> 00:21:36,167
- Come up.
- I haven't finished yet, Miss Maggie.

286
00:21:36,292 --> 00:21:38,167
Come up.

287
00:21:51,375 --> 00:21:53,292
Come with me.

288
00:22:04,792 --> 00:22:06,792
Shut the door.

289
00:22:11,417 --> 00:22:13,292
Come here.

290
00:22:19,083 --> 00:22:21,458
Show me your hands, Willie.

291
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:23,417
They're dirty.

292
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,250
Aye, they're dirty,
but they're clever.

293
00:22:28,542 --> 00:22:32,042
They can shape the leather like no other
man's that's ever come into the shop.

294
00:22:33,167 --> 00:22:37,250
- Who taught you, Willie?
- Why, Miss Maggie, I learnt me trade here.

295
00:22:37,375 --> 00:22:40,833
Hobson's never taught you to make boots
the way you do.

296
00:22:40,958 --> 00:22:44,708
- I've had no other teacher.
- And needed none.

297
00:22:44,792 --> 00:22:47,833
- When are you going to leave Hobson's?
- Leave Hobson's?

298
00:22:47,917 --> 00:22:50,750
I - I thought I gave satisfaction.

299
00:22:50,833 --> 00:22:53,292
- Don't you want to leave?
- Not me.

300
00:22:53,417 --> 00:22:55,375
I've been at Hobson's all me life.

301
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:59,417
- I'm not leaving till I'm made to.
- Don't you want to get on, Will Mossop?

302
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:02,708
You know the wages you could get
in one of the big shops in Manchester?

303
00:23:02,833 --> 00:23:06,667
I'd be feared
to go in one of them fine places.

304
00:23:06,708 --> 00:23:09,000
What keeps you here?

305
00:23:09,125 --> 00:23:12,958
I don't know.
L-I'm used to being here.

306
00:23:14,042 --> 00:23:16,625
Do you know what keeps
this business on its legs?

307
00:23:16,708 --> 00:23:20,792
Two things. One's the good boots
you make that sell themselves.

308
00:23:20,875 --> 00:23:24,000
The other's the bad boots
other people make and I sell.

309
00:23:24,083 --> 00:23:26,167
We are a pair, Will Mossop.

310
00:23:26,250 --> 00:23:28,292
You're a wonder in the shop,
Miss Maggie.

311
00:23:28,417 --> 00:23:32,042
You're a marvel in the workshop.
Well?

312
00:23:33,667 --> 00:23:35,583
Well, what?

313
00:23:35,667 --> 00:23:40,458
- It seems to me to point one way.
- What way is that?

314
00:23:42,125 --> 00:23:44,125
You're leaving me
to do all the work, my lad.

315
00:23:46,208 --> 00:23:49,125
Aye. I think I'll be getting back
to me stool, Miss Maggie.

316
00:23:49,208 --> 00:23:51,208
You'll go when I've done with you.

317
00:23:52,292 --> 00:23:54,792
I've been watching you
for a long time...

318
00:23:54,917 --> 00:23:57,167
and everything I've seen I've liked.

319
00:23:57,292 --> 00:24:02,292
- I think you'll do for me.
- What way, Miss Maggie?

320
00:24:02,375 --> 00:24:05,583
Will Mossop, you're my man.

321
00:24:07,542 --> 00:24:10,000
- But I never-
- I know you never.

322
00:24:10,083 --> 00:24:12,708
Or it wouldn't be left for me
to do a job like this.

323
00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:15,958
I'll -

324
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,958
I'll sit down.

325
00:24:19,083 --> 00:24:23,125
I'm - I'm feeling queer like.

326
00:24:23,250 --> 00:24:26,125
What -What dost want me for?

327
00:24:26,208 --> 00:24:29,875
To invest in. You're a business idea
in the shape of a man.

328
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,667
- But I have no head for business at all.
- But I have.

329
00:24:32,792 --> 00:24:36,000
My brain and your hands
will make a working partnership.

330
00:24:37,083 --> 00:24:40,000
Partnership. Hey.

331
00:24:40,125 --> 00:24:42,125
Hey, that's different.

332
00:24:42,208 --> 00:24:44,958
- I thought you were asking me to wed you.
- I am.

333
00:24:47,333 --> 00:24:50,042
Well, by gum.

334
00:24:51,375 --> 00:24:53,250
And you the master's daughter.

335
00:24:53,375 --> 00:24:56,750
I'll tell you something, Willie.
It's a poor sort of woman that will stay lazy...

336
00:24:56,833 --> 00:24:58,917
when she sees her best chance
slipping from her.

337
00:25:00,292 --> 00:25:03,708
- I'm your best chance?
- You are that, Will.

338
00:25:04,792 --> 00:25:07,583
Well, by gum.

339
00:25:07,667 --> 00:25:10,833
- I never thought of this.
- Think of it now.

340
00:25:10,958 --> 00:25:12,875
I am doing.

341
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:16,167
Only blow's a bit too sudden
to think very clear.

342
00:25:16,250 --> 00:25:18,542
You're going to wed me, Will.

343
00:25:19,708 --> 00:25:21,833
Nay.

344
00:25:21,917 --> 00:25:24,958
Really. I -
I can't do that, Miss Maggie.

345
00:25:25,042 --> 00:25:28,750
I - I can see I'm disturbing
your arrangements like...

346
00:25:28,875 --> 00:25:32,625
but I'll be glad
if you'll put this notion from you.

347
00:25:32,750 --> 00:25:35,708
When I make arrangements, my lad,
they're not for upsetting.

348
00:25:35,833 --> 00:25:38,458
You're walking out with me -
Peel Park, Sunday.

349
00:25:39,750 --> 00:25:42,000
Peel Park?

350
00:25:42,125 --> 00:25:44,792
- But folks'll think-
- Thinking won't hurt them.

351
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:48,875
You can go home now, Willie.

352
00:26:22,750 --> 00:26:24,625
I've come.

353
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:26,625
I told you to come.

354
00:26:32,917 --> 00:26:35,417
Who's that?

355
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:38,417
- William Mossop.
- Who's William Mossop?

356
00:26:39,625 --> 00:26:41,542
Our boot hand.

357
00:27:04,667 --> 00:27:08,250
You're a natural-born genius
at making boots.

358
00:27:08,333 --> 00:27:11,167
It's a pity you're a natural fool
at all else.

359
00:27:11,292 --> 00:27:14,083
I'm not much use at owt but leather,
and that's a fact.

360
00:27:20,750 --> 00:27:24,750
I saw river clean once -
Sunday school outing up on the moors.

361
00:27:24,875 --> 00:27:29,167
Will, we'll have the first banns call
next Sunday.

362
00:27:29,250 --> 00:27:33,375
Nay. I've a great respect for you,
Miss Maggie.

363
00:27:33,458 --> 00:27:38,000
But when it comes to marrying, I'm bound
to tell you I'm none in love with you.

364
00:27:38,125 --> 00:27:40,375
I've got the love, all right.

365
00:27:40,458 --> 00:27:42,583
Well, I've not, and that's honest.

366
00:27:42,708 --> 00:27:44,583
We'll get along without it.

367
00:27:46,083 --> 00:27:48,250
But... what will master say?

368
00:27:48,375 --> 00:27:52,417
He'll say a lot, but he can say it.
Makes no difference to me.

369
00:27:52,542 --> 00:27:54,458
Much better not upset him.

370
00:27:54,542 --> 00:27:57,750
- I'm the judge of that.
- Oh.

371
00:27:57,833 --> 00:28:03,000
But what makes it so desperate awkward
is there's another woman.

372
00:28:04,042 --> 00:28:07,333
- There's what?
- I'm tokened to Ada Figgins.

373
00:28:07,417 --> 00:28:10,333
Then you'll get loose, and quick.

374
00:28:10,417 --> 00:28:12,542
Who's Ada Figgins?

375
00:28:12,667 --> 00:28:15,042
I'm the lodger at her mother's.

376
00:28:15,125 --> 00:28:17,708
Not that sandy-haired girl
that brings you dinner?

377
00:28:17,833 --> 00:28:20,458
She's golden-haired is Ada.

378
00:28:21,625 --> 00:28:25,042
- Where is it?
- You-You'll not go there?

379
00:28:25,167 --> 00:28:27,667
Won't I?
I'll soon clean this up.

380
00:28:30,917 --> 00:28:34,417
L-I'd really rather wed Ada, Maggie,
if it's all the same to you.

381
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:39,667
She-She's a terrible rough side
to her tongue has Mrs. Figgins.

382
00:28:50,667 --> 00:28:52,542
Miss Hobson's coming!

383
00:28:52,667 --> 00:28:54,583
Miss Hobson?

384
00:29:01,292 --> 00:29:04,208
- That-That's Mrs. Figgins, Miss Maggie.
- I know.

385
00:29:04,292 --> 00:29:07,250
- You know Ada.
- Aye, I do.

386
00:29:07,333 --> 00:29:10,083
- I want a word with you, young woman.
- Yes, Miss Hobson?

387
00:29:10,125 --> 00:29:12,292
- What's all this with you and him?
- Ada, I was trying to -

388
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:15,958
You hold your hush.
This is for me and her to settle.

389
00:29:16,083 --> 00:29:19,458
- Young woman, you're treading on my foot.
- Me, Miss Hobson?

390
00:29:19,542 --> 00:29:22,208
They're tokened, him and her.
We're all very happy about it.

391
00:29:22,333 --> 00:29:24,292
Aye, he looks happy.

392
00:29:24,417 --> 00:29:27,500
<i>Take a look at him, Ada.
Take a good look.</i>

393
00:29:29,292 --> 00:29:31,833
Not much for two women
to fall out over, is there?

394
00:29:31,958 --> 00:29:34,208
Maybe he's not much to look at,
Miss Hobson.

395
00:29:34,333 --> 00:29:37,167
- But he's the man she's going to marry.
- That's right.

396
00:29:37,250 --> 00:29:39,208
That's funny.
I can say it same.

397
00:29:39,292 --> 00:29:41,583
- You?
- You, Miss Hobson?

398
00:29:41,667 --> 00:29:43,583
That's what I've been
trying to tell you, Ada.

399
00:29:43,667 --> 00:29:47,417
- By gum, she'll have me from you
if you don't be careful.
- Willie, you wait outside.

400
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:49,583
By look of things,
you'll come back to a thick ear.

401
00:29:49,708 --> 00:29:51,917
- Don't lose your temper, Mrs. Figgins.
- Lose my temper?

402
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,667
I'll do more than lose my temper
when I get my hands on him!

403
00:30:24,625 --> 00:30:28,042
<i>-  You've cornered him, the pair of you!
-  Cornered him?</i>

404
00:30:28,125 --> 00:30:29,917
<i>Insulting me, insulting my daughter.
He'll wed Ada.</i>

405
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:33,958
<i>-  What's your idea of his future?
-  I'll tell you his future.</i>

406
00:30:34,083 --> 00:30:36,000
<i>He'll wed our Ada,
and he'll work for her and me.</i>

407
00:30:36,083 --> 00:30:39,500
<i> And remain an 18-shilling-a-week
boot hand for the rest of his life.</i>

408
00:30:39,583 --> 00:30:41,458
<i>-  And what's wrong with that?
- I'll tell you.</i>

409
00:30:41,542 --> 00:30:44,458
<i> And what do you think
you're going to do with him, my fine lady?</i>

410
00:30:44,583 --> 00:30:48,125
<i> Will Mossop is a good man,
as meek and fine as I'm strong and hard.</i>

411
00:30:48,167 --> 00:30:50,167
<i>-  Fine? I don't know.
-  Aye! Fine.</i>

412
00:30:50,250 --> 00:30:54,167
<i>And he can shape and fashion leather
like no other man in Lancashire.</i>

413
00:30:54,250 --> 00:30:56,958
<i>A man who can do that
can go right on to the top.</i>

414
00:30:57,042 --> 00:31:00,333
<i>And what he lacks in business brains
and sense, I'll supply him with.</i>

415
00:31:00,417 --> 00:31:03,000
<i>I love that man,
and I'm going to work for him.</i>

416
00:31:06,292 --> 00:31:08,375
Take that!
Got a nose for the brass, have ya?

417
00:31:08,458 --> 00:31:11,042
I'll learn you to carry on with that hussy
under the nose of my Ada!

418
00:31:11,167 --> 00:31:13,083
Here! What are you doing?

419
00:31:13,167 --> 00:31:16,750
If you as much as lay one finger on either
of us, I'll have the law on you for assault.

420
00:31:16,833 --> 00:31:19,000
- Come on, Willie.
- Have the law on me, she says.

421
00:31:19,125 --> 00:31:21,000
It's me as'll have the law on you,
my fine lady.

422
00:31:21,125 --> 00:31:23,958
<i>-  It's daylight robbery!
- Common thief!</i>

423
00:31:24,042 --> 00:31:25,667
My girl's been betrayed!

424
00:31:25,792 --> 00:31:29,708
Look at him!
Slinking away with his fancy bit!

425
00:31:29,792 --> 00:31:32,792
Bringing that dirty creeping dodger here...

426
00:31:32,917 --> 00:31:36,292
as though she were something
we should kiss the yard pavement for!

427
00:31:36,375 --> 00:31:39,167
<i> You just wait till that stunner
comes back here tonight!</i>

428
00:31:42,875 --> 00:31:45,542
- Where are we going now?
- We're going round to Tubby's.

429
00:31:45,667 --> 00:31:48,458
You're going to stay with him
from now on.

430
00:31:48,583 --> 00:31:52,583
You mean I'm - I'm not to go back there?
Never no more?

431
00:31:52,708 --> 00:31:55,042
You're never
going back there again, Will.

432
00:31:58,375 --> 00:32:00,292
It's like a happy dream.

433
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:07,500
Now you can kiss me, Will.

434
00:32:09,458 --> 00:32:13,833
Well, I -That's forcing things a bit
and all, Miss Maggie.

435
00:32:13,958 --> 00:32:16,417
We won't get a proper chance
back there at Tubby's.

436
00:32:18,417 --> 00:32:22,333
But right - right here in street?

437
00:32:23,458 --> 00:32:26,083
Come on, lad. Get it over.

438
00:32:30,958 --> 00:32:35,792
But - But it's like saying I agree
to everything, a kiss is.

439
00:32:45,542 --> 00:32:47,458
Nay, I couldn't.

440
00:32:59,750 --> 00:33:02,292
- Where's Maggie?
- Just come in.

441
00:33:02,417 --> 00:33:05,333
- She is late.
- Yes, she is.

442
00:33:05,417 --> 00:33:07,375
- Ah.
-  Tea ready?

443
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:09,458
It's not boiled yet.

444
00:33:12,583 --> 00:33:14,875
What's this with you and Willie?

445
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:18,333
I'm going to marry him.
Pass the tea, Alice.

446
00:33:18,417 --> 00:33:21,875
- You're going to marry Will Mossop?
- You must've taken leave of your senses.

447
00:33:21,958 --> 00:33:24,667
- Is there supposed to be some disgrace in him?
- You ask Father if there's disgrace.

448
00:33:24,792 --> 00:33:27,458
Now, look here, Maggie. Things are bad enough
without you spoiling our chances.

449
00:33:27,542 --> 00:33:29,917
I'll not do that.
Father said get wed, and you will.

450
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,542
Do you think Albert will wed me
with Mossop for brother-in-law?

451
00:33:32,667 --> 00:33:34,708
If Albert's got any sense,
he'd be proud to.

452
00:33:34,833 --> 00:33:36,708
What you do touches us. It -

453
00:33:36,833 --> 00:33:39,333
What's this?

454
00:33:39,417 --> 00:33:44,458
- You'll have your tea in a minute, Father-
if they have nothing to say.
- We've a lot to say.

455
00:33:44,542 --> 00:33:47,125
You always have.
You're a pair of chattering magpies.

456
00:33:47,208 --> 00:33:50,250
Maggie's got more sense in her little finger
than the two of you put together.

457
00:33:50,375 --> 00:33:53,917
Don't lose your temper with them, Father.
Happen you'll need it when Vicky speaks.

458
00:33:54,042 --> 00:33:56,250
What's Vicky been up to now?

459
00:33:56,375 --> 00:33:59,417
<i>I've done nothing, Father.
It's about Will Mossop.</i>

460
00:33:59,542 --> 00:34:02,625
- Will?
- Yes. What's your opinion of Will, Father?

461
00:34:02,750 --> 00:34:06,875
He's a decent enough lad.
I have nowt against him that I know of.

462
00:34:06,958 --> 00:34:09,083
- Would you like him in the family?
- Whose family?

463
00:34:09,208 --> 00:34:11,667
- Yours.
- I'm going to marry Will, Father.

464
00:34:11,792 --> 00:34:13,667
- That's what all the fuss is about.
- Marry?

465
00:34:13,792 --> 00:34:15,917
You? Mossop?

466
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:19,583
You thought me past the marrying age.
I'm not. That's all.

467
00:34:19,708 --> 00:34:21,833
Will Mossop? Me boot hand?

468
00:34:21,958 --> 00:34:24,042
Have you lost your senses, girl?

469
00:34:24,167 --> 00:34:26,083
It's news to me
we're snobs in Salford.

470
00:34:26,208 --> 00:34:29,333
His father was a workhouse brat...

471
00:34:29,417 --> 00:34:31,333
a come-by-chance.

472
00:34:31,417 --> 00:34:34,667
I'm having Willie Mossop.
I've to settle my life's course.

473
00:34:34,750 --> 00:34:36,667
And a good course too.
So think on.

474
00:34:36,750 --> 00:34:39,125
I won't have it, Maggie!

475
00:34:39,250 --> 00:34:41,500
I - I - I -

476
00:34:41,583 --> 00:34:44,042
I'd be the laughingstock
of the place if I -

477
00:34:46,333 --> 00:34:48,542
Outside, you two.

478
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:53,500
<i>Now, do you hear, Maggie?
I won't have it.</i>

479
00:34:53,625 --> 00:34:57,625
Why it - it isn't decent,
at your time of life.

480
00:34:57,708 --> 00:35:01,750
I'm 30, and I'm going to marry
Willie Mossop.

481
00:35:01,875 --> 00:35:04,417
- And now I'll tell you my terms.
- Terms?

482
00:35:04,542 --> 00:35:07,667
You'll pay my man, Will Mossop,
the same wages as before.

483
00:35:07,750 --> 00:35:12,375
<i>As for me, I've given you the better part
of 20 years' work without wages.</i>

484
00:35:12,458 --> 00:35:16,292
I'll work eight hours a day in future,
and you'll pay me 15 shillings for the week.

485
00:35:16,417 --> 00:35:18,292
Do you think I'm made of brass?

486
00:35:18,417 --> 00:35:20,875
You'll soon be made of less than you are
if you let Willie go.

487
00:35:20,958 --> 00:35:24,000
And if Willie goes, I go.
That's what you've got to face.

488
00:35:24,083 --> 00:35:26,000
I might face that, Maggie.

489
00:35:26,125 --> 00:35:29,000
- Shop hands are cheap.
- Cheap ones are cheap.

490
00:35:29,125 --> 00:35:31,792
I'm value to you.
So's my man.

491
00:35:31,917 --> 00:35:34,375
And you can boast it in the Moonrakers
that your daughter Maggie's...

492
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:38,792
made the strangest, finest match
a woman's made this 50 year.

493
00:35:38,875 --> 00:35:41,500
Now you can put your hand in your pocket
and do what I propose.

494
00:35:41,625 --> 00:35:43,833
Propose?

495
00:35:43,958 --> 00:35:47,875
I'll tell you what I propose.

496
00:36:37,458 --> 00:36:40,667
- Will Mossop!
- Yes, Mr. Hobson?

497
00:36:40,792 --> 00:36:43,583
<i>- Come up!
- Yes, Mr. Hobson.</i>

498
00:37:02,583 --> 00:37:05,875
You've taken up
with our Maggie, I hear.

499
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,875
Nay, I've not.
She's done taking up.

500
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,042
Well, either way, Willie,
you've fallen on misfortune.

501
00:37:11,167 --> 00:37:14,583
Love's led you astray,
and I feel bound to put you right.

502
00:37:17,833 --> 00:37:19,750
I'm watching you, my lad.

503
00:37:20,750 --> 00:37:24,250
Now mind, Willie, you can keep your job.
I don't bear malice.

504
00:37:24,375 --> 00:37:28,125
But you've got an ailment,
and I've got the cure.

505
00:37:28,250 --> 00:37:30,875
We'll beat the love from your body.

506
00:37:30,958 --> 00:37:35,042
And every morning you come here to work
with love still sittin' in you, you'll get a leathering.

507
00:37:35,125 --> 00:37:37,333
You'll not beat love in me.

508
00:37:37,458 --> 00:37:39,333
You're making a great mistake,
Mr. Hobson.

509
00:37:39,458 --> 00:37:44,500
You'll put aside your weakness for my Maggie
if you've a liking for a sound skin.

510
00:37:44,625 --> 00:37:49,083
I was none wanting thy Maggie.
It was her that was after me.

511
00:37:49,208 --> 00:37:51,083
But I tell you this, Mr. Hobson.

512
00:37:51,208 --> 00:37:55,958
If you touch me with that belt,
I'll take her quick and stick to her like glue.

513
00:37:56,083 --> 00:37:58,833
There's no but one answer
to that kind of talk, my lad.

514
00:38:00,417 --> 00:38:02,333
And I have no
but one answer back.

515
00:38:02,417 --> 00:38:05,042
Maggie, I've none kissed you yet.
I shirked before.

516
00:38:05,125 --> 00:38:07,042
But by gum, I'll kiss you now.

517
00:38:09,292 --> 00:38:12,292
And if Mr. Hobson raises up
that belt again, I'll do more.

518
00:38:12,417 --> 00:38:14,958
I'll walk straight out of shop with thee,
and us two will set up by ourselves.

519
00:38:15,083 --> 00:38:16,958
I knew you had it in you.

520
00:38:18,958 --> 00:38:20,833
Come on, lass.

521
00:38:25,667 --> 00:38:27,583
Oh, Willie.

522
00:38:51,125 --> 00:38:53,958
- I've - I've got to go back.
- What for?

523
00:38:54,042 --> 00:38:56,625
I must apologize to Mr. Hobson.

524
00:38:56,708 --> 00:39:00,042
I don't know what came over me
to front the master as I did.

525
00:39:00,167 --> 00:39:02,208
<i>I came over you.</i>

526
00:39:02,333 --> 00:39:04,417
Look sharp now.
We've got to catch yonder tram.

527
00:39:06,167 --> 00:39:08,625
Give me that card
Mrs. Hepworth gave you.

528
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,875
What dost want it for?

529
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:15,333
Well, if we're going to set up on our own,
we shall want capital.

530
00:39:15,417 --> 00:39:17,625
Capital? What's capital?

531
00:39:34,292 --> 00:39:36,208
Good morning, Miss Hobson.
You're out early.

532
00:39:36,292 --> 00:39:38,292
- Good morning, Mrs. Hepworth.
- Morning, mum.

533
00:39:38,375 --> 00:39:40,917
Why, you're the man
who made the boots.

534
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,917
Come and sit down.

535
00:39:47,875 --> 00:39:49,917
Now, what is it you want?

536
00:39:50,042 --> 00:39:53,125
You said he wasn't to make a change
without letting you know.

537
00:39:53,250 --> 00:39:56,667
Well, he's making a change.
He's asked me to marry him.

538
00:39:56,792 --> 00:39:58,792
I congratulate you
on your choice, Mossop...

539
00:39:58,875 --> 00:40:00,875
but I referred to a change
in your employment.

540
00:40:00,958 --> 00:40:04,042
Yes, he's changing that and all.
That's what he's come about.

541
00:40:04,167 --> 00:40:07,958
He's setting up on his own and needs
a hundred pounds to start him off.

542
00:40:08,042 --> 00:40:10,583
<i>- £100?
- Does he? </i>

543
00:40:10,708 --> 00:40:13,458
Well, he won't miss anything
for fear of speaking out.

544
00:40:13,583 --> 00:40:17,000
He's the gift of making boots,
and I've the gift of selling them.

545
00:40:17,125 --> 00:40:19,167
There's brass in boots, Mrs. Hepworth.

546
00:40:19,292 --> 00:40:23,625
And we could pay you your money back
plus 20% in a year from now.

547
00:40:23,708 --> 00:40:25,625
What security can you give me?

548
00:40:25,708 --> 00:40:28,250
Him. He's the security.

549
00:40:28,333 --> 00:40:30,875
<i>He's the best boot maker
in Lancashire.</i>

550
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,917
<i>And the more you tell your friends
about him, the more secure you'll be.</i>

551
00:40:37,417 --> 00:40:39,833
<i>£100.</i>

552
00:40:39,958 --> 00:40:42,667
Thou means to say yon bit of paper
she gave you means all that?

553
00:40:42,750 --> 00:40:44,667
- It does.

554
00:40:44,750 --> 00:40:46,833
Now we've got to get a move on.
We've a lot to do this morning.

555
00:40:46,958 --> 00:40:49,167
We've a shop to find, some bits
of furniture to pick up cheap...

556
00:40:49,250 --> 00:40:51,708
the banns to see about
and some leather and tools to buy.

557
00:40:51,792 --> 00:40:53,750
I reckon we'll start with the shop.

558
00:41:10,750 --> 00:41:14,292
- What do you want the place for?
- A boot shop.

559
00:41:14,375 --> 00:41:16,625
- And a living room.
- Oh.

560
00:41:27,042 --> 00:41:29,667
<i>- What's the rent?
- Ten shillings a week.</i>

561
00:41:29,750 --> 00:41:31,667
We shall be needing some bed linen.

562
00:41:31,750 --> 00:41:34,375
I'll buy it from you -
if we come to terms.

563
00:41:34,458 --> 00:41:39,083
- I'll give you five shillings a week.
- Well, I might take seven and sixpence.

564
00:41:39,208 --> 00:41:42,375
There's two pounds
for eight weeks rent in advance.

565
00:41:42,458 --> 00:41:44,583
Is it a bargain?

566
00:41:44,708 --> 00:41:48,000
It is. I'll try and move all this stuff
out of your way tomorrow.

567
00:41:48,125 --> 00:41:50,125
This shop's opening
at 6:00 in the morning.

568
00:41:50,250 --> 00:41:52,167
Will, take your coat off.
I'm going out.

569
00:41:52,250 --> 00:41:55,542
And if this place isn't clear by the time
I'm back, you'll meet with trouble.

570
00:42:50,042 --> 00:42:53,167
- Set up on their own. Set up on their own.

571
00:42:53,292 --> 00:42:55,708
So I said to them -
no temper, mind you -

572
00:42:55,792 --> 00:42:57,875
I said,
"If you can't come to your senses...

573
00:42:57,958 --> 00:43:00,875
and behave in a responsible
manner, out you go."

574
00:43:00,958 --> 00:43:03,250
And out they went.

575
00:43:03,333 --> 00:43:05,250
Do you know what happened then?

576
00:43:05,333 --> 00:43:09,083
The great lover goes past me so fast
to keep clear of the business end of me boot...

577
00:43:09,167 --> 00:43:11,667
that he goes ass over tip on pavement.

578
00:43:16,250 --> 00:43:19,958
Aye. Same again all around, Sam.

579
00:43:23,042 --> 00:43:25,833
It's his daughter.

580
00:43:25,917 --> 00:43:27,833
I know.

581
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:32,958
I'll give that loving pair three months...

582
00:43:33,083 --> 00:43:34,917
and they'll be back
begging on my doorstep...

583
00:43:35,042 --> 00:43:38,125
- like a whipped dog and a whipped -
- Shall I say it for you, Henry?

584
00:43:38,250 --> 00:43:42,125
Now, now, now. They haven't got
a brass farthing between them.

585
00:43:42,250 --> 00:43:44,792
- I've just done a job for them.
- What do you say?

586
00:43:44,917 --> 00:43:47,792
To print and deliver 500 of these leaflets.

587
00:43:47,875 --> 00:43:50,958
Had to be done tonight.
They paid on the nail too.

588
00:43:55,500 --> 00:43:57,625
What's it say, Henry?

589
00:43:59,667 --> 00:44:03,167
- Shame.
- All right. I got plenty more.

590
00:44:03,292 --> 00:44:08,750
She told me I was to give one to all the folks
I could find at every opportunity.

591
00:44:08,875 --> 00:44:11,583
Uh - Good head for business,
your daughter.

592
00:44:11,708 --> 00:44:14,542
- Takes after you, I suppose.

593
00:44:14,625 --> 00:44:17,000
I see your name's mentioned, Henry.

594
00:44:19,417 --> 00:44:21,917
"Late of Hobson's of Chapel Street."

595
00:44:22,042 --> 00:44:24,375
That's a good advertisement.

596
00:44:24,458 --> 00:44:26,875
Advertisement? Talk.

597
00:44:26,958 --> 00:44:29,542
Moonshine with nought behind it.

598
00:44:29,625 --> 00:44:31,958
Love's gone to their heads.
They've got sick fancies.

599
00:44:32,042 --> 00:44:37,375
Now let's keep sense of proportion.

600
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:42,667
The brains around this table know
there's more to setting up a business...

601
00:44:42,750 --> 00:44:44,708
than handing round bits of paper.

602
00:44:44,833 --> 00:44:47,833
- Aye. Aye!

603
00:45:47,792 --> 00:45:49,792
Time you were getting round
to Tubby's.

604
00:46:01,333 --> 00:46:03,958
You can deliver these leaflets
on your way round in the morning.

605
00:46:05,542 --> 00:46:08,917
I shall be expecting you, come 6:00.

606
00:46:15,250 --> 00:46:18,792
Well, good night, Maggie.

607
00:46:18,917 --> 00:46:21,917
It - It's been a grand day...

608
00:46:22,042 --> 00:46:24,458
and l-I -

609
00:46:28,875 --> 00:46:30,833
You great soft thing.

610
00:47:28,333 --> 00:47:30,250
Good morning, Alice.

611
00:47:30,333 --> 00:47:32,250
Maggie. You here?

612
00:47:32,333 --> 00:47:34,583
I thought I'd just stop in.
Where's Father?

613
00:47:34,667 --> 00:47:37,167
He's out, and lucky for you he is.

614
00:47:37,292 --> 00:47:39,167
Well, you can give him this
when he comes in.

615
00:47:39,292 --> 00:47:42,458
It's an invitation to our wedding tomorrow
and a bit of supper afterwards.

616
00:47:42,542 --> 00:47:45,417
- I expect you all to be there.
- Then you can go on expecting.

617
00:47:45,542 --> 00:47:47,500
Now, you've no need to take that tone
with me, Alice.

618
00:47:47,625 --> 00:47:49,667
<i>- I've given you my word
I'll put things straight for you.</i>

619
00:47:51,083 --> 00:47:55,333
- Eh! Good morning, Miss Maggie.
- Good morning, Tubby.

620
00:47:55,458 --> 00:47:59,000
Alice, there's some brass rings
in that drawer. You can sell me one.

621
00:47:59,125 --> 00:48:01,125
Maggie. What are you doing here?

622
00:48:01,250 --> 00:48:03,208
I'm buying a ring.

623
00:48:05,333 --> 00:48:08,833
No. Oh, this one'll do. Nice fit.

624
00:48:08,958 --> 00:48:10,833
You're not taking it for that?

625
00:48:10,958 --> 00:48:13,208
Will and me are not
throwing our money around.

626
00:48:13,333 --> 00:48:15,458
There's four pence for the ring.
Gather it up, Alice.

627
00:48:15,542 --> 00:48:18,375
Wedded with a brass ring -
a ring out of stock?

628
00:48:18,500 --> 00:48:20,542
They're always out of someone's stock.

629
00:48:20,667 --> 00:48:23,667
Alice, you haven't entered that sale
in your book.

630
00:48:23,750 --> 00:48:25,750
Now I expect you both tomorrow, mind.

631
00:48:25,875 --> 00:48:28,000
I'll not be wed
without my sisters there.

632
00:48:28,083 --> 00:48:30,208
- Good-bye, Miss Maggie.
- Good-bye, Tubby.

633
00:48:31,417 --> 00:48:33,375
Well, I must say, I -

634
00:48:35,875 --> 00:48:38,167
Put this in his bedroom.
I'll not give it to him.

635
00:48:39,500 --> 00:48:41,417
Well, we're all worked up, Miss Alice...

636
00:48:41,500 --> 00:48:45,458
and master will play old Harry if he comes in
and finds us doing nowt in workroom.

637
00:48:45,542 --> 00:48:48,458
- What shall we start on?
- I don't know, but do something.

638
00:48:48,542 --> 00:48:51,333
- I'm not stopping you.
- No, and you're not telling me either.

639
00:48:51,417 --> 00:48:54,500
Course, we can go on making clogs
for stock if you like.

640
00:48:54,625 --> 00:48:56,583
- Then you'd better.
- All right.

641
00:48:56,667 --> 00:49:00,500
- If clogs are your orders, Miss Alice -
- You suggested it.

642
00:49:00,625 --> 00:49:04,125
- I made the remark.
- You don't help us much for an intelligent foreman.

643
00:49:04,208 --> 00:49:08,333
When you've told me what to do,
I'll use my intelligence and see it's done proper.

644
00:49:10,458 --> 00:49:14,625
What is it, Tubby?
Owt wrong?

645
00:49:14,750 --> 00:49:16,625
I've just been giving him
his orders, Father.

646
00:49:16,750 --> 00:49:20,333
Orders? You're supposed to give him
his orders in the morning, not at dinnertime.

647
00:49:20,458 --> 00:49:24,167
Well, get back down now
and start doing what she told you.

648
00:49:24,292 --> 00:49:26,167
And look sharp.

649
00:49:32,417 --> 00:49:34,333
<i>- Vicky.
- Yes, Father?</i>

650
00:49:34,417 --> 00:49:35,875
Dinner.

651
00:49:58,083 --> 00:50:00,833
- What's that?
- Jellied tongue, Father.

652
00:50:00,958 --> 00:50:03,875
Don't make jokes about food.

653
00:50:03,958 --> 00:50:07,208
- We have roast pork Mondays.
- Well, it's cold tongue today, Father.

654
00:50:07,292 --> 00:50:10,125
- You made me the cook.
- I put you in place of cook.

655
00:50:10,208 --> 00:50:12,125
Thou's not made cook yet, my lass.

656
00:50:12,208 --> 00:50:14,667
I'm not hanging over the stove all day.
I've got my looks to think of.

657
00:50:14,750 --> 00:50:19,292
Thou's got nowt to think of but
providing me with my rightful home comforts.

658
00:50:20,958 --> 00:50:23,625
- What's for puddin'?
- Rhubarb.

659
00:50:26,208 --> 00:50:29,833
Alice. Why is my dinner no dinner?

660
00:50:29,917 --> 00:50:32,833
I can't help it. I've got the shop
to look after, and that's a full-time job.

661
00:50:32,917 --> 00:50:34,958
You can't expect us to fill Maggie's place
and our own.

662
00:50:35,083 --> 00:50:38,375
I've got all the housework to do. Do you expect
two pairs of hands to do the work of three?

663
00:50:38,458 --> 00:50:42,083
- I'm busy enough keeping the books and figures.
- I've the beds to make and floors to clean.

664
00:50:42,208 --> 00:50:44,292
Now stop!
I'll not listen to any more.

665
00:50:44,417 --> 00:50:49,958
Three weeks I've stood of this - perversity,
disobedience, incompetence and bad cooking.

666
00:50:50,083 --> 00:50:52,667
And I'll not stand it anymore!

667
00:50:52,792 --> 00:50:56,250
I'm going to where
I can get comfort, good food...

668
00:50:56,333 --> 00:50:58,750
and the respect that's due to me.

669
00:50:58,875 --> 00:51:04,417
I'm going to Moonrakers,
and I shall not be back till late tonight.

670
00:51:40,125 --> 00:51:43,333
-  Thinking things over...

671
00:51:43,417 --> 00:51:45,375
<i>I'm not surprised, for one.</i>

672
00:51:45,500 --> 00:51:47,833
Mind you, I could see it coming
with Maggie.

673
00:51:47,917 --> 00:51:50,208
She's a sharp and grasping nature.

674
00:51:50,333 --> 00:51:52,750
- And what's she got out of it?
- Aye.

675
00:51:52,833 --> 00:51:55,708
- Salford's brightest hope.

676
00:51:55,792 --> 00:51:57,958
Can't read, can't write.

677
00:52:00,083 --> 00:52:03,000
Maggie never had
no sense of style.

678
00:52:03,083 --> 00:52:05,750
Now, other two's quite different.

679
00:52:05,833 --> 00:52:09,625
You mean they're out to catch the eye
in Tudsbury's latest.

680
00:52:10,958 --> 00:52:13,958
Vicky doesn't need a bustle for that.

681
00:52:14,042 --> 00:52:16,167
My friends.

682
00:52:16,292 --> 00:52:19,042
- Hear! Hear!
- Good old Henry.

683
00:52:19,167 --> 00:52:22,708
- And a wonderful little band you are.
- Aye.

684
00:52:22,833 --> 00:52:25,542
Tudsbury, the expert on women...

685
00:52:25,667 --> 00:52:29,708
just because he spends his life
fitting on their petticoats.

686
00:52:29,833 --> 00:52:33,500
You're nowt
but an old woman yourself, Tudsbury.

687
00:52:33,583 --> 00:52:35,500
Now, now, Henry.

688
00:52:38,417 --> 00:52:41,583
As for you, you're nowt but a shadow.

689
00:52:41,708 --> 00:52:45,750
Our Maggie saw through you years ago -
totting at me heels...

690
00:52:45,875 --> 00:52:49,792
buttering me up with your "Yes, Henry"
and your "No, Henry"...

691
00:52:49,875 --> 00:52:53,000
all for sake of free drinks you get.

692
00:52:57,333 --> 00:53:00,542
Looking for pink rats, Denton?

693
00:53:00,667 --> 00:53:03,833
You're the biggest old soak in Salford.

694
00:53:06,083 --> 00:53:08,417
You're rotten with alcohol...

695
00:53:08,542 --> 00:53:11,833
rotten as the fish
you sell on Mondays.

696
00:53:11,917 --> 00:53:13,917
Now then, Henry,
that's enough of that.

697
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:15,917
Fish. That's what I am.

698
00:53:17,750 --> 00:53:20,917
Big fish, little pond.

699
00:53:23,958 --> 00:53:29,875
It's a stinking little pond,
and I'm getting out of it!

700
00:53:36,625 --> 00:53:38,667
<i>
No ill feeling, gentlemen, I hope.</i>

701
00:53:38,792 --> 00:53:40,667
<i>We all know Henry.</i>

702
00:53:41,708 --> 00:53:44,458
<i>Once wedding's over tomorrow,
you'll feel better.</i>

703
00:53:47,292 --> 00:53:50,542
As for you, Sam Minns...

704
00:53:50,667 --> 00:53:54,583
my Mary always said you were a robber,
and you are.

705
00:53:54,708 --> 00:53:56,583
- Systematic swindling!
- Shh! Henry!

706
00:53:56,708 --> 00:53:58,583
That's what it is.

707
00:53:58,708 --> 00:54:01,833
We all of us pay too much for drinks
once we've had a few.

708
00:54:01,958 --> 00:54:07,000
<i> Poor old Denton
hasn't had right change for 20 years.</i>

709
00:54:12,792 --> 00:54:14,917
I'm off.

710
00:58:31,750 --> 00:58:33,875
Oh. Good.

711
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,250
Are you coming to my wedding
with a face like that?

712
00:58:36,333 --> 00:58:38,917
You let me in, and perhaps
your face will be like mine.

713
00:58:39,042 --> 00:58:42,000
It's your father.
He's asleep in our cellar.

714
00:58:42,125 --> 00:58:44,292
Oh, come in.
That won't upset my face.

715
00:58:45,417 --> 00:58:48,292
<i>- Well, go on.
- Well, I daren't leave him there any longer.</i>

716
00:58:48,375 --> 00:58:50,417
If the old man finds him,
you know what'll happen.

717
00:58:50,542 --> 00:58:54,083
Him being temperance and all.
It'll be the end of Vicky and me.

718
00:58:54,208 --> 00:58:57,583
- He may wake up at any moment.
- When he's like this, he'll sleep till midday...

719
00:58:57,708 --> 00:58:59,708
cellar or no cellar.

720
00:58:59,792 --> 00:59:03,583
- What are you smiling at?
- Well, in the first place, it's my wedding day.

721
00:59:03,708 --> 00:59:07,750
And in the second,
I think I've got an idea.

722
00:59:07,875 --> 00:59:10,417
- I'll be ready in a moment.
- Hmm?

723
00:59:35,875 --> 00:59:38,792
You might well look surprised, Will.
A lot's gone on this morning.

724
00:59:38,917 --> 00:59:41,042
Morning, Miss Alice.
Miss Vicky.

725
00:59:41,125 --> 00:59:43,875
- You call them Alice and Vicky now, Will.
-  No, he doesn't!

726
00:59:43,958 --> 00:59:46,208
Now listen.
You two had better get this straight.

727
00:59:46,292 --> 00:59:48,208
We've come to an arrangement
this morning...

728
00:59:48,292 --> 00:59:50,583
and if you want your Albert,
and you want your Freddy...

729
00:59:50,667 --> 00:59:52,583
you'll be respectful to my Willie.

730
00:59:52,667 --> 00:59:54,792
- Isn't that right, Albert?
- Yes, it's quite right, Alice.

731
00:59:54,875 --> 00:59:57,667
Good. Now you can both kiss Willie
for your brother-in-law-to-be.

732
00:59:57,792 --> 01:00:00,417
Oh, well, I - I - I'd as soon
not put them to the trouble.

733
01:00:00,500 --> 01:00:03,167
Stand still, Will.
They're making up their minds to it.

734
01:00:03,292 --> 01:00:06,125
- It's under protest.
- Protest, but kiss.

735
01:00:08,708 --> 01:00:10,958
- Good.
- It's your turn now, Vicky.

736
01:00:11,083 --> 01:00:13,000
You're to kiss him hearty now.

737
01:00:13,083 --> 01:00:15,000
- Freddy.
- Do as she says, Vicky.

738
01:00:17,375 --> 01:00:19,833
- Here's the ring. You're best man.
- Oh.

739
01:00:19,917 --> 01:00:21,875
Now go along.
I'll see you all inside.

740
01:00:21,958 --> 01:00:24,833
<i>- I want to have a word with Willie.</i>

741
01:00:29,958 --> 01:00:31,875
How you feeling, lad?

742
01:00:31,958 --> 01:00:35,500
Me mind's made up.
I've got wrought up to point. I'm ready.

743
01:00:35,625 --> 01:00:37,542
It's church we're going to,
not dentist's.

744
01:00:37,667 --> 01:00:40,208
I know.
You get rid of summat at dentist's.

745
01:00:40,333 --> 01:00:42,792
But it's taking summat on
to go to church with a wench.

746
01:00:42,875 --> 01:00:45,500
Listen, Will.
I've a respect for church.

747
01:00:45,583 --> 01:00:47,875
Parson's going to ask you if you love me.

748
01:00:47,958 --> 01:00:49,875
And you'll either answer truthfully...

749
01:00:49,958 --> 01:00:51,875
or not at all.

750
01:00:51,958 --> 01:00:55,208
I'll tell him... yes.

751
01:00:55,333 --> 01:00:58,042
- And truthfully?
- Yes, Maggie.

752
01:00:58,125 --> 01:01:01,792
I'm resigned.
Y-You're growing on me.

753
01:01:01,917 --> 01:01:03,833
I'll toe the line with you.

754
01:02:27,625 --> 01:02:29,583
Thank you.

755
01:02:29,667 --> 01:02:31,625
- Henry Hobson?
- Aye.

756
01:03:05,625 --> 01:03:07,625
To the bride and bridegroom.

757
01:03:11,750 --> 01:03:14,875
- I think he ought to say something.
- Come on, Willie. Let's hear you, Willie.

758
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:17,333
Come on. Let's have a speech.

759
01:03:21,083 --> 01:03:24,125
It's a very great pleasure to us
to see you here tonight.

760
01:03:24,250 --> 01:03:28,958
It's an honor you do us.
And I assure you, speaking for my-

761
01:03:29,042 --> 01:03:31,792
my wife, as well as myself...

762
01:03:31,875 --> 01:03:34,375
<i>- that the, uh-
- Generous.</i>

763
01:03:34,500 --> 01:03:37,458
Oh, aye. That's right. That the generous
warmth of the sentiments...

764
01:03:37,583 --> 01:03:39,458
expressed by Mr. Beenstock...

765
01:03:39,583 --> 01:03:42,250
and so enthusiastically seconded -

766
01:03:43,958 --> 01:03:47,417
No, I've gotten that wrong road round.
Expressed by Mr. Prosser...

767
01:03:47,542 --> 01:03:51,250
<i>and seconded by Mr. Beenstock
will never be forgotten...</i>

768
01:03:51,333 --> 01:03:53,708
<i>by either my life partner or self.</i>

769
01:03:53,792 --> 01:03:57,875
And I'd like to drink this toast
to you in my own house.

770
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:01,875
Our guests. And may they soon
be married soon themselves.

771
01:04:02,042 --> 01:04:03,917
- Hear, hear!
- Hear, hear!

772
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:06,250
Our guests.

773
01:04:06,292 --> 01:04:09,292
- Hooray!
- A speech indeed!

774
01:04:09,417 --> 01:04:11,917
<i> I'm free to own
you took me by surprise, Will.</i>

775
01:04:12,042 --> 01:04:15,042
<i>-  Who taught you, Willie?
- I've been learning a lot lately.</i>

776
01:04:15,167 --> 01:04:18,333
- Maggie's schooling me.
- Now, Will, we better be getting cleared away...

777
01:04:18,417 --> 01:04:20,375
- ready for Father.
- Oh.

778
01:04:21,625 --> 01:04:24,167
- Well, come on.
- What makes you so sure he'll come?

779
01:04:24,292 --> 01:04:27,250
He'll be wanting advice,
and he certainly won't go to a lawyer.

780
01:04:27,375 --> 01:04:30,042
It's getting dark, so he'll judge
it's safe to come without being seen.

781
01:04:30,125 --> 01:04:32,083
- I'm a bit nervous.
- You've no need to worry.

782
01:04:32,208 --> 01:04:36,000
When he comes, you're all to go into
the bedroom and stay there until you're called.

783
01:04:36,125 --> 01:04:38,958
I'll manage the rest.
Oh. Get busy with the washing up, Will.

784
01:04:39,042 --> 01:04:40,958
- Yes, Maggie.
-

785
01:04:41,042 --> 01:04:43,000
And you and Freddy
can just lend him a hand.

786
01:04:43,125 --> 01:04:44,750
- Eh?
- Maggie, they're guests.

787
01:04:44,833 --> 01:04:46,750
I know. But Albert laughed at Willie.

788
01:04:46,875 --> 01:04:49,458
And washing up would maybe
make him think it's not allowed.

789
01:05:12,167 --> 01:05:14,958
<i>-  It's Father.</i>

790
01:05:16,458 --> 01:05:18,458
No, not you, Will.

791
01:05:20,208 --> 01:05:22,167
Come and sit down.

792
01:05:26,667 --> 01:05:29,417
And remember.
You're the master here.

793
01:05:35,208 --> 01:05:37,292
Well, Maggie?

794
01:05:37,417 --> 01:05:40,167
Well, Father?

795
01:05:40,292 --> 01:05:43,042
- I'll come in.
- Well, I don't know about that.

796
01:05:43,167 --> 01:05:45,167
- I shall have to ask the master first.
- The master?

797
01:05:45,292 --> 01:05:48,417
Will, it's me father.
Is he to come in?

798
01:05:48,542 --> 01:05:50,500
Aye. Let him come in.

799
01:06:00,625 --> 01:06:02,917
I'm right glad to see you, Mr. Hobson.

800
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:06,250
It makes the wedding day complete like,
you being her father and -

801
01:06:06,333 --> 01:06:08,417
That'll do, Will.
You don't need to overdo it.

802
01:06:08,542 --> 01:06:10,458
Give me your hat, Father.

803
01:06:10,542 --> 01:06:13,125
You can sit down.
You're a bit late for the wedding do...

804
01:06:13,250 --> 01:06:15,375
but we're very glad to see you
just the same.

805
01:06:15,500 --> 01:06:18,667
- Piece of, uh, pork pie, Mr. Hobson?
- Pork pie.

806
01:06:18,792 --> 01:06:21,458
Well, you're going to be sociable
now you're here, I hope.

807
01:06:21,542 --> 01:06:24,917
It wasn't sociability
that brought me here, Maggie.

808
01:06:25,042 --> 01:06:27,875
- I'm in trouble.
- Well...

809
01:06:27,958 --> 01:06:30,125
happen a piece of wedding cake
will do you good.

810
01:06:30,208 --> 01:06:33,208
- That's sweet.
- That's natural in cake.

811
01:06:33,333 --> 01:06:35,958
I'll allow it's foolishness,
but I've a mind to see my father...

812
01:06:36,083 --> 01:06:39,667
sitting at my table eating
my wedding cake on my wedding day.

813
01:06:39,750 --> 01:06:42,375
Now, Maggie, I'm none proud
of the choice you made...

814
01:06:42,458 --> 01:06:44,375
but I've shaken your husband's hand.

815
01:06:44,458 --> 01:06:47,833
- That's a sign for ya.
- Well, here's your cake, and you can eat it.

816
01:06:47,958 --> 01:06:50,417
Now, I've given you me word
there's no ill feeling.

817
01:06:50,542 --> 01:06:52,500
Well, now we'll have the deed.

818
01:06:53,750 --> 01:06:56,583
You're a hard woman.

819
01:07:15,167 --> 01:07:17,208
Pass me that tea.

820
01:07:27,708 --> 01:07:29,667
That's easier.

821
01:07:31,750 --> 01:07:34,333
Maggie...

822
01:07:34,458 --> 01:07:37,208
it's a very serious thing
I've come about.

823
01:07:37,333 --> 01:07:39,917
Then I'll leave you alone
with my husband to talk it over.

824
01:07:40,042 --> 01:07:41,917
Maggie.

825
01:07:42,042 --> 01:07:45,125
You can discuss it man-to-man
with no fools of women about.

826
01:07:45,208 --> 01:07:47,333
- Give me a call when you're finished, Will.
- Maggie.

827
01:07:47,417 --> 01:07:49,792
- Hmm?
- It's private.

828
01:07:49,875 --> 01:07:52,417
Private from Will?
Nay, it isn't.

829
01:07:52,542 --> 01:07:56,375
- Will's in the family now.
- I'm to tell you this with him there?

830
01:07:56,458 --> 01:07:59,583
- Will and me's one.
- Sit down, Mr. Hobson.

831
01:07:59,708 --> 01:08:02,917
- You call him Father now.
- Do I?

832
01:08:03,042 --> 01:08:05,042
- Does he?
- He does.

833
01:08:05,125 --> 01:08:07,125
Sit down, Will.

834
01:08:08,208 --> 01:08:11,625
Now then, Father,
if you're ready, we are.

835
01:08:26,707 --> 01:08:30,457
Hmm. It's an action for trespass
and damages, I see.

836
01:08:30,582 --> 01:08:34,625
It's a stab in the back.
It's an unfair, un-English way...

837
01:08:34,707 --> 01:08:37,417
of taking a mean advantage
of a casual accident.

838
01:08:40,125 --> 01:08:43,167
- Did you trespass?
- Maggie, I - I had an accident.

839
01:08:43,250 --> 01:08:46,082
I - I don't deny it.
I'd been in Moonrakers.

840
01:08:46,167 --> 01:08:50,542
I'd stayed too long.
I fell in that cellar, I slept in that cellar...

841
01:08:50,625 --> 01:08:53,082
and I awoke to this catastrophe.

842
01:08:53,167 --> 01:08:58,750
Lawyers, law costs, publicity,
ruin and bankruptcy.

843
01:08:58,832 --> 01:09:03,832
I've hated lawyers all me life,
and they've got me in the end.

844
01:09:03,957 --> 01:09:08,082
I'm in their grip at last.
They'll squeeze me dry for it.

845
01:09:08,207 --> 01:09:11,917
My word! And that's summat
like a squeeze and all.

846
01:09:12,042 --> 01:09:13,917
<i>
Aye. I can see it's serious.</i>

847
01:09:14,042 --> 01:09:17,082
I shouldn't wonder if you didn't
lose some trade through this.

848
01:09:17,207 --> 01:09:19,667
Wonder? It's as certain as Christmas.

849
01:09:19,792 --> 01:09:21,917
My good-class customers are not
gonna buy their boots...

850
01:09:22,042 --> 01:09:24,457
from a man
who stood up in open court...

851
01:09:24,582 --> 01:09:27,250
and had to acknowledge he was...

852
01:09:27,332 --> 01:09:29,957
overcome in a public street.

853
01:09:30,082 --> 01:09:32,250
Do you think it'll get in paper, Maggie?

854
01:09:32,332 --> 01:09:34,750
<i>Aye. You'll see your name
in Salford Reporter, Father.</i>

855
01:09:34,832 --> 01:09:37,542
<i>Salford Reporter?</i>

856
01:09:37,667 --> 01:09:40,542
When ruin and disaster
overwhelm a man of my importance...

857
01:09:40,667 --> 01:09:43,625
<i>it's reported in Manchester Guardian...</i>

858
01:09:43,707 --> 01:09:46,832
<i>for the whole country to read.</i>

859
01:09:46,957 --> 01:09:49,875
Eh, by gum! Think of that.

860
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:53,167
Why, it's very near
worthwhile to be ruined...

861
01:09:53,250 --> 01:09:56,083
for pleasure of reading
about yourself in printed paper.

862
01:09:56,208 --> 01:09:58,542
It's there for others to read
beside myself, my lad.

863
01:09:58,625 --> 01:10:04,583
Aye. You're right. This'll give a lot
of satisfaction to many as I could name.

864
01:10:04,625 --> 01:10:08,917
Other people's troubles is mostly
what folks read paper for.

865
01:10:09,042 --> 01:10:11,125
<i>And I reckon it's twice
the pleasure to 'em...</i>

866
01:10:11,250 --> 01:10:13,917
<i>when it's trouble of a man
they know themselves.</i>

867
01:10:14,042 --> 01:10:17,667
To hear you talk,
it sounds like a pleasure to you.

868
01:10:17,792 --> 01:10:23,042
Nay, it's not. But I always think it's best
to look on the worst side of things first.

869
01:10:23,167 --> 01:10:25,083
There's St. Phillip's now.

870
01:10:25,167 --> 01:10:29,042
<i>And I don't suppose you'll go on
being vicar's warden after this to-do.</i>

871
01:10:29,167 --> 01:10:32,625
And it brought you a powerful lot
of customers from the church did that.

872
01:10:33,875 --> 01:10:37,375
I'm getting a lot of comfort
from your husband, Maggie.

873
01:10:37,500 --> 01:10:39,125
Happen it's what you deserve.

874
01:10:40,667 --> 01:10:44,750
Have you, uh, got any more
consolation for me, Will?

875
01:10:44,875 --> 01:10:47,250
I only spoke
what came into me mind.

876
01:10:47,333 --> 01:10:49,292
Have you spoken it all?

877
01:10:49,375 --> 01:10:51,583
I - I - I can keep me mouth shut
if you'd rather.

878
01:10:51,708 --> 01:10:54,167
Now don't strain yourself, Will Mossop.

879
01:10:54,292 --> 01:10:57,625
When a man's mind is full of thoughts
like yours, they're better out than in.

880
01:10:57,708 --> 01:11:00,167
I'm sorry,
but I thought you came here for advice.

881
01:11:00,292 --> 01:11:02,583
Not from you,
you jumped-up cock-a-hooping -

882
01:11:02,667 --> 01:11:04,750
<i>That'll do, Father.</i>

883
01:11:04,833 --> 01:11:06,833
My husband's trying to help you.

884
01:11:10,375 --> 01:11:14,292
- Yes, Maggie.
- Now, about this accident of yours.

885
01:11:14,375 --> 01:11:16,292
It's the publicity you're afraid of most.

886
01:11:16,417 --> 01:11:19,667
It's being brought into
a court of law at all.

887
01:11:19,750 --> 01:11:22,958
<i>- Then we must keep it out of court.
- That won't be so easy.</i>

888
01:11:23,083 --> 01:11:26,417
It's a lawyer's job to squeeze a man...

889
01:11:26,542 --> 01:11:31,708
and squeeze him where
his squirming's seen most - in court.

890
01:11:31,792 --> 01:11:35,417
Now I'll tell you something, Father.
I expected you tonight.

891
01:11:35,542 --> 01:11:37,958
You expected me?

892
01:11:38,042 --> 01:11:42,000
<i>Yes. I knew about this action this morning,
and I knew it'd bring you to me.</i>

893
01:11:42,125 --> 01:11:44,875
So I arranged for the interested parties
to be present.

894
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:46,667
Parties?

895
01:11:46,792 --> 01:11:50,500
Aye. You can settle it... here.

896
01:11:53,542 --> 01:11:56,208
<i>Mr. Prosser. Mr. Beenstock.</i>

897
01:11:59,250 --> 01:12:02,917
Father, this is Mr. Prosser
of Prosser, Pilkington and Prosser.

898
01:12:03,042 --> 01:12:04,917
Evening, Mr. Hobson.

899
01:12:05,042 --> 01:12:07,542
- Are you a lawyer?
- Yes, I'm a lawyer.

900
01:12:08,667 --> 01:12:10,750
At your age.

901
01:12:10,875 --> 01:12:13,583
And this is Mr. Frederick Beenstock,
representing plaintiffs.

902
01:12:13,667 --> 01:12:16,042
- How do you do, sir?
- Do?

903
01:12:16,167 --> 01:12:19,917
Sit down, Father- there.
Mr. Prosser.

904
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:21,917
- Mr. Beenstock.
- Thanks very much.

905
01:12:24,958 --> 01:12:26,875
There.

906
01:12:26,958 --> 01:12:30,083
- Ah, shall we get to business, sir?
- Young man...

907
01:12:30,208 --> 01:12:33,667
don't abuse a noble word.

908
01:12:33,792 --> 01:12:38,917
Now, my client informs me that he's quite
prepared to settle this matter out of court.

909
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:40,917
Personally, I don't advise him to...

910
01:12:41,042 --> 01:12:43,250
'cause we should probably get
higher damages in court.

911
01:12:43,375 --> 01:12:46,500
Yes, you bloodsucking,
money-grabbing -

912
01:12:46,583 --> 01:12:49,083
One moment, Mr. Hobson.
You can call me what you like -

913
01:12:49,208 --> 01:12:51,208
And I shall, you primped-up -

914
01:12:51,333 --> 01:12:53,542
But I wish to inform you,
for your own interests...

915
01:12:53,625 --> 01:12:56,750
that abuse of a lawyer
is remembered in costs.

916
01:13:01,458 --> 01:13:04,375
Now, my client has no desire
to be vindictive.

917
01:13:04,500 --> 01:13:08,542
He remembers your position,
your reputation for respectability and -

918
01:13:08,625 --> 01:13:10,583
- How much?
- I beg your pardon?

919
01:13:10,667 --> 01:13:14,333
I'm not so fond of the sound of your
voice as you are. What's the figure?

920
01:13:16,375 --> 01:13:19,667
The sum we propose,
which includes my ordinary costs...

921
01:13:19,792 --> 01:13:24,000
but not any additional costs incurred
by your use of defamatory language to me...

922
01:13:24,083 --> 01:13:25,542
is £1,000.

923
01:13:25,667 --> 01:13:27,750
What?

924
01:13:27,875 --> 01:13:29,542
By gum!

925
01:13:29,625 --> 01:13:32,583
Albert Prosser, I can see
you're going to get on in the world...

926
01:13:32,667 --> 01:13:34,583
but you needn't be greedy here.

927
01:13:34,667 --> 01:13:36,583
- 1,000's too much.
- We thought -

928
01:13:36,667 --> 01:13:38,125
- You can think again.
- But -

929
01:13:38,250 --> 01:13:40,625
If there are any more signs
of greediness from you two...

930
01:13:40,750 --> 01:13:43,167
there'll be a counteraction
for personal damages...

931
01:13:43,292 --> 01:13:46,750
due to your criminal carelessness
in leaving the cellar flap open.

932
01:13:46,875 --> 01:13:49,333
Maggie, you've saved me!

933
01:13:49,458 --> 01:13:52,333
I'll bring that action.
I'll show them up.

934
01:13:52,458 --> 01:13:55,792
Well, you're not damaged, and you'll
have to go into court to prove it.

935
01:13:59,042 --> 01:14:02,333
I know what my father can afford,
and it isn't anything like £1,000.

936
01:14:02,458 --> 01:14:05,292
Not so much of your "can't afford,"
Maggie. You'll make me out a pauper.

937
01:14:05,375 --> 01:14:07,750
You can afford 500,
and you're going to pay 500.

938
01:14:07,875 --> 01:14:10,708
Can we take it as settled then?

939
01:14:12,167 --> 01:14:14,583
Do you want to see the money
before you believe me?

940
01:14:14,708 --> 01:14:19,042
- Is that your nasty lawyer's way?
- Not at all, Mr. Hobson.

941
01:14:19,125 --> 01:14:21,042
- Good.
- I don't see what's good about it.

942
01:14:21,125 --> 01:14:23,750
It's a tidy sum of money
to be going out of the family.

943
01:14:23,833 --> 01:14:27,417
- It isn't going out of the family, Father.
- I don't see how you make that out.

944
01:14:32,458 --> 01:14:34,333
You can come out, both of you.

945
01:14:34,458 --> 01:14:37,000
It's all settled.

946
01:14:40,333 --> 01:14:43,042
<i>-  Where did they come from?
-  My bedroom.</i>

947
01:14:43,167 --> 01:14:47,333
Maggie, I wish you'd explain
before my brain gives way.

948
01:14:47,417 --> 01:14:50,917
It's quite simple, Father.
They're going to be married.

949
01:14:52,250 --> 01:14:54,167
- Married?
- Yes, Father.

950
01:14:54,250 --> 01:14:56,167
You wanted the girls off your hands...

951
01:14:56,250 --> 01:14:59,083
and here's a pair of young men
who'll take them for you.

952
01:14:59,208 --> 01:15:01,417
That's very kind of them,
but I think you've made...

953
01:15:01,542 --> 01:15:04,083
a slight miscalculation, me lass.

954
01:15:04,208 --> 01:15:07,208
I have the painful duty
of reminding you two young ladies...

955
01:15:07,292 --> 01:15:11,083
<i>of a little question
of marriage settlements.</i>

956
01:15:11,167 --> 01:15:15,250
Now, I've got the measure
of these two footpads.

957
01:15:15,333 --> 01:15:18,625
And if they think
they can get settlements out of me...

958
01:15:18,708 --> 01:15:23,083
when I've just been tricked
into giving them 500 -

959
01:15:26,167 --> 01:15:28,833
<i>250 apiece, Father.</i>

960
01:15:31,375 --> 01:15:34,708
Do you mean to tell me -

961
01:15:34,833 --> 01:15:37,167
Now, you won't forget you've passed
your word, will you, Father?

962
01:15:38,250 --> 01:15:40,417
I've been diddled.

963
01:15:40,542 --> 01:15:44,750
It clears the shop of all those fools
of women that used to get in your way.

964
01:15:44,833 --> 01:15:47,833
Aye. And they can stay out of me way.
You hear that, all of you?

965
01:15:47,958 --> 01:15:50,083
- Father!
- I'll run that shop with men...

966
01:15:50,208 --> 01:15:52,708
and I'll show Salford
how it should be run.

967
01:15:52,833 --> 01:15:56,625
And I'm not blind yet, and I can see
who it is I've got to thank for this.

968
01:15:56,708 --> 01:16:01,042
I'm sorry for you, Will Mossop.

969
01:16:01,167 --> 01:16:03,875
<i>Taken all in all,
you're best in bunch.</i>

970
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:07,375
You're a backward lad, but you know
your trade, and it's an honest one.

971
01:16:07,458 --> 01:16:11,333
<i>Aye. You may grin, you two...</i>

972
01:16:11,417 --> 01:16:15,292
but you wait till the families
begin to come.

973
01:16:15,375 --> 01:16:17,292
<i>-  Father!
- Aye. You'll know...</i>

974
01:16:17,417 --> 01:16:20,917
what marrying a woman means
before very long.

975
01:16:21,042 --> 01:16:24,542
I've suffered 30 years and more.

976
01:16:24,667 --> 01:16:27,417
And I'm a free man today!

977
01:16:33,958 --> 01:16:36,000
Oh, Maggie, thank you!

978
01:16:36,125 --> 01:16:40,000
- You're welcome, love.
- It's settled! It's settled! Hooray!

979
01:16:40,125 --> 01:16:42,417
Vicky!

980
01:16:42,542 --> 01:16:46,458
Well, time we were going, hmm?

981
01:16:46,542 --> 01:16:49,458
Oh, yes. You'll be glad
to see the back of us.

982
01:16:49,583 --> 01:16:52,167
No, no. I - I wouldn't dream
of asking you to go.

983
01:16:52,250 --> 01:16:54,708
Then I would.
It's about time we turned you out.

984
01:16:54,792 --> 01:16:56,792
- Come and get your things.
- I, uh -

985
01:16:56,875 --> 01:16:59,125
I don't see why you need
to go away so soon.

986
01:16:59,250 --> 01:17:01,375
- Why not?
- Ah, well, I'm -

987
01:17:01,458 --> 01:17:03,375
I'm fond of a bit of company.

988
01:17:03,458 --> 01:17:05,458
Do you want company
on your wedding night?

989
01:17:05,583 --> 01:17:08,333
Well, l-I've not been married before,
you see, and...

990
01:17:08,458 --> 01:17:10,625
I freely own I'm feeling awkward like.

991
01:17:10,750 --> 01:17:12,667
You've been engaged to her,
haven't you?

992
01:17:12,792 --> 01:17:14,708
Aye, but it weren't for long.

993
01:17:14,833 --> 01:17:17,083
And, you see, Maggie's not the sort
you get familiar with.

994
01:17:19,417 --> 01:17:21,333
- Good night, Will.
- Good night.

995
01:17:21,417 --> 01:17:23,333
Good night, Maggie.
Good night, Willie.

996
01:17:23,417 --> 01:17:25,042
- Good night, Maggie.
- Good night, Will.

997
01:17:25,167 --> 01:17:27,542
<i>-  Don't forget your hat.
- Oh, have you got my hat, Alice?</i>

998
01:17:29,667 --> 01:17:32,958
<i>-
You'll be too grand for us afterwards.
-  Oh, no, Maggie, we won't.</i>

999
01:17:33,083 --> 01:17:35,042
<i> Happen we'll be
catching up with you before long.</i>

1000
01:17:35,167 --> 01:17:37,125
<i>- We're only starting here.
- Good night, Maggie.</i>

1001
01:17:37,250 --> 01:17:39,542
<i>-  Good night.</i>

1002
01:17:47,208 --> 01:17:49,083
I'll tell you something, Will.

1003
01:17:49,208 --> 01:17:51,625
In a few years time,
you're going to be thought more of...

1004
01:17:51,708 --> 01:17:54,625
<i>- than either of your brothers-in-law.</i>

1005
01:17:54,708 --> 01:17:58,000
I don't know.
They have a long start on us.

1006
01:17:58,125 --> 01:18:00,625
Aye.
But you've got me.

1007
01:18:00,750 --> 01:18:03,125
Now, your slate's in bedroom.
Bring it out.

1008
01:18:03,208 --> 01:18:05,625
I'll have the table cleared
by the time you get back.

1009
01:18:16,333 --> 01:18:18,250
Oh, let me see it first.

1010
01:18:18,375 --> 01:18:20,292
That's what you did
last night at Tubby's?

1011
01:18:21,333 --> 01:18:23,750
Yes, your writing's improving, Will.

1012
01:18:23,833 --> 01:18:27,042
I'll just set you a short copy
for tonight because it's getting late.

1013
01:18:35,208 --> 01:18:38,917
There... is...

1014
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:41,083
always...

1015
01:18:42,167 --> 01:18:44,292
room...

1016
01:18:44,417 --> 01:18:46,542
at...

1017
01:18:46,667 --> 01:18:48,625
the top.

1018
01:18:51,708 --> 01:18:54,292
There. Now you can copy that.

1019
01:19:06,167 --> 01:19:09,083
I think I'll throw these flowers
of Mrs. Hepworth's away, Will.

1020
01:19:09,167 --> 01:19:11,667
We'll not be wanting litter
come working time tomorrow.

1021
01:19:27,833 --> 01:19:31,292
I thought I'd press it in me Bible
for a keepsake, Will.

1022
01:19:31,375 --> 01:19:34,542
I'm not beyond liking
to be reminded of this day.

1023
01:19:36,667 --> 01:19:40,583
Oh, I'm tired.
I reckon I'll leave pots till morning.

1024
01:19:40,708 --> 01:19:44,583
It's a slackish way of starting,
but I don't get married every day.

1025
01:19:44,667 --> 01:19:46,917
No.

1026
01:19:47,042 --> 01:19:50,875
Well, I'm for bed.
You finish one copy before you come.

1027
01:23:26,708 --> 01:23:28,750
<i>Willie.</i>

1028
01:23:28,875 --> 01:23:30,792
Yes, Maggie?

1029
01:23:30,875 --> 01:23:32,583
<i>
I'm ready.</i>

1030
01:25:26,625 --> 01:25:29,500
By gum!

1031
01:25:29,625 --> 01:25:31,542
You get to work, my lad.

1032
01:25:31,625 --> 01:25:33,667
You'll have your breakfast
as soon as it's made.

1033
01:25:44,833 --> 01:25:46,792
A customer.

1034
01:25:50,875 --> 01:25:52,917
- Good morning, madam.
- Morning, mum.

1035
01:25:53,042 --> 01:25:54,958
Good morning.

1036
01:25:56,083 --> 01:25:58,042
A pair of bootlaces, please.

1037
01:25:58,167 --> 01:26:00,083
Certainly, madam.

1038
01:26:02,208 --> 01:26:04,375
That'll be one penny, madam.

1039
01:26:04,500 --> 01:26:06,417
Thank you.

1040
01:26:06,500 --> 01:26:08,667
- Good morning.
- Morning, mum.

1041
01:26:20,125 --> 01:26:22,083
By gum!

1042
01:27:02,667 --> 01:27:04,917
Willie.

1043
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:07,000
Willie.

1044
01:27:12,958 --> 01:27:14,917
Well, where have you been?

1045
01:27:21,667 --> 01:27:23,917
I'm going to give you a shock.

1046
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:25,958
<i>I doubt it.</i>

1047
01:27:27,083 --> 01:27:31,250
<i>I've just paid out £1 20.</i>

1048
01:27:31,333 --> 01:27:33,792
- What?
- To Mrs. Hepworth.

1049
01:27:33,917 --> 01:27:35,875
That's her capital, plus 20%.

1050
01:27:36,958 --> 01:27:38,875
There's the receipt.

1051
01:27:38,958 --> 01:27:40,875
We can do without her now.

1052
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:43,125
It looks as though
you can do without me too.

1053
01:27:43,250 --> 01:27:46,792
Maggie. I thought to please you.

1054
01:27:47,875 --> 01:27:49,833
You do. You do.

1055
01:27:50,875 --> 01:27:53,292
Only I like to have a finger in the pie.

1056
01:27:54,917 --> 01:27:58,042
God knows,
you made the whole pie, Maggie.

1057
01:27:58,167 --> 01:28:01,375
I - I meant to give you
a little surprise.

1058
01:28:01,458 --> 01:28:04,667
It's all right, lad.
I'm not complaining.

1059
01:28:04,750 --> 01:28:09,125
It's New Year's Eve, and we can
start tomorrow with a clean slate.

1060
01:28:09,208 --> 01:28:12,667
You know, I feel quite intoxicated.

1061
01:28:12,792 --> 01:28:14,667
We've enough of that in the family...

1062
01:28:14,792 --> 01:28:16,667
especially on New Year's Eve.

1063
01:28:16,792 --> 01:28:18,875
Come on, me lad.
Get out of that best coat...

1064
01:28:18,958 --> 01:28:20,875
and help me get some supper.

1065
01:30:12,583 --> 01:30:15,042
- Fetch the doctor.
- Yes, sir.

1066
01:30:15,167 --> 01:30:18,083
Oh. Oh, Jim. Oh, Jim.

1067
01:30:18,167 --> 01:30:20,125
Henry.

1068
01:30:21,375 --> 01:30:23,417
- What is it, lad?
- I don't know.

1069
01:30:23,542 --> 01:30:25,625
A bit of a liver attack maybe.

1070
01:30:25,750 --> 01:30:28,000
Oh, worse than that, Jim.
It's worse than that.

1071
01:30:28,125 --> 01:30:30,000
Here. Come on.
Back into bed.

1072
01:30:30,125 --> 01:30:32,792
Come on. That's it.

1073
01:30:32,917 --> 01:30:35,250
The doctor will soon be here.

1074
01:30:37,667 --> 01:30:40,292
I'm seeing no doctor in bed.

1075
01:30:41,333 --> 01:30:44,167
I'll face him downstairs.

1076
01:30:44,250 --> 01:30:45,333
<i>Oh.</i>

1077
01:30:45,417 --> 01:30:47,708
Get me my clothes.

1078
01:30:56,292 --> 01:30:58,250
Mm-hmm.

1079
01:30:59,417 --> 01:31:02,292
- You had a breakdown this morning.
- Aye.

1080
01:31:02,417 --> 01:31:04,792
Hold your hands out.

1081
01:31:07,167 --> 01:31:10,042
And do you honestly require me
to tell you the cause, Mr. Hobson?

1082
01:31:10,167 --> 01:31:12,625
I'm paying thee brass to tell me.

1083
01:31:12,750 --> 01:31:15,000
Chronic alcoholism,
if you know what I mean.

1084
01:31:15,083 --> 01:31:17,000
- Aye.
- A serious case.

1085
01:31:17,125 --> 01:31:19,958
I know it's serious. You're not here
to tell me what I already know.

1086
01:31:20,042 --> 01:31:22,000
You're here to cure me.

1087
01:31:22,083 --> 01:31:24,125
Have you a wife, Mr. Hobson?

1088
01:31:25,375 --> 01:31:28,583
- In bed?
- Higher than that.

1089
01:31:28,708 --> 01:31:30,833
A pity.

1090
01:31:30,958 --> 01:31:33,208
<i>A man like you
should keep a wife handy.</i>

1091
01:31:33,292 --> 01:31:35,500
I'm not so partial to women.

1092
01:31:37,167 --> 01:31:39,542
Now you stop that.
None of your druggist's muck for me.

1093
01:31:39,625 --> 01:31:42,167
I'm particular what I put in my stomach.

1094
01:31:42,292 --> 01:31:45,375
Mr. Hobson,
if you don't mend your manners...

1095
01:31:45,458 --> 01:31:48,250
I shall certify ye.

1096
01:31:48,333 --> 01:31:52,792
Are you aware that ye have drunk
yourself within six months of the grave?

1097
01:31:52,875 --> 01:31:55,583
This morning, you had a warning
that any sane man would listen to...

1098
01:31:55,667 --> 01:31:57,583
and you're going to listen to it, sir.

1099
01:31:57,667 --> 01:32:00,500
- By taking your prescription.
- Precisely.

1100
01:32:00,583 --> 01:32:03,750
And you shall practice
total abstinence in the future.

1101
01:32:03,833 --> 01:32:09,458
Are you asking me to give up
my reasonable refreshment?

1102
01:32:09,542 --> 01:32:11,542
I forbid alcohol absolutely.

1103
01:32:11,625 --> 01:32:16,125
If I'm to be beaten by drink,
I'll die fightin'.

1104
01:32:16,250 --> 01:32:18,917
Life's got to be worth living
before I live it.

1105
01:32:19,042 --> 01:32:21,708
If that's the way you talk,
my services are no use to you.

1106
01:32:21,833 --> 01:32:25,333
<i>-  They're not,
and I'll pay you on the nail for this.
- I congratulate you on the impulse.</i>

1107
01:32:25,458 --> 01:32:27,333
<i>
Now listen-</i>

1108
01:32:28,792 --> 01:32:31,917
What are you doing under my roof?

1109
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:35,042
- I've come because I was fetched, Father.
- Who fetched you?

1110
01:32:35,167 --> 01:32:37,375
- Tubby Wadlow.
- Tubby can quit my shop this minute.

1111
01:32:37,500 --> 01:32:40,042
- Sit down, man.
- He said you were dangerously ill.

1112
01:32:40,167 --> 01:32:42,042
- He is, Mrs. -
- Mossop.

1113
01:32:42,167 --> 01:32:44,792
- Your father is drinking himself to death.
- Now look here, Doctor.

1114
01:32:44,875 --> 01:32:47,500
What's passed between you and me
isn't for everybody's ears.

1115
01:32:47,625 --> 01:32:49,542
Go on. I'd like to hear it all.

1116
01:32:49,667 --> 01:32:54,125
- Nasty-minded curiosity.
- I don't agree with you, Mr. Hobson.

1117
01:32:54,208 --> 01:32:56,792
You're a dunderheaded
lump of obstinacy...

1118
01:32:56,917 --> 01:33:00,875
but I have taken a fancy to you,
and I decline to let you kill yourself.

1119
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:03,917
Can I have a word with you
in private, please, Mrs. Mossop?

1120
01:33:04,042 --> 01:33:06,458
Thank you.

1121
01:33:06,583 --> 01:33:09,125
Good-bye, Mr. Hobson.

1122
01:33:09,250 --> 01:33:11,958
Oh, and a Happy New Year to you.

1123
01:34:09,375 --> 01:34:11,250
Well, out with it.

1124
01:34:11,375 --> 01:34:14,167
It seems you're not to be trusted
on your own anymore, Father.

1125
01:34:14,250 --> 01:34:16,458
Alice or Vicky will have to come
and look after you.

1126
01:34:16,583 --> 01:34:18,792
I paid £500 to get rid of them.

1127
01:34:19,958 --> 01:34:22,500
- What about you?
- It's out of the question.

1128
01:34:22,583 --> 01:34:24,500
Alice and Vicky
have got time on their hands.

1129
01:34:24,583 --> 01:34:26,792
Will and me have got a business to run.

1130
01:34:26,917 --> 01:34:28,875
I'm off now to see Alice and Vicky.

1131
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:31,375
We'll all be back here
later this afternoon.

1132
01:34:31,458 --> 01:34:33,958
And you'd better put a collar on
in case Will comes.

1133
01:34:34,083 --> 01:34:37,625
Put a collar on for Will Mossop?

1134
01:34:37,750 --> 01:34:41,958
I think you've lost
your sense of proportion, my girl.

1135
01:34:42,083 --> 01:34:44,833
I'll have him treated with respect.

1136
01:34:44,917 --> 01:34:46,875
I'll be back at 1:00.

1137
01:35:04,625 --> 01:35:07,708
And now I'm going back there
to get things tidied up.

1138
01:35:07,792 --> 01:35:09,958
You put your best coat on
and your new hat...

1139
01:35:10,083 --> 01:35:13,042
- and I shall expect you there at 1:00.
- Yes, Maggie.

1140
01:35:13,125 --> 01:35:15,958
And remember, you can take
a high hand with Alice and Vicky.

1141
01:35:16,042 --> 01:35:19,417
- Aye.
- And with Father and all.
He's not too ill to stand it.

1142
01:35:19,500 --> 01:35:23,000
I'm a bit short of practice at taking
a high hand with Mr. Hobson.

1143
01:35:23,125 --> 01:35:25,083
You can do it, love.

1144
01:35:26,167 --> 01:35:28,042
Aye.

1145
01:35:28,167 --> 01:35:30,125
I'll do you credit, lass.

1146
01:36:03,792 --> 01:36:05,750
Morning, Miss Alice.

1147
01:36:07,333 --> 01:36:09,333
You might have waited till after dark.

1148
01:36:09,458 --> 01:36:12,042
Darkness won't hide
what the whole street knows already.

1149
01:36:12,167 --> 01:36:16,167
I told you. It's a different place from
when we used to live here. Come in.

1150
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:44,875
Morning, Alice.
Morning, Vicky.

1151
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:46,875
- Where's Father?
- Upstairs.

1152
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:48,917
Well, go and bring him down
and look sharp.

1153
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:51,208
I'm busier at my shop
than what they are at his.

1154
01:36:51,333 --> 01:36:53,292
Yes, Willie.

1155
01:36:53,375 --> 01:36:57,542
Aye. It used to be a good business
in its day too, did Hobson's.

1156
01:36:57,667 --> 01:37:00,250
What on earth do you mean?
It's a good business still.

1157
01:37:00,375 --> 01:37:02,750
If you'd not married
into the law, Alice...

1158
01:37:02,833 --> 01:37:07,167
you'd realize what the value of your father's
business is today in trading circles.

1159
01:37:07,250 --> 01:37:10,000
Vicky ought to know.
Her husband's in trade.

1160
01:37:10,125 --> 01:37:12,917
- My Freddy in trade?
- Well, isn't he?

1161
01:37:13,000 --> 01:37:16,125
He's in the wholesale.
That's business, not trade.

1162
01:37:16,250 --> 01:37:19,542
And the value of Father's shop
is no concern of yours, Will Mossop.

1163
01:37:19,625 --> 01:37:21,667
What are you doing?

1164
01:37:21,750 --> 01:37:23,708
I'm looking over the stock.

1165
01:37:23,792 --> 01:37:26,792
If I'm to come into a thing,
I like to know what I'm coming into.

1166
01:37:26,917 --> 01:37:29,500
You're coming here
to look after Father.

1167
01:37:29,625 --> 01:37:32,375
Maggie can do that with one hand
tied behind her back.

1168
01:37:32,458 --> 01:37:34,375
I'll look after the business.

1169
01:37:34,500 --> 01:37:38,083
Will Mossop. Do you know
who you're talking to?

1170
01:37:38,167 --> 01:37:40,500
Aye. Me wife's young sisters.

1171
01:37:45,875 --> 01:37:48,542
- He's been drinking.
- Now listen, Alice. We got to be careful.

1172
01:37:48,667 --> 01:37:50,625
- What do you mean?
- Look-

1173
01:37:55,042 --> 01:37:57,875
Suppose Father gets worse
and they're here?

1174
01:37:57,958 --> 01:38:00,458
- Yes?
- Can't you see what I'm thinking?

1175
01:38:00,583 --> 01:38:02,458
Well, go on.

1176
01:38:02,583 --> 01:38:05,958
- It's so difficult to say.
- Well, say it.

1177
01:38:06,083 --> 01:38:08,458
He might leave them all his money.

1178
01:38:09,625 --> 01:38:12,125
<i>
Willie, Father's down.</i>

1179
01:38:12,208 --> 01:38:15,083
- Hello, Father.
- Alice.

1180
01:38:16,750 --> 01:38:18,667
Father, you're ill.

1181
01:38:18,750 --> 01:38:23,542
Vicky, my baby. Oh, it's nice to know
that I have daughters that care for me.

1182
01:38:23,667 --> 01:38:27,375
Of course we care.
Come and sit down, Father.

1183
01:38:27,500 --> 01:38:30,000
You're looking all right.
You've quite a color.

1184
01:38:30,125 --> 01:38:32,167
Now look here, Alice.
I'm very ill...

1185
01:38:32,292 --> 01:38:34,792
and I need someone to look after me.

1186
01:38:34,917 --> 01:38:39,458
- They know all about it, Father.
- Then which one is it to be?

1187
01:38:39,583 --> 01:38:43,083
- It can't be me in my circumstances.
- What circumstances?

1188
01:38:46,958 --> 01:38:48,958
What are you whispering about?

1189
01:38:50,292 --> 01:38:52,125
She's expecting.

1190
01:38:52,250 --> 01:38:55,458
But I don't see how that rules you out.
It could happen to any of us.

1191
01:38:55,583 --> 01:38:57,708
<i>-  Maggie!
-  Well, what's the matter?</i>

1192
01:38:57,833 --> 01:39:00,083
<i>It does happen to married women,
and we're all married.</i>

1193
01:39:00,167 --> 01:39:02,667
Well, I say it ought to be Maggie, Father.
She's the eldest.

1194
01:39:02,792 --> 01:39:06,625
- And I say you are -
- Morning, Father. I'm sorry to hear
you're not so well.

1195
01:39:06,708 --> 01:39:10,208
- I'm a changed man, Will.
- There used to be room for improvement.

1196
01:39:10,333 --> 01:39:12,667
- What?
- Sit down, Father.

1197
01:39:12,750 --> 01:39:16,000
<i>Aye. Well, don't let's be
too long about this.</i>

1198
01:39:16,083 --> 01:39:18,208
My time's valuable.
I'm busy at me shop.

1199
01:39:18,333 --> 01:39:22,250
Is your shop more important
than my life?

1200
01:39:22,333 --> 01:39:25,292
I'm worrited about your life
because it worrits Maggie.

1201
01:39:25,417 --> 01:39:28,667
But I'm none worrited that bad I'll see
my business suffer for the sake of you.

1202
01:39:28,792 --> 01:39:32,250
This is not what I've a right to expect
from you, Will.

1203
01:39:32,375 --> 01:39:35,750
You've no right to expect I care
whether you sink or swim.

1204
01:39:35,833 --> 01:39:37,542
- Oh!
- Will!

1205
01:39:37,667 --> 01:39:41,625
<i>And we're to stay here and watch Maggie
and Will abusing Father when he's ill?</i>

1206
01:39:41,708 --> 01:39:45,458
- There's no need for you to stay.
- That's a true word, Will Mossop.

1207
01:39:45,542 --> 01:39:49,417
<i>-  But, Father. Dear Father-
-  Are you willing to come?</i>

1208
01:39:49,542 --> 01:39:52,625
- No.
- Are you, Vicky?

1209
01:39:52,708 --> 01:39:56,333
- L-It's me child, Father.
- Never mind what it is!

1210
01:39:56,417 --> 01:39:59,125
- Are you for coming or not?
- No, I'm not.

1211
01:39:59,250 --> 01:40:01,417
Very well.

1212
01:40:01,542 --> 01:40:06,958
Those that aren't willing
can leave me to talk with them that are.

1213
01:40:09,125 --> 01:40:11,458
Show them the door, Will.

1214
01:40:15,625 --> 01:40:16,625
Vicky.

1215
01:40:17,875 --> 01:40:20,875
- Well, I don't know.
- We'll be pleased to see you teatime...

1216
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:23,333
any Sunday afternoon
if you'll condescend to come.

1217
01:40:23,458 --> 01:40:25,625
Huh! Beggars on horseback.

1218
01:40:33,625 --> 01:40:37,042
<i>
Now, my lad. I'll tell you what I'll do.</i>

1219
01:40:37,125 --> 01:40:39,042
<i>- Sit you down.
- Aye.</i>

1220
01:40:39,125 --> 01:40:41,708
We can come to grips better
now there are no fine ladies about.

1221
01:40:41,833 --> 01:40:43,750
They've got stiff necks with pride...

1222
01:40:43,833 --> 01:40:47,083
and the difference between you two
and them's a thing that I ought to mark...

1223
01:40:47,167 --> 01:40:49,083
and that I'm going to mark.

1224
01:40:49,167 --> 01:40:51,458
There's times for holding back,
and there's times...

1225
01:40:51,542 --> 01:40:53,500
for letting loose and being generous.

1226
01:40:53,583 --> 01:40:58,042
Now, you're coming here to this house,
both of you.

1227
01:40:58,167 --> 01:41:00,375
You'll have the back bedroom
for your own...

1228
01:41:00,500 --> 01:41:02,500
and the use of this room
split along with me.

1229
01:41:02,625 --> 01:41:05,833
Maggie'll keep house.
And if she's time, she can...

1230
01:41:05,958 --> 01:41:08,333
lend a hand in shop.

1231
01:41:08,458 --> 01:41:11,417
I'm finding Will a job.

1232
01:41:11,542 --> 01:41:13,625
You can have your old bench
back in cellar, Will...

1233
01:41:13,708 --> 01:41:15,625
and I'll pay you the old wage.

1234
01:41:15,708 --> 01:41:17,625
Eighteen shillings a week...

1235
01:41:17,750 --> 01:41:20,583
and you and me will go equal whacks
in the cost of the housekeeping.

1236
01:41:20,708 --> 01:41:23,125
And if that isn't handsome,
I don't know what is.

1237
01:41:26,792 --> 01:41:29,417
- Come on, Maggie.
- Aye. I think I'll have to.

1238
01:41:29,542 --> 01:41:31,458
Whatever's the hurry for?

1239
01:41:31,542 --> 01:41:34,958
It may be news to you, but I have
a business round in Oldfield Road...

1240
01:41:35,042 --> 01:41:37,625
and I'm neglecting it
by wasting me time here.

1241
01:41:37,750 --> 01:41:39,667
Wasting time?

1242
01:41:39,750 --> 01:41:42,042
Maggie, what's the matter with Will?
I've made him a proposal.

1243
01:41:42,167 --> 01:41:44,333
He has a shop of his own
to see to, Father.

1244
01:41:44,458 --> 01:41:46,875
A man who's having a job at Hobson's
doesn't have to worry...

1245
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:51,167
about a shop of his own in your
wretched cellar in Oldfield Road.

1246
01:41:51,250 --> 01:41:53,833
Shall I tell him, Maggie,
or shall we go?

1247
01:41:53,958 --> 01:41:58,708
- Go! I don't want to keep a man who -
- If Willie goes, Father, I go with him.

1248
01:41:59,750 --> 01:42:01,708
I think you'd better speak out, Will.

1249
01:42:01,792 --> 01:42:04,583
All right. I will.

1250
01:42:04,708 --> 01:42:06,708
We've been a year in yon
wretched cellar.

1251
01:42:06,833 --> 01:42:08,750
Do you know what we've done?

1252
01:42:08,833 --> 01:42:11,292
We've paid back Mrs. Hepworth
what she lent us for our start.

1253
01:42:11,375 --> 01:42:13,667
<i>- Mrs. Hepworth?
- Aye.</i>

1254
01:42:13,792 --> 01:42:16,000
And we've made a bit of brass
on top of that.

1255
01:42:16,125 --> 01:42:18,000
We've got your high-class trade
away from you.

1256
01:42:18,125 --> 01:42:21,042
Our shop's a cellar, but they come to us,
and they don't come to you.

1257
01:42:21,167 --> 01:42:23,125
Your trade's gone down
till all you sell is clogs.

1258
01:42:23,250 --> 01:42:25,500
<i>You've got no trade.
Me and Maggie's got it all.</i>

1259
01:42:25,583 --> 01:42:29,500
And all you think you can offer me
is me old job at 18 shillings a week?

1260
01:42:29,583 --> 01:42:32,042
Me, the owner of a business
that's starving yours to death?

1261
01:42:32,167 --> 01:42:34,667
But you're Will Mossop.

1262
01:42:34,750 --> 01:42:37,458
You're me old boot hand.

1263
01:42:37,583 --> 01:42:40,708
<i>Aye. I were.
But I've moved on a bit since then.</i>

1264
01:42:40,792 --> 01:42:43,625
Your daughter married me
and set about me education.

1265
01:42:43,750 --> 01:42:46,333
And, uh -
And now I'll tell you what I'll do.

1266
01:42:46,417 --> 01:42:50,458
<i>I'll transfer to this address,
and what I'll do that's generous is this:</i>

1267
01:42:50,583 --> 01:42:54,125
I'll take you into partnership
and give you your half share...

1268
01:42:54,250 --> 01:42:57,875
on the condition you're sleeping partner
and don't try interference on with me.

1269
01:42:59,542 --> 01:43:02,208
<i>- Partner?
- "William Mossop...</i>

1270
01:43:02,333 --> 01:43:04,458
late Hobson"
is the name this shop'll have.

1271
01:43:04,583 --> 01:43:06,958
Just a minute, Will.
I don't agree to that.

1272
01:43:07,042 --> 01:43:09,292
Oh, so you've piped up at last.

1273
01:43:09,375 --> 01:43:12,333
I began to think you'd both
lost your senses together.

1274
01:43:12,417 --> 01:43:15,917
It had better not be
"late Hobson," Will.

1275
01:43:16,042 --> 01:43:18,458
<i>- That's the way I want it, Maggie.
- Now, wait a bit.</i>

1276
01:43:18,583 --> 01:43:23,208
I'm to be given a half share
in me own business...

1277
01:43:23,292 --> 01:43:26,042
provided I take no part in running it?

1278
01:43:26,125 --> 01:43:28,625
Is that what you said?

1279
01:43:28,750 --> 01:43:31,000
- That's it.
- Well, I've heard of impudence before, but -

1280
01:43:31,125 --> 01:43:33,083
- It's all right, Father.
- Did you hear what he said?

1281
01:43:33,208 --> 01:43:35,250
Yes, Father. Yes.
But it's settled. Quite settled.

1282
01:43:35,375 --> 01:43:37,333
It's only the name
we're arguing about.

1283
01:43:39,042 --> 01:43:41,292
I won't have "late Hobson," Will.

1284
01:43:41,375 --> 01:43:45,042
I'm not dead yet, my lad,
and I'll show you that I'm not.

1285
01:43:45,167 --> 01:43:47,292
I think "Hobson and Mossop" is best.

1286
01:43:47,375 --> 01:43:50,167
<i>
His name on my signboard?</i>

1287
01:43:51,208 --> 01:43:53,125
The best I'll do is this:

1288
01:43:53,208 --> 01:43:55,125
"Mossop and Hobson."

1289
01:43:57,958 --> 01:43:59,917
No.

1290
01:44:00,042 --> 01:44:03,417
"Mossop and Hobson,"
or it's Oldfield Road for us, Maggie.

1291
01:44:10,875 --> 01:44:13,083
Very well, Will.

1292
01:44:13,167 --> 01:44:15,125
"Mossop and Hobson."

1293
01:44:16,208 --> 01:44:18,417
<i>- Now look here.
- Aye!</i>

1294
01:44:21,708 --> 01:44:25,125
I'll make some alteration
in this shop and all. I will so.

1295
01:44:25,208 --> 01:44:29,000
- Alterations in my shop!
- Look at that chair!

1296
01:44:29,125 --> 01:44:32,208
<i>How can you expect high-class
customers to sit on a chair like that?</i>

1297
01:44:32,333 --> 01:44:35,250
Why, we'd only a cellar,
but they did sit on cretonne.

1298
01:44:35,375 --> 01:44:38,542
Cretonne? It's pampering folk.

1299
01:44:38,667 --> 01:44:41,250
Cretonne for a cellar,
morocco for this shop.

1300
01:44:41,375 --> 01:44:43,417
Folks like to be pampered.
Pampering pays.

1301
01:44:43,542 --> 01:44:46,542
- We'll have carpet on that floor too.
- Carpet? Morocco?

1302
01:44:46,667 --> 01:44:51,542
Young man, do you think this shop
is in St. Ann's Square, Manchester?

1303
01:44:51,625 --> 01:44:53,833
Not yet.

1304
01:44:53,958 --> 01:44:56,208
But it's going to be.

1305
01:44:56,292 --> 01:44:59,250
It's no further from Chapel Street
to St. Ann's Square...

1306
01:44:59,333 --> 01:45:01,500
than it is from Oldfield Road
to Chapel Street.

1307
01:45:01,625 --> 01:45:05,292
<i>- I've done one jump in a year,
and if I wait a bit, I'll do tother.
- </i>

1308
01:45:08,458 --> 01:45:12,333
Give him time, Will.
It's come a bit sudden.

1309
01:45:12,417 --> 01:45:15,167
I'm afraid I bore on him too hard.

1310
01:45:15,292 --> 01:45:17,208
Did I sound confident, Maggie?

1311
01:45:17,292 --> 01:45:20,083
- You did all right.
- I weren't be half so certain as I sounded.

1312
01:45:20,208 --> 01:45:23,625
But you told me to be strong and use
the power that's come to me through you.

1313
01:45:23,750 --> 01:45:27,167
You know, words came to me mouth
that made me jump at me own boldness.

1314
01:45:27,250 --> 01:45:29,250
And when it came to facing you
about the name...

1315
01:45:29,375 --> 01:45:31,417
I tell you, I fair trembled in me shoes.

1316
01:45:31,500 --> 01:45:34,875
I was carried away like.
I'd not have dared to cross you, Maggie.

1317
01:45:35,000 --> 01:45:38,958
Don't spoil it, Will.
You're the man I made you, and I'm proud.

1318
01:45:39,000 --> 01:45:42,500
Yes, but-but I -
I said such things to him, and...

1319
01:45:42,583 --> 01:45:44,500
I sounded as if I meant them too.

1320
01:45:44,625 --> 01:45:46,917
- And didn't you?
- Aye. Aye. That's just the worst.

1321
01:45:47,000 --> 01:45:51,375
I mean, from me to him - I -
Uh, well, he-he's the old master, and -

1322
01:45:51,458 --> 01:45:53,583
And you're the new.

1323
01:46:02,375 --> 01:46:04,958
Will, what are you doing?
Leave my wedding ring alone.

1324
01:46:05,042 --> 01:46:08,500
- You've worn a brass one long enough.
- I'll wear that ring forever, Will.

1325
01:46:08,583 --> 01:46:11,083
But l-I was for getting you a proper one.

1326
01:46:11,167 --> 01:46:13,583
That brass stays where you put it, love.

1327
01:46:13,667 --> 01:46:15,583
And if ever we get
too rich and proud...

1328
01:46:15,667 --> 01:46:19,000
we'll just sit down together
and take a long look at it...

1329
01:46:19,125 --> 01:46:21,583
so as we'll not forget the truth
about ourselves.

1330
01:46:25,458 --> 01:46:27,667
I've come to a decision.

1331
01:46:27,792 --> 01:46:30,333
- Yes, Mr. Hobson?
- Will Mossop, you've forced me to it.

1332
01:46:30,458 --> 01:46:34,125
I never thought I'd have to stoop so low,
but I'm going round to see...

1333
01:46:34,250 --> 01:46:36,167
Albert Prosser.

1334
01:46:36,250 --> 01:46:38,375
- Albert Prosser?
- Aye.

1335
01:46:38,500 --> 01:46:41,417
I'm gonna fence you in
with the law.

1336
01:46:41,500 --> 01:46:46,708
Albert Prosser's going to draw up
a deed of partnership.

1337
01:46:46,833 --> 01:46:49,667
- Yes, Father.
- Aye.

1338
01:47:00,125 --> 01:47:02,833
Well, by gum!

1339
01:47:04,500 --> 01:47:06,917
By gum!

1340
01:47:07,000 --> 01:47:09,292
- Tubby, shop!

1341
01:47:10,500 --> 01:47:12,833
By gum!
