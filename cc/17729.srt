1
00:01:52,951 --> 00:01:54,385
Hello, Mr Kranz.

2
00:01:55,111 --> 00:01:58,259
- I'd like to redeem my...
- I know! The trombone.

3
00:01:58,476 --> 00:02:00,762
I always keep her hanging in the window

4
00:02:00,967 --> 00:02:04,269
so when you walk by
you can see she is still there.

5
00:02:04,373 --> 00:02:05,815
I keep my eyes on her.

6
00:02:05,949 --> 00:02:09,209
Say, Mr Miller,
where'd you got the money this time?

7
00:02:09,344 --> 00:02:13,821
- Working in a gas station.
- And now you've got another band job?

8
00:02:13,925 --> 00:02:18,452
Yep. I'm with Minton at the Sunset Hotel.
Chummy's gonna pick me up.

9
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:22,291
Your friend Chummy,
why don't he hock something?

10
00:02:22,395 --> 00:02:24,708
- He plays the piano.
- I see!

11
00:02:24,812 --> 00:02:30,135
That's all we need! To schlep a piano
in and out every once in a while.

12
00:02:30,235 --> 00:02:33,679
That string of pearls,
how much did you say that was?

13
00:02:33,784 --> 00:02:36,222
I'd like to give my girl a birthday present.

14
00:02:36,327 --> 00:02:38,311
Isn't it wonderful to be young?

15
00:02:38,415 --> 00:02:43,647
He just got his trombone out of hock
and he wants to buy a $100 necklace.

16
00:02:43,752 --> 00:02:45,485
$100?

17
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:48,656
I'd like to give her this.
Haven't seen her for a few years.

18
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:51,620
- You are engaged?
- No, not exactly.

19
00:02:51,724 --> 00:02:56,079
We went around together when we were
in college. University of Colorado.

20
00:02:56,184 --> 00:02:59,128
$100. That's a lot of money, isn't it?

21
00:02:59,232 --> 00:03:02,378
For a regular customer,
I make a special price.

22
00:03:02,483 --> 00:03:05,578
I guess that's Chummy.

23
00:03:06,378 --> 00:03:08,458
A hundred dollars.

24
00:03:11,134 --> 00:03:13,183
Here's for the horn.

25
00:03:13,288 --> 00:03:16,345
- Thanks. Goodbye.
- Goodbye, Mr Miller.

26
00:03:20,272 --> 00:03:24,451
- Where'd you get this one, Chummy?
- Made a deal on my Briscoe.

27
00:03:24,556 --> 00:03:27,913
She's a beaut.
45 horsepower. Only four years old.

28
00:03:28,017 --> 00:03:31,740
- 45 horse...
- Come on, hop in. We gotta get goin'

29
00:03:33,078 --> 00:03:35,920
- Isn't this a darb, kid?
- Yeah, gee whiz!

30
00:03:36,024 --> 00:03:39,137
- You bring my arrangement?
- You're sittin' on it.

31
00:03:39,241 --> 00:03:43,053
But this is the Sunset Hotel,
potted palms and marble stairs.

32
00:03:43,157 --> 00:03:45,975
- Minton's band plays sweet.
- I know that.

33
00:03:46,079 --> 00:03:49,729
Don't try to slip in
that arrangement of yours tonight.

34
00:03:49,833 --> 00:03:53,776
- We don't wanna lose this job.
- Stop worryin' This is a classic.

35
00:03:53,881 --> 00:03:57,198
I Dreamt I Dwelt In Marble Halls,
it's a classic!

36
00:03:57,302 --> 00:04:02,485
When Minton hears this arrangement,
he'll give us a job for life. Let's go.

37
00:04:51,218 --> 00:04:55,431
Too bad you can't keep the trombone
and hock the arrangement.

38
00:05:04,357 --> 00:05:06,908
- You know where there's Venice?
- Italy.

39
00:05:07,013 --> 00:05:10,540
No! Venice here.
By the pier, with that big wheel.

40
00:05:10,644 --> 00:05:14,002
- Oh, yeah.
- You boys go out there next Monday.

41
00:05:14,107 --> 00:05:17,550
- This fellow Pollack, he has tryouts.
- Ben Pollack?

42
00:05:17,655 --> 00:05:21,261
Ben Pollack. He gets together a new band.

43
00:05:21,365 --> 00:05:23,515
They go for a long, long trip.

44
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:26,645
- How do you know?
- A fellow told me this morning.

45
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:29,526
- You boys go out there.
- Sure. Thanks a lot.

46
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:30,943
Next Monday?

47
00:05:31,048 --> 00:05:33,566
That gives you a week
to get your trombone out.

48
00:05:33,671 --> 00:05:36,573
- You could work in a gas station.
- Not me.

49
00:05:36,677 --> 00:05:38,744
I'm gonna work on arrangements.

50
00:05:38,848 --> 00:05:42,871
For me, I'm glad for your business,
Mr Miller,

51
00:05:42,975 --> 00:05:47,381
but why don't you give up this arranging
and stick with the trombone?

52
00:05:47,485 --> 00:05:50,590
That's a good question.
I wish I knew the answer.

53
00:05:50,694 --> 00:05:54,553
But I have one idea up here in my head.

54
00:05:54,658 --> 00:05:58,101
To me, music is more
than just one instrument.

55
00:05:58,206 --> 00:06:01,020
It's a whole orchestra playing together. See?

56
00:06:01,124 --> 00:06:05,022
The only way I can express myself
is to work out an arrangement.

57
00:06:05,127 --> 00:06:07,904
See? Thanks for the tip.

58
00:06:08,008 --> 00:06:10,268
Come on.

59
00:07:03,631 --> 00:07:05,644
Great!

60
00:07:05,749 --> 00:07:09,022
- Thanks, Ben.
- You're in. You're in.

61
00:07:09,126 --> 00:07:11,174
- Who's next?
- I am.

62
00:07:12,224 --> 00:07:14,406
I've done some arrangements...

63
00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:17,282
I'm full up on arrangements.
I need more musicians.

64
00:07:17,387 --> 00:07:21,077
I've been working on 'em all week.
They're in your style.

65
00:07:21,181 --> 00:07:25,042
I appreciate that. Lay them on the piano,
I'll try 'em some other time.

66
00:07:25,146 --> 00:07:27,026
Uh-huh.

67
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:31,508
- My name's on the cover.
- Swell.

68
00:07:31,612 --> 00:07:33,263
OK, who's next?

69
00:07:33,367 --> 00:07:36,555
I am. My name's Schwartz.
Wilbur Schwartz.

70
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:40,307
Clarinet, eh? Sit down at the first chair
and blow a little bit.

71
00:07:40,412 --> 00:07:45,105
- What tune do you want me to play?
- Do you read at sight?

72
00:07:45,209 --> 00:07:48,435
- Try me.
- Chummy, get him something to read.

73
00:08:05,124 --> 00:08:07,199
One, two.

74
00:08:53,477 --> 00:08:57,575
Hey, Glenn! Come on back.
Mr Pollack wants to talk to you.

75
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:01,695
He says your arrangement is a pip!
Your arrangement!

76
00:09:03,069 --> 00:09:05,832
I'm playing in the band
and working on arrangements.

77
00:09:05,936 --> 00:09:07,627
I got a two-week advance.

78
00:09:07,732 --> 00:09:09,751
You are a regular Rockefeller!

79
00:09:09,855 --> 00:09:14,345
- I want to thank you for everything.
- Don't mention about it.

80
00:09:14,450 --> 00:09:17,392
I'm only glad it worked so good out.

81
00:09:17,496 --> 00:09:20,726
About that string of pearls
for my girl's birthday.

82
00:09:20,829 --> 00:09:25,106
You said something
about a special price for those.

83
00:09:25,210 --> 00:09:29,986
For you it's $80.
You pay me 40 down and $5 a week.

84
00:09:30,090 --> 00:09:32,447
- Good enough.
- Shall I mail it for you?

85
00:09:32,552 --> 00:09:35,581
I better take 'em with me.
I'm not sure of her address.

86
00:09:35,686 --> 00:09:38,996
We're booked into Denver.
She lives right near there.

87
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:42,213
Ten, 20, 30, 40.
There's the 40.

88
00:09:42,317 --> 00:09:46,552
- And here is for the trombone.
- All right.

89
00:09:46,656 --> 00:09:50,182
- Thank you very much.
- Same to you, and good luck.

90
00:09:50,287 --> 00:09:53,228
I hope you stay out
of pawnshops for a while.

91
00:09:53,332 --> 00:09:56,634
- So do I! Goodbye.
- Goodbye, Mr Miller.

92
00:10:05,567 --> 00:10:07,828
- Glenn, come on!
- A Pierce-Arrow?

93
00:10:07,932 --> 00:10:10,875
Yeah! I got it for the old car and 100 bucks.

94
00:10:10,979 --> 00:10:14,004
Much heavier.
It'll hold the road better on a long trip.

95
00:10:14,109 --> 00:10:17,212
If the band folds up,
we can sell it to an undertaker.

96
00:10:17,316 --> 00:10:20,291
Get in the back, I'll give you a ride in style.

97
00:10:40,483 --> 00:10:43,663
Hurry, Glenn. We're due
at the Denver Palace in ten minutes.

98
00:10:43,768 --> 00:10:46,577
- How much, sir?
- Oh, give us five.

99
00:10:59,422 --> 00:11:02,381
Hello. I want Boulder 6-1-7-0.

100
00:11:04,557 --> 00:11:06,633
How many?

101
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:17,812
I'll get it, Mother.

102
00:11:22,034 --> 00:11:23,335
Hello?

103
00:11:23,439 --> 00:11:26,534
Hello? Helen? How's my girl?

104
00:11:27,377 --> 00:11:29,385
Your girl? Who is this?

105
00:11:29,490 --> 00:11:31,802
Who is this? Is this Helen Burger?

106
00:11:31,906 --> 00:11:33,561
Yes, but there must be some...

107
00:11:33,665 --> 00:11:37,764
- Well, it's Glenn!
- Glenn? Glenn who?

108
00:11:38,766 --> 00:11:40,527
It's Glenn Miller!

109
00:11:40,631 --> 00:11:43,027
Glenn Miller?

110
00:11:43,131 --> 00:11:45,450
Oh, Glenn Miller.

111
00:11:45,551 --> 00:11:49,284
Well, now, honestly.
After two years and not a word.

112
00:11:49,388 --> 00:11:51,040
Didn't you get my card?

113
00:11:51,145 --> 00:11:53,329
The one you wrote
a year ago last Christmas?

114
00:11:53,434 --> 00:11:55,875
Well, I haven't heard from you either.

115
00:11:55,980 --> 00:12:00,424
I didn't know where you were.
I don't even know where you are now.

116
00:12:00,529 --> 00:12:04,850
I'm down here in Denver.
I want to see you. How about tonight?

117
00:12:04,954 --> 00:12:07,140
Oh, I'm sorry. I have a date.

118
00:12:07,245 --> 00:12:10,853
Couldn't you break it?
I'm with Pollack and we're leavin' tomorrow.

119
00:12:10,958 --> 00:12:12,775
Now, honestly, I...

120
00:12:12,879 --> 00:12:15,656
Glenn, come on, hurry it up.

121
00:12:15,761 --> 00:12:19,033
I'll see you later, then.
Gee, there's a lot I want to tell you.

122
00:12:19,137 --> 00:12:23,852
- Glenn, wait a minute...
- I'll be out right after I finish work. Bye.

123
00:12:24,991 --> 00:12:27,066
Glenn? Hello?

124
00:12:30,244 --> 00:12:32,403
Well, honestly.

125
00:12:39,383 --> 00:12:42,475
- Hi, Dad.
- Going out, Helen?

126
00:12:42,579 --> 00:12:45,526
This is a new wrinkle, isn't it?
Ed keeping you waiting.

127
00:12:45,627 --> 00:12:48,693
It isn't Ed tonight.
It's a man I haven't seen for years.

128
00:12:48,798 --> 00:12:50,864
Not Ed? What's happened?

129
00:12:50,969 --> 00:12:53,487
It must be serious for you
to break a date with Ed.

130
00:12:53,591 --> 00:12:56,373
No, Mother. Glenn isn't my type.

131
00:12:56,478 --> 00:13:00,748
I guess I'm just too practical
or unromantic or something.

132
00:13:00,852 --> 00:13:07,131
I want a man like Ed who's got a factory
or a store or something solid.

133
00:13:07,236 --> 00:13:10,596
I certainly don't want
a wandering nomad like Glenn Miller.

134
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:13,130
What's he do, this Glenn Miller?

135
00:13:13,802 --> 00:13:17,604
I don't really know except he said
he was in Denver for overnight.

136
00:13:17,709 --> 00:13:19,811
He's gonna pick me up after work.

137
00:13:19,916 --> 00:13:24,527
He must be a hard worker.
It's nearly 9:00 now.

138
00:13:24,632 --> 00:13:27,365
It is?

139
00:13:27,469 --> 00:13:29,519
Well.

140
00:13:38,164 --> 00:13:41,385
Oh! There's really no excuse for this!

141
00:13:41,489 --> 00:13:43,507
The least he could've done was phone.

142
00:13:43,611 --> 00:13:46,224
- Unless he was in an accident.
- Call him.

143
00:13:46,328 --> 00:13:48,349
How can I? I don't know where he is.

144
00:13:48,453 --> 00:13:51,482
If I'm going hunting in the morning,
I've gotta get to bed.

145
00:13:51,587 --> 00:13:54,171
Sam's picking me up at the crack of dawn.

146
00:13:54,276 --> 00:13:57,903
- Doesn't look as if he's coming tonight.
- It certainly doesn't!

147
00:13:58,007 --> 00:14:00,242
Even if he did come, I wouldn't see him.

148
00:14:00,346 --> 00:14:02,575
Then we can all go to bed?

149
00:14:02,679 --> 00:14:06,540
Well, so much for Mr Glenn Miller.

150
00:14:06,644 --> 00:14:08,693
I'll never see him again.

151
00:14:23,469 --> 00:14:25,549
Helen?

152
00:14:26,976 --> 00:14:29,726
Helen?

153
00:14:33,399 --> 00:14:34,776
Helen?

154
00:14:40,991 --> 00:14:42,615
Helen!

155
00:14:45,373 --> 00:14:48,208
Helen!

156
00:14:51,966 --> 00:14:54,885
- Oh, there you are.
- Glenn Miller, you go away.

157
00:14:55,593 --> 00:14:59,106
I don't want to go away.
I came to see you. We have a date.

158
00:14:59,205 --> 00:15:04,225
- Shh! You'll wake up the neighbourhood.
- How can I talk to you?

159
00:15:05,648 --> 00:15:07,971
You keep quiet. I'll be right down.

160
00:15:29,717 --> 00:15:31,228
Hello, Helen.

161
00:15:31,333 --> 00:15:33,941
What's the matter with you,
coming at this hour?

162
00:15:34,045 --> 00:15:37,940
I told you I'd come out after work.
I got here as quick as I could.

163
00:15:38,045 --> 00:15:42,119
- Shh. Be quiet.
- You haven't changed a bit, have you?

164
00:15:42,223 --> 00:15:45,949
Just as feisty as ever, and just as pretty too.

165
00:15:46,054 --> 00:15:50,462
I must be pretty! Wearing this kimono
and my hair up in curlers.

166
00:15:50,566 --> 00:15:52,877
Is that what they are? Come on, sit down.

167
00:15:52,982 --> 00:15:56,511
- It's cold out here.
- Come on. It's a beautiful night.

168
00:15:56,615 --> 00:15:57,841
Gee.

169
00:15:57,946 --> 00:16:02,474
There. I bought you a present
for your birthday.

170
00:16:02,578 --> 00:16:06,308
My birthday?
That isn't until next November.

171
00:16:06,413 --> 00:16:08,464
This is for your last birthday.

172
00:16:11,603 --> 00:16:15,326
Why, they're beautiful!
But I can't accept a present like this.

173
00:16:15,431 --> 00:16:18,742
Why not? They're not real.
I wish they were.

174
00:16:18,846 --> 00:16:23,168
I got 'em out in Los Angeles in a pa...
In a, uh... A, uh...

175
00:16:23,273 --> 00:16:25,735
I'll get you some real ones someday.

176
00:16:26,872 --> 00:16:28,303
Honestly.

177
00:16:28,407 --> 00:16:32,177
Two years and not a word
and then a present like this.

178
00:16:32,281 --> 00:16:37,103
You know, with some people
you don't have to write. You just know.

179
00:16:37,207 --> 00:16:40,397
- I knew you'd be here.
- Oh, you did?

180
00:16:40,501 --> 00:16:43,733
Sure. I knew you'd be just the same.

181
00:16:43,837 --> 00:16:46,903
Just sitting around waiting
for you to show up, I suppose?

182
00:16:47,007 --> 00:16:50,784
"How is my girl?" you said.
Well, you happen to be wrong!

183
00:16:50,889 --> 00:16:53,915
I've been engaged to Ed Healey
for nearly a year.

184
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:57,416
Did it occur to you that I might not care
if I ever saw you again?

185
00:16:57,518 --> 00:16:59,628
No, it never did.

186
00:16:59,733 --> 00:17:01,673
Never.

187
00:17:01,777 --> 00:17:04,928
- Never.
- Why can't I ever stay mad at you?

188
00:17:05,033 --> 00:17:07,727
You had me worried there for a minute.

189
00:17:07,831 --> 00:17:10,143
Honestly!

190
00:17:10,247 --> 00:17:14,937
If you were anybody else,
I would never speak to you again.

191
00:17:15,041 --> 00:17:19,569
Look at me. Sitting here
in this kimono and my hair all...

192
00:17:19,673 --> 00:17:22,319
- Those curlers.
- Terrible, isn't it?

193
00:17:23,817 --> 00:17:27,540
Helen, now look, I've got an idea.

194
00:17:27,645 --> 00:17:31,532
Come with me to Fort Morgan.
I'm gonna introduce you to my folks.

195
00:17:32,165 --> 00:17:34,258
- Now?
- Right now.

196
00:17:34,363 --> 00:17:36,844
People do sleep between 3am and 6am.

197
00:17:36,948 --> 00:17:39,383
They'll be crazy about you.

198
00:17:39,488 --> 00:17:42,517
- And they'll give us breakfast.
- How do we get there?

199
00:17:42,622 --> 00:17:45,102
- I'll get a taxi.
- A taxi to Fort Morgan?

200
00:17:45,207 --> 00:17:47,440
- Sure.
- That's so extravagant.

201
00:17:47,546 --> 00:17:50,192
- It isn't far.
- Maybe I can get the family car.

202
00:17:50,297 --> 00:17:52,319
Wonderful. Wait a minute.

203
00:17:52,424 --> 00:17:54,604
Let me try these on for size, hm?

204
00:17:55,986 --> 00:17:57,026
There.

205
00:18:00,781 --> 00:18:01,954
Uh-oh.

206
00:18:02,059 --> 00:18:04,582
- Mr Burger, I...
- Take it easy, son.

207
00:18:04,687 --> 00:18:07,617
I'm just going hunting, for jackrabbits.

208
00:18:24,812 --> 00:18:27,358
- Glenn!
- It's Glenn!

209
00:18:27,463 --> 00:18:30,951
Hi, Herb. How are you?
Glad to see you. Hello, Irene.

210
00:18:31,056 --> 00:18:34,036
- What a surprise! I had no idea.
- Hello, Mother.

211
00:18:34,141 --> 00:18:36,166
Glad to see you. Mother, this is...

212
00:18:36,270 --> 00:18:38,965
You don't need to tell me. You're Helen!

213
00:18:39,069 --> 00:18:41,546
We've been hearing about you for years.

214
00:18:41,651 --> 00:18:44,005
Why, yes. I'm very happy to meet you.

215
00:18:44,109 --> 00:18:47,179
- Daddy'll be down in a minute.
- Dean and Velna?

216
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:49,974
They're fine! I'll show you
a picture of the baby.

217
00:18:50,079 --> 00:18:52,976
- Sure.
- She your girl, Glenn?

218
00:18:53,082 --> 00:18:54,773
That's right, Herb.

219
00:18:54,878 --> 00:18:57,066
Are you and Glenn gonna get married?

220
00:18:57,170 --> 00:19:00,404
Don't ask that!
We just take such things for granted.

221
00:19:00,508 --> 00:19:02,612
- How are you, son?
- Fine.

222
00:19:02,717 --> 00:19:05,829
- And you're Helen. Welcome to the family.
- Thank you.

223
00:19:05,933 --> 00:19:09,874
- You gonna get these kids some breakfast?
- I certainly am!

224
00:19:09,979 --> 00:19:13,840
You might've let us know where you are
and what your plans are.

225
00:19:13,945 --> 00:19:16,971
We have to ask Helen, eh?
I'll bet he tells you everything.

226
00:19:17,076 --> 00:19:20,433
Oh, no, Mr Miller.
I seem to be the last person he tells.

227
00:19:20,537 --> 00:19:23,183
- Yeah.
- Well, come on.

228
00:19:23,287 --> 00:19:25,353
- You like hotcakes, Helen?
- Yes.

229
00:19:25,457 --> 00:19:27,303
Mom makes pretty good ones...

230
00:19:28,142 --> 00:19:29,653
~ <i> Little brown jug, how I love thee</i> ~

231
00:19:29,757 --> 00:19:32,190
~ <i> Ha-ha-ha, you and me</i> ~

232
00:19:32,294 --> 00:19:36,899
~ <i> Little brown jug, how I love thee...</i> ~

233
00:19:39,862 --> 00:19:42,705
Good old Colorado U.
It hasn't changed a bit.

234
00:19:42,809 --> 00:19:45,334
No, it's just as pretty as ever.

235
00:19:45,439 --> 00:19:49,217
We still have time. Let's walk
across the campus for old times' sake.

236
00:19:49,322 --> 00:19:51,371
- I'd love to.
- Come on.

237
00:19:53,379 --> 00:19:56,665
- Wish I didn't have to leave so soon.
- I do too.

238
00:19:57,843 --> 00:20:00,468
Listen. It's the Glee Club rehearsing.

239
00:20:01,599 --> 00:20:04,736
- I love that song.
- What, Little Brown Jug?

240
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:07,569
That's sort of a tin-eared tune.

241
00:20:07,674 --> 00:20:10,114
Why, that's one of my favourites.

242
00:20:10,219 --> 00:20:14,374
My dad used to sing it to me
when I was a little girl. I guess that's why.

243
00:20:14,478 --> 00:20:16,856
- They sing it pretty well.
- Mm-hm.

244
00:20:18,455 --> 00:20:21,592
When something's
really wonderful like that, I know it.

245
00:20:21,696 --> 00:20:25,134
I get kind of a funny feeling
up the back of my neck.

246
00:20:25,239 --> 00:20:29,013
That's how I can tell.
Sort of makes my hair stand on end.

247
00:20:29,118 --> 00:20:31,390
- Is that so?
- Yeah.

248
00:20:31,494 --> 00:20:33,979
Looks pretty normal from here.

249
00:20:34,084 --> 00:20:36,132
It just feels that way!

250
00:20:36,977 --> 00:20:39,429
- Remember that lake?
- Yes, I do.

251
00:20:44,235 --> 00:20:46,955
- Where do you go from here?
- We're heading east.

252
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:50,418
Chicago, New York.
We're booked into the Club Fifty there.

253
00:20:50,522 --> 00:20:52,375
- Ever been to New York?
- No.

254
00:20:52,479 --> 00:20:54,879
Neither have I. I hear it's quite a town.

255
00:20:54,983 --> 00:20:57,825
You're certainly seeing America, aren't you?

256
00:20:58,877 --> 00:21:01,222
You think I'm kinda rudderless, don't you?

257
00:21:01,326 --> 00:21:04,390
Wandering over the country with the band.

258
00:21:04,494 --> 00:21:07,311
- Yes, I guess I do.
- But I'm not, though.

259
00:21:07,415 --> 00:21:12,570
I know exactly where I'm going.
I know exactly what I want to do.

260
00:21:12,674 --> 00:21:14,072
You do?

261
00:21:14,178 --> 00:21:17,948
I'm not gonna be a sideman all my life,
a trombone player.

262
00:21:18,052 --> 00:21:20,408
I'm gonna have a band all of my own.

263
00:21:20,513 --> 00:21:23,416
I'm gonna play my own kind of music.

264
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:27,878
I... It's hard to explain, but a band...

265
00:21:27,983 --> 00:21:32,585
A band oughta have a sound all of its own,
oughta have a personality.

266
00:21:33,543 --> 00:21:36,187
- Sort of like a person.
- Uh-huh.

267
00:21:36,291 --> 00:21:38,723
How do you get this different sound?

268
00:21:38,828 --> 00:21:41,398
You see, the arrangements,

269
00:21:41,502 --> 00:21:44,813
the way you score each one
of the individual instruments.

270
00:21:44,919 --> 00:21:47,819
Some bands have that sound already,
like Pollack,

271
00:21:47,923 --> 00:21:50,576
but it's not the right sound, not for me.

272
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:53,576
- What is?
- I don't know.

273
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:56,374
I don't know. I haven't found it yet.

274
00:21:56,479 --> 00:21:59,957
But someday I'm gonna find it
and when I do...

275
00:22:00,062 --> 00:22:02,410
You'll find it. I'm sure you will.

276
00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:06,922
- You are?
- Hey, Glenn!

277
00:22:08,464 --> 00:22:11,434
There's Chummy.
He found it all right. Goodbye.

278
00:22:11,538 --> 00:22:15,185
It's been wonderful seeing you. Goodbye.
I'm comin'

279
00:22:15,289 --> 00:22:18,184
You'll be hearing from me. Wait and see.

280
00:22:21,563 --> 00:22:24,729
- Come on, boy, let's go.
- All right, all right.

281
00:22:28,242 --> 00:22:29,519
Bye.

282
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:40,119
Honestly.

283
00:23:12,962 --> 00:23:15,091
How about one more?
One more number?

284
00:23:15,196 --> 00:23:18,477
We can't, kids.
We're leaving for Atlantic City.

285
00:23:18,582 --> 00:23:20,646
We'll be back in a couple of months.

286
00:23:20,751 --> 00:23:22,603
Thanks a lot. Swell.

287
00:23:22,708 --> 00:23:26,275
Fellas, listen just a minute
before you start packing up.

288
00:23:26,379 --> 00:23:31,320
The bus leaves from the hotel for
Atlantic City tomorrow morning at 10:30.

289
00:23:31,424 --> 00:23:35,979
Everybody be on time.
Don't be late, will ya? OK.

290
00:23:37,325 --> 00:23:41,043
Ben, like I told you,

291
00:23:41,148 --> 00:23:43,758
I guess this is where I get off.

292
00:23:43,862 --> 00:23:46,093
I want to thank you for everything.

293
00:23:46,197 --> 00:23:48,428
- You know what you're doin'
- Yeah.

294
00:23:48,532 --> 00:23:52,724
I wanna stick around New York for a while.
I want to do some studying.

295
00:23:52,829 --> 00:23:56,061
Just when the band's
really startin' to take on.

296
00:23:56,166 --> 00:23:59,648
I know all that. I appreciate
everything you've done for me

297
00:23:59,752 --> 00:24:02,698
and I wish you all the luck in the world.

298
00:24:02,802 --> 00:24:08,662
If there's... Any time you want me to do
an arrangement for you, just let me know.

299
00:24:08,767 --> 00:24:12,499
That's an idea.
Well, so long, kid. A lotta luck.

300
00:24:12,603 --> 00:24:15,004
- Thanks for everything.
- Goodbye.

301
00:24:15,108 --> 00:24:17,756
- You're really serious about this?
- Yeah.

302
00:24:17,859 --> 00:24:21,286
Still got that crazy idea in your head,
that sound?

303
00:24:23,256 --> 00:24:25,638
Hey, Don?

304
00:24:25,742 --> 00:24:28,397
This is Chummy MacGregor.
This is Don Haynes.

305
00:24:28,501 --> 00:24:31,443
- Hi.
- Glad to meet ya. You're the band booker.

306
00:24:31,548 --> 00:24:33,901
Gonna try and get Glenn
some work arranging.

307
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,276
- It's an awful lonely town.
- I know.

308
00:24:36,380 --> 00:24:40,455
I wish we could stick together,
but I've been eating for two years now.

309
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:43,457
It's gotten to be a habit.
I don't think I can break it.

310
00:24:43,561 --> 00:24:45,664
I know.

311
00:24:45,769 --> 00:24:49,002
Well, good luck, kid.
Hope you find a friendly pawn shop.

312
00:24:49,107 --> 00:24:51,370
- Yeah, bye, Chummy.
- So long.

313
00:25:43,734 --> 00:25:46,454
- Glenn!
- Hi, Don. How are you?

314
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:48,453
- What are you doin'
- Not much.

315
00:25:48,558 --> 00:25:53,541
Listen, Red Nichols is getting together
a pit band for a new musical, Girl Crazy.

316
00:25:53,646 --> 00:25:56,630
I know you're still looking for
that sound but it's been two years.

317
00:25:56,734 --> 00:25:59,926
- You won't find it on an empty stomach.
- I sure can't.

318
00:26:00,030 --> 00:26:03,510
A lot of your friends are in the band -
Benny Goodman, Babe Russin.

319
00:26:03,614 --> 00:26:07,856
- It's a great chance. It'll run all season.
- I guess I better take it.

320
00:26:07,956 --> 00:26:10,188
I'll call you tomorrow. I gotta run.

321
00:26:10,292 --> 00:26:12,341
Thanks a lot.

322
00:26:29,912 --> 00:26:33,801
~ <i> My wife and I live all alone</i>
<i>in a little log hut we call our own</i> ~

323
00:26:33,905 --> 00:26:37,638
~ <i> She loves gin and I love rum,</i>
<i>I tell you, we have lots of fun</i> ~

324
00:26:37,743 --> 00:26:41,217
~ <i> Ha-ha-ha, you and me,</i>
<i>little brown jug, don't I love thee?</i> ~

325
00:26:41,719 --> 00:26:45,424
~ <i> Ha-ha-ha, you and me,</i>
<i>little brown jug, don't I love thee?</i> ~

326
00:26:52,401 --> 00:26:55,993
~ <i>If I'd a cow that gave such milk,</i>
<i>I'd clothe her in the finest silk</i> ~

327
00:26:56,097 --> 00:26:59,711
~ <i> I'd feed her on the choicest hay</i>
<i>and milk her forty times a day</i> ~

328
00:26:59,815 --> 00:27:03,629
~ <i> Ha-ha-ha, you and me,</i>
<i>little brown jug, don't I love thee?</i> ~

329
00:27:03,734 --> 00:27:07,540
~ <i> Ha-ha-ha, you and me,</i>
<i>little brown jug, don't I love thee?</i> ~

330
00:27:07,879 --> 00:27:09,836
Helen, it's for you.

331
00:27:10,966 --> 00:27:14,021
- Who is it?
- Don't forget to turn off the roast.

332
00:27:14,126 --> 00:27:16,770
Who is it?

333
00:27:16,875 --> 00:27:18,102
Hello.

334
00:27:18,206 --> 00:27:20,527
Helen, can you come
to New York right away?

335
00:27:20,632 --> 00:27:24,572
Glenn! I don't know whether I can or not.

336
00:27:24,676 --> 00:27:26,578
But for heaven's sake, why?

337
00:27:26,682 --> 00:27:28,699
So we can get married.

338
00:27:28,803 --> 00:27:31,124
I need you, Helen. I can't wait any longer.

339
00:27:31,228 --> 00:27:33,166
Glenn, I'm engaged!

340
00:27:33,271 --> 00:27:36,917
That's right. It'll be a very short engagement.

341
00:27:37,022 --> 00:27:41,011
No, you don't understand.
I'm engaged to Ed. Ed Healey.

342
00:27:41,116 --> 00:27:44,388
Ed Healey? The fellow
you told me about two years ago?

343
00:27:44,493 --> 00:27:48,389
- Yes.
- If you haven't gotten married in two years...

344
00:27:48,493 --> 00:27:51,692
People just don't rush into getting married!

345
00:27:51,797 --> 00:27:56,863
Nonsense, Helen. You come to New York,
marry me and get this thing settled.

346
00:27:56,966 --> 00:27:59,237
I can't just walk out on him!

347
00:27:59,341 --> 00:28:03,995
There's a train leaving Denver
at 11:30 tomorrow night. Can you get that?

348
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:05,953
Glenn, you just wait a minute.

349
00:28:06,058 --> 00:28:09,119
We can talk everything over
when you get here.

350
00:28:10,420 --> 00:28:12,141
Honestly!

351
00:28:12,365 --> 00:28:16,931
Call me from Denver so I can meet the train.
My number is Pennsylvania 6-5000.

352
00:28:17,035 --> 00:28:19,137
Pennsylvania 6-5000.

353
00:28:19,241 --> 00:28:21,767
Pennsylvania 6-5-0-0-0.

354
00:28:21,872 --> 00:28:24,649
And, Helen, bring a warm coat.

355
00:28:24,753 --> 00:28:27,778
It gets kinda chilly here
this time of year. Goodbye.

356
00:28:27,882 --> 00:28:29,230
Glenn!

357
00:28:53,842 --> 00:28:57,676
What beats me is how she got Ed
to drive her into Denver.

358
00:29:06,401 --> 00:29:08,700
Helen!

359
00:29:08,804 --> 00:29:12,830
- Hi. You look wonderful.
- I've only come to talk things over.

360
00:29:12,934 --> 00:29:15,170
We can talk it over on the way.

361
00:29:15,274 --> 00:29:18,797
I'm not going to let you
rush me into getting married.

362
00:29:18,902 --> 00:29:21,885
Of course not.
But there isn't much time.

363
00:29:21,989 --> 00:29:27,434
We have to pick up the licence,
then be uptown at the church by 7:00.

364
00:29:27,539 --> 00:29:31,314
- I have to be in the theatre by eight.
- Wait a minute, Glenn.

365
00:29:31,418 --> 00:29:34,226
Gee, I'm so glad you're here.

366
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:02,395
- Where are we going?
- The theatre.

367
00:30:02,499 --> 00:30:06,443
You're gonna see a wonderful show,
Girl Crazy. I got you a box seat.

368
00:30:06,545 --> 00:30:09,611
- No, I mean, on our honeymoon.
- The Pennsylvania Hotel.

369
00:30:09,716 --> 00:30:13,740
Don's arranged for a big suite.
He's sending up the baggage.

370
00:30:13,845 --> 00:30:16,872
The Pennsylvania Hotel?
Isn't that extravagant?

371
00:30:16,977 --> 00:30:21,248
If we'd been married in Boulder
and come to New York on our honeymoon,

372
00:30:21,353 --> 00:30:23,255
we'd be staying at a hotel.

373
00:30:23,359 --> 00:30:27,382
- I suppose.
- Of course we would. Here's the ticket.

374
00:30:27,486 --> 00:30:31,043
I'll meet you after the show.
I wanna check if it's...

375
00:30:33,092 --> 00:30:37,384
- What? What are you looking at?
- The man I just married.

376
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:44,240
The first time I even suspected anything
was when I found myself packing.

377
00:30:44,345 --> 00:30:47,866
And then when you met me
at the station and kissed me.

378
00:30:47,970 --> 00:30:49,992
It was that kiss that convinced you.

379
00:30:50,097 --> 00:30:52,667
I kinda figured that'd do the trick.

380
00:30:52,770 --> 00:30:56,868
And if you don't mind,
I'd like to be convinced all over again.

381
00:30:59,206 --> 00:31:03,469
~ <i> I'm bidin' my time</i> ~

382
00:31:03,573 --> 00:31:07,759
~ <i> Cos that's the kind of guy I'm</i> ~

383
00:31:08,387 --> 00:31:12,437
~ <i> Beginnin' on a Monday,</i>
<i>right through Sunday</i> ~

384
00:31:12,541 --> 00:31:17,110
~ <i> Bidin' my time</i> ~

385
00:31:17,216 --> 00:31:20,274
~ <i> Next year</i> ~

386
00:31:26,452 --> 00:31:28,409
~ <i> This year</i> ~

387
00:31:35,421 --> 00:31:39,515
~ <i> I'm bidin' my time</i> ~

388
00:31:39,619 --> 00:31:44,143
~ <i> Cos that's the kind of guy I'm</i> ~

389
00:31:44,247 --> 00:31:46,568
~ <i> Stranger, so long</i> ~

390
00:31:46,672 --> 00:31:48,817
~ <i> I'll just go 'long</i> ~

391
00:31:48,922 --> 00:31:53,282
~ <i> Bidin', bidin'</i> ~

392
00:31:53,387 --> 00:31:58,069
~ <i> Bidin' my time</i> ~

393
00:32:13,551 --> 00:32:15,261
Sixth floor.

394
00:32:16,845 --> 00:32:19,354
I'm sorry about the rice.

395
00:32:19,458 --> 00:32:21,730
It was kinda embarrassing, though.

396
00:32:21,834 --> 00:32:24,736
I had a feeling people were staring at us.

397
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:27,103
- Nonsense.
- No. Here.

398
00:32:34,491 --> 00:32:37,662
I'm gonna carry you over the threshold.

399
00:32:55,809 --> 00:32:58,191
~ <i> Here comes the bride</i> ~

400
00:32:58,295 --> 00:33:00,817
~ <i> All dressed in white</i> ~

401
00:33:00,923 --> 00:33:05,784
~ <i> And there's the groom</i>
<i>standing right by her side</i> ~

402
00:33:05,889 --> 00:33:08,082
Everybody, this is Helen.

403
00:33:08,182 --> 00:33:11,004
Ben! This is the fella
that gave me my first job.

404
00:33:11,108 --> 00:33:14,134
This is Helen.
You remember Gene Krupa from the show.

405
00:33:14,238 --> 00:33:17,012
Here's Babe Russin, the tenor saxophone.

406
00:33:17,116 --> 00:33:19,766
You remember Chummy.
There's Polly and Don.

407
00:33:19,871 --> 00:33:22,349
We decided to celebrate.
We're gonna have a party.

408
00:33:22,453 --> 00:33:24,978
- Here?
- No, Harlem. Connie's Inn.

409
00:33:25,082 --> 00:33:26,981
Oh. Well, that's awful nice of you.

410
00:33:27,086 --> 00:33:30,444
Helen just arrived.
We've had the wedding and the show

411
00:33:30,548 --> 00:33:32,987
- and Helen's a little tired.
- I'm not.

412
00:33:33,091 --> 00:33:35,240
You've been on the train for three days.

413
00:33:35,345 --> 00:33:39,500
If your friends are nice enough
to give us a party, we should go!

414
00:33:39,604 --> 00:33:42,860
- Wonderful!
- We've already got reservations.

415
00:34:39,189 --> 00:34:42,284
~ <i> Yes, Basin Street</i> ~

416
00:34:42,388 --> 00:34:44,235
~ <i> Is the street</i> ~

417
00:34:45,278 --> 00:34:48,417
~ <i> Where the folks really meet...</i> ~

418
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:50,252
Who's he?

419
00:34:50,356 --> 00:34:52,784
Who? Louis Armstrong!

420
00:34:58,964 --> 00:35:04,225
~ <i> Yeah, yeah, yeah, really, yeah</i> ~

421
00:35:04,329 --> 00:35:08,316
~ <i> Yeah, this is a treat</i> ~

422
00:35:08,420 --> 00:35:14,017
~ <i> A-swingin' on Basin Street, yeah</i> ~

423
00:35:22,575 --> 00:35:24,503
Hey, Gene! Gene Krupa there!

424
00:35:24,608 --> 00:35:27,551
What'd you say?
Come here, man. Gimme some skin.

425
00:35:27,655 --> 00:35:30,717
- How you doin'
- Won't you join us?

426
00:35:30,821 --> 00:35:34,080
Babe Russin! Don't you wanna swing
with the boys?

427
00:35:38,972 --> 00:35:41,048
- Is that gin?
- Yeah.

428
00:37:11,755 --> 00:37:15,642
Glenn, come here, daddy.
Beat out one like you did with Ben Pollack.

429
00:37:15,746 --> 00:37:17,425
Be right back.

430
00:39:10,069 --> 00:39:13,038
- Nice goin', Glenn.
- You were wonderful!

431
00:39:13,143 --> 00:39:15,956
It's fun but I don't kid myself.

432
00:39:16,061 --> 00:39:19,004
When I start playing jazz
with Louis Armstrong and Gene Krupa,

433
00:39:19,108 --> 00:39:22,133
I'm lucky if I come in third, isn't that right?

434
00:39:22,237 --> 00:39:25,135
- Where have you been, Mr Miller?
- Dr Schillinger!

435
00:39:25,239 --> 00:39:29,264
- It must be over a year.
- Glad to see you. This is my wife.

436
00:39:29,368 --> 00:39:32,351
- Very pleased to meet you.
- You remember Chummy.

437
00:39:32,458 --> 00:39:36,647
I missed you but I can see
you had a very charming distraction.

438
00:39:36,752 --> 00:39:39,484
Yeah, well, glad to see you, Doctor.

439
00:39:39,587 --> 00:39:43,237
- Who's Dr Schillinger? Were you sick?
- No, he's a musician.

440
00:39:43,341 --> 00:39:46,788
He worked out a new method
of composition. I studied with him.

441
00:39:46,893 --> 00:39:50,790
- Why did you stop?
- I got busy and it was expensive.

442
00:39:50,895 --> 00:39:52,991
Want something else to eat?

443
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:57,964
- Maybe we'd better call it a day.
- No, I'm having a...

444
00:39:58,068 --> 00:40:01,303
- No, I really had a wonderful time.
- Yes, dear.

445
00:40:01,407 --> 00:40:03,755
- Bye.
- Good night.

446
00:40:09,766 --> 00:40:12,360
~ <i> Ooh-ooh, Basin Street</i> ~

447
00:40:12,464 --> 00:40:14,487
~ <i> Boo-boo boo-boo-boo</i> ~

448
00:40:14,591 --> 00:40:16,613
Well, get you!

449
00:40:16,717 --> 00:40:18,766
Here.

450
00:40:26,785 --> 00:40:28,863
Let's try it again.

451
00:40:54,989 --> 00:40:57,066
Helen?

452
00:40:59,077 --> 00:41:00,822
Helen?

453
00:41:03,084 --> 00:41:06,802
- Good morning.
- Honey, what are you doing up at this hour?

454
00:41:06,906 --> 00:41:09,767
This hour? I've been up since seven.

455
00:41:09,870 --> 00:41:12,682
Well, come here.

456
00:41:12,787 --> 00:41:15,168
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

457
00:41:23,607 --> 00:41:26,449
7:00? It must be dark outside.

458
00:41:26,553 --> 00:41:30,748
No, it is not.
I've been getting up at this hour all of my life.

459
00:41:30,852 --> 00:41:34,418
But you haven't been staying up
until 4:00 in the morning.

460
00:41:34,522 --> 00:41:37,135
Well, no, that's true.
Only when you were around.

461
00:41:37,239 --> 00:41:41,336
That's right.
Your father on the porch with his shotgun.

462
00:41:47,263 --> 00:41:50,013
- What have you been doing?
- The ironing.

463
00:41:50,811 --> 00:41:54,319
The ironing? Honey, this is a hotel.

464
00:41:54,423 --> 00:41:58,032
All you have to do is pick up the phone.
They have people to do that.

465
00:41:58,136 --> 00:42:00,534
- But did you see what they charge?
- No.

466
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:02,708
- It's just terrible.
- Is that so?

467
00:42:02,811 --> 00:42:05,671
I don't think we should
waste our money like that.

468
00:42:05,775 --> 00:42:09,550
- Nobody can say I married a spendthrift.
- No, sir.

469
00:42:09,655 --> 00:42:12,033
I'm a penny-pinching miser.

470
00:42:15,795 --> 00:42:20,148
I'm the kind of wife that steals money
out of your pockets and puts it in the bank.

471
00:42:20,251 --> 00:42:24,173
- Would you really do that?
- Sure. I've already started.

472
00:42:59,562 --> 00:43:01,158
- Hi, dear.
- Hi.

473
00:43:01,258 --> 00:43:05,497
It's a long movie. We have
two hours before the next stage show.

474
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:08,826
- Have a good time?
- I like the show. But the music!

475
00:43:08,930 --> 00:43:11,166
Well, you know the music.

476
00:43:11,271 --> 00:43:15,628
- That isn't the way you want to play, is it?
- No, but I like pit work.

477
00:43:15,732 --> 00:43:18,760
It pays well. You get to stay in one place.

478
00:43:18,864 --> 00:43:23,303
Glenn, I've been thinking.
How much does that Dr Schillinger charge?

479
00:43:23,409 --> 00:43:26,269
He's pretty expensive. I don't know exactly.

480
00:43:26,373 --> 00:43:28,393
I haven't worked with him for years.

481
00:43:28,498 --> 00:43:31,314
That's just exactly what I mean. Why not?

482
00:43:31,418 --> 00:43:33,273
I don't know. I...

483
00:43:33,377 --> 00:43:36,739
What happened to that dream of yours?
What about that sound?

484
00:43:36,843 --> 00:43:39,364
Well, I've been working on that, Helen.

485
00:43:39,467 --> 00:43:43,313
It's an uphill grind.
My chance will come one of these days.

486
00:43:44,617 --> 00:43:48,448
To tell you the truth, Glenn,
I've been sort of disappointed.

487
00:43:51,374 --> 00:43:53,532
You mean that?

488
00:43:58,091 --> 00:44:02,854
If I started to study again,
we'd have to make all sorts of sacrifices.

489
00:44:02,958 --> 00:44:05,055
I'd have to give up those record dates.

490
00:44:06,020 --> 00:44:09,656
Darling, I don't want to live in a fancy hotel.

491
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:12,991
We could get an awfully cute
little apartment.

492
00:44:13,095 --> 00:44:15,691
I just want you to keep on trying.

493
00:44:19,035 --> 00:44:21,112
I've sort of let you down, haven't I?

494
00:44:23,623 --> 00:44:25,365
A little.

495
00:44:27,418 --> 00:44:29,494
I'm sorry, Helen.

496
00:44:32,010 --> 00:44:36,605
You're right. I should start to study again. I...

497
00:44:36,710 --> 00:44:40,400
Why don't I call Schillinger right now?
See if he'll take me back.

498
00:44:40,504 --> 00:44:42,442
I have his phone number here...

499
00:44:42,548 --> 00:44:45,492
It's Trafalgar 7-5-0-9-8.

500
00:44:45,596 --> 00:44:47,866
- 7-5-0-9...
- Eight.

501
00:44:47,970 --> 00:44:50,781
Well... Well...

502
00:44:53,536 --> 00:44:55,409
7-5-0-9-8.

503
00:45:14,980 --> 00:45:16,445
- Helen?
- Yes?

504
00:45:16,549 --> 00:45:21,039
- Where are my glasses?
- Right here! Why don't you put them on?

505
00:45:21,144 --> 00:45:23,956
I'll have to get some glasses
to find my glasses.

506
00:45:24,061 --> 00:45:25,996
What were you playing? It's lovely.

507
00:45:26,101 --> 00:45:30,046
A little exercise I'm working out
for Schillinger. I hope he likes it.

508
00:45:30,151 --> 00:45:32,383
Does that mean you won't be able to use it?

509
00:45:32,487 --> 00:45:36,513
No, that doesn't make any difference.
It's not that good, though.

510
00:45:36,616 --> 00:45:38,221
I think it is.

511
00:45:38,324 --> 00:45:41,310
- You like it as good as Little Brown Jug?
- No.

512
00:45:41,415 --> 00:45:43,687
But I think you should do something with it.

513
00:45:43,791 --> 00:45:47,780
I suppose you could make a song out of it.
Get somebody to write lyrics.

514
00:45:47,885 --> 00:45:51,113
Have to get a title. What's a good title?

515
00:45:51,218 --> 00:45:56,408
Well, it should be soft and romantic.
Sort of like moonlight.

516
00:45:56,511 --> 00:46:00,585
Moonlight. Young lover
under his sweetheart's window.

517
00:46:00,690 --> 00:46:04,379
You wouldn't be thinking
of a certain night in Boulder?

518
00:46:04,486 --> 00:46:07,216
There wasn't any moonlight. Just a shotgun!

519
00:46:07,320 --> 00:46:09,845
I know. And you didn't serenade me either.

520
00:46:09,946 --> 00:46:12,932
I didn't have a chance.
Serenade. There's a title.

521
00:46:13,036 --> 00:46:17,231
- Serenade in the Moonlight.
- How about Moonlight Serenade?

522
00:46:17,335 --> 00:46:19,439
Moonlight Serenade? Not bad.

523
00:46:19,543 --> 00:46:22,114
- It's kinda pretty.
- Moonlight Serenade.

524
00:46:22,218 --> 00:46:25,782
~ <i> I stand at your gate</i> ~

525
00:46:25,887 --> 00:46:29,750
~ <i> And the song that I sing is of moonlight</i> ~

526
00:46:29,854 --> 00:46:33,250
~ <i> I stand and I wait</i> ~

527
00:46:33,354 --> 00:46:37,424
~ <i> For the touch of your hand</i>
<i>in the June night</i> ~

528
00:46:37,529 --> 00:46:40,927
~ <i> The roses are sighin'</i> ~

529
00:46:41,031 --> 00:46:45,140
~ <i> A moonlight serenade</i> ~

530
00:46:45,244 --> 00:46:48,395
~ <i> Let us stray till the break of day</i> ~

531
00:46:48,500 --> 00:46:52,145
~ <i> In love's valley of dreams</i> ~

532
00:46:52,250 --> 00:46:54,238
~ <i> Just you and I</i> ~

533
00:46:54,342 --> 00:46:56,359
~ <i> The summer sky</i> ~

534
00:46:56,463 --> 00:46:59,576
~ <i> A heavenly breeze kissing the trees</i> ~

535
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:03,456
~ <i> So don't let me wait</i> ~

536
00:47:03,560 --> 00:47:07,203
~ <i> Come to me tenderly in the June night</i> ~

537
00:47:07,309 --> 00:47:10,840
~ <i> I stand at your gate</i> ~

538
00:47:10,945 --> 00:47:14,802
~ <i> And I sing you a song in the moonlight</i> ~

539
00:47:14,908 --> 00:47:18,552
~ <i> A love song, my darling</i> ~

540
00:47:18,656 --> 00:47:26,011
~ <i> A moonlight serenade</i> ~

541
00:47:32,274 --> 00:47:35,617
- What have they done to my tune?
- It wasn't very good.

542
00:47:35,722 --> 00:47:39,959
The song is supposed to be a ballad,
not a hootchy-kootchy dance!

543
00:47:40,064 --> 00:47:44,963
They made a production number out of it.
And that arrangement, Holy Moses!

544
00:47:45,067 --> 00:47:46,759
Why wouldn't he use yours?

545
00:47:46,863 --> 00:47:49,346
Every band leader
wants his own arrangement.

546
00:47:49,450 --> 00:47:53,142
So do you! If you had your own band,
this sort of thing wouldn't happen.

547
00:47:53,247 --> 00:47:56,420
- Of course.
- Let's go. We have a lot to do.

548
00:47:57,890 --> 00:48:01,192
We need an instrument truck, and a car.

549
00:48:01,298 --> 00:48:04,026
That's two down payments.
If we use Chummy's car...

550
00:48:04,132 --> 00:48:07,242
Wait till you see what I got now.
Snappiest job on the road.

551
00:48:07,346 --> 00:48:11,369
It's a big Phaeton. Even got
a separate windshield for the back seat.

552
00:48:11,473 --> 00:48:14,168
You can always be
the first one to arrive in town.

553
00:48:14,272 --> 00:48:16,710
We'll need music stands and a copyist.

554
00:48:16,814 --> 00:48:22,004
We can do the copying. Like the old days,
no food but plenty of manuscript paper.

555
00:48:22,108 --> 00:48:23,802
What do you mean, no food?

556
00:48:23,906 --> 00:48:27,437
- We'll need at least 1,800.
- Then we're all set.

557
00:48:27,541 --> 00:48:30,936
Honey, he means we need $1,800
to start the band.

558
00:48:31,041 --> 00:48:33,092
Yes.

559
00:48:34,893 --> 00:48:38,489
- We don't need anything but good luck.
- What's this?

560
00:48:38,593 --> 00:48:40,857
"The Glenn Miller Band Account"?

561
00:48:45,533 --> 00:48:47,822
$1,842!

562
00:48:51,415 --> 00:48:53,573
Now eat your dinner.

563
00:48:58,967 --> 00:49:02,770
Hey. Did you get all that money
out of my pockets?

564
00:49:02,874 --> 00:49:04,838
Mm-hm.

565
00:49:25,166 --> 00:49:28,054
We're late for the job now.
I better go on ahead.

566
00:49:28,159 --> 00:49:32,394
- You fellas get there as quick as you can.
- All right, Glenn.

567
00:49:32,499 --> 00:49:34,460
Practically a new tyre too.

568
00:50:32,290 --> 00:50:34,587
Helen, you don't look very well.

569
00:50:34,691 --> 00:50:38,386
I'm just fine. I'm just a little tired.

570
00:50:38,490 --> 00:50:41,892
And poor Glenn is up all night
working on the arrangements

571
00:50:41,996 --> 00:50:44,729
and I have to sort of
take care of the bookkeeping.

572
00:50:44,833 --> 00:50:49,487
Has the business manager
given you the big financial statement yet?

573
00:50:49,592 --> 00:50:54,158
No, but I will. We left New York
with $42 in the bank.

574
00:50:54,262 --> 00:50:57,451
After six months,
we've paid for the truck and the car.

575
00:50:57,555 --> 00:51:00,123
That leaves a balance of 48.

576
00:51:00,228 --> 00:51:03,626
In short, we're making exactly $1 a month.

577
00:51:03,729 --> 00:51:05,923
So in ten years we'll have made $120.

578
00:51:06,026 --> 00:51:08,539
It takes time for a new band to catch on.

579
00:51:09,837 --> 00:51:11,431
It sure does.

580
00:51:11,536 --> 00:51:14,642
I don't know.
One night we pack 'em in and they love us.

581
00:51:14,746 --> 00:51:16,937
The next six dates we die.

582
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:20,233
We don't seem to be getting anywhere,
and we don't deserve to!

583
00:51:20,338 --> 00:51:24,657
I just haven't been able to hit
the right combination.

584
00:51:24,761 --> 00:51:28,776
I just still haven't got that sound.

585
00:51:29,320 --> 00:51:32,656
Glenn, maybe if you stop playing.

586
00:51:33,783 --> 00:51:36,376
- Touché!
- I'm sorry. I didn't mean...

587
00:51:36,481 --> 00:51:40,046
I know what you mean.
Get a baton and start leading. No.

588
00:51:40,150 --> 00:51:43,929
Once you step out in front of the boys,
you can never be a sideman again.

589
00:51:44,033 --> 00:51:46,052
I'll stick to my trombone.

590
00:51:46,156 --> 00:51:48,310
I've got some good news for a change.

591
00:51:48,414 --> 00:51:52,569
I talked to Si Schribman.
He runs the State Ballroom in Boston.

592
00:51:52,673 --> 00:51:54,817
He's booked you in
for the week of the 22nd.

593
00:51:54,921 --> 00:51:57,819
That means six half-hour air spots.
That's what counts.

594
00:51:57,924 --> 00:52:01,996
- It sure does!
- Imagine! A whole week in one town.

595
00:52:02,101 --> 00:52:04,746
I could even get the washing
and the mending done.

596
00:52:04,851 --> 00:52:07,960
- Let's all drink to Boston!
- I think we should.

597
00:52:08,064 --> 00:52:10,028
Good ol' Boston.

598
00:52:16,752 --> 00:52:20,059
Glenn, why don't you ever use
Moonlight Serenade?

599
00:52:20,165 --> 00:52:23,520
Don't we have enough trouble
without resurrecting that?

600
00:52:23,625 --> 00:52:26,355
- Well, I liked it.
- So did I.

601
00:52:26,460 --> 00:52:29,551
That's two of us.
Now, if we can just find a third.

602
00:52:38,572 --> 00:52:42,208
- How's she look?
- Could be worse. Don't know how.

603
00:52:42,312 --> 00:52:44,961
You need a new axle housing,
an axle shaft,

604
00:52:45,066 --> 00:52:47,963
ring gear and pinion,
differential gear case.

605
00:52:48,067 --> 00:52:51,385
- How long'll it take?
- A few days once I get the parts.

606
00:52:51,489 --> 00:52:55,685
- You don't have 'em here?
- Don't have many calls for ring gears.

607
00:52:55,790 --> 00:52:59,687
Might have to go to Woodstock
soon as it stops snowing.

608
00:52:59,791 --> 00:53:01,760
- It could be worse.
- Yeah.

609
00:53:02,604 --> 00:53:05,149
There's Helen.
Get a hold of Schribman?

610
00:53:05,254 --> 00:53:09,281
No, I couldn't get Boston.
The telephone lines are down.

611
00:53:09,386 --> 00:53:12,286
Chummy, you and Helen
better try and make Boston.

612
00:53:12,390 --> 00:53:14,832
Tell Schribman we'll be there
as soon as we can.

613
00:53:14,936 --> 00:53:17,880
He's probably guessed what happened.

614
00:53:17,986 --> 00:53:21,549
- He wouldn't cancel on us.
- No, we'll get there all right.

615
00:53:21,653 --> 00:53:24,844
We can't lose that week in Boston.
Go ahead. Bye, dear.

616
00:53:24,949 --> 00:53:26,879
- Take care.
- Yeah.

617
00:53:41,654 --> 00:53:43,831
- You Mr Miller?
- Yeah.

618
00:53:43,936 --> 00:53:48,123
Man left a message. Your wife's sick.
They got her to the hospital.

619
00:53:48,227 --> 00:53:50,694
- What hospital?
- Boston Memorial.

620
00:53:55,251 --> 00:53:57,262
Mr Miller, she's a very sick girl.

621
00:53:57,366 --> 00:54:00,975
We gave her a transfusion
but we're lucky this happened when it did.

622
00:54:01,080 --> 00:54:05,187
A few months further along and we might've
lost the mother as well as the child.

623
00:54:05,291 --> 00:54:07,395
I had no idea that she was...

624
00:54:07,500 --> 00:54:09,567
- All right, Doctor.
- Thank you.

625
00:54:09,671 --> 00:54:11,719
Just for a minute.

626
00:54:27,082 --> 00:54:29,240
Helen.

627
00:54:33,759 --> 00:54:35,833
The truck all right?

628
00:54:42,393 --> 00:54:46,320
Five and a quarter, cash on the barrel head.
Take it or leave it, boys.

629
00:54:46,425 --> 00:54:48,446
Better than the others.

630
00:54:48,550 --> 00:54:50,785
I guess we'll have to take it.

631
00:54:50,889 --> 00:54:54,750
Kinda leaves us in a spot.
It's $900 to pay the boys in the band.

632
00:54:54,853 --> 00:54:56,873
With my car? How much'll you give us?

633
00:54:56,978 --> 00:55:00,007
- You're not gonna do it.
- I can sell my own car if I want to.

634
00:55:00,111 --> 00:55:04,260
Four hundred. That makes
nine and a quarter for all three of 'em.

635
00:55:04,364 --> 00:55:08,470
- This isn't your problem.
- Why isn't it? I wanna get paid off, too.

636
00:55:08,575 --> 00:55:10,727
You got a deal. Just one condition.

637
00:55:10,832 --> 00:55:13,896
I need the car long enough
to drive the boys to the station.

638
00:55:14,001 --> 00:55:15,605
Yes, that can be arranged.

639
00:55:15,709 --> 00:55:18,696
Fellas, pile in. I'll drive you to the station.

640
00:55:18,800 --> 00:55:20,850
Thank you, Chummy.

641
00:55:25,572 --> 00:55:28,500
- Hi, dear. How do you feel?
- Fine.

642
00:55:28,600 --> 00:55:31,083
- You look much better.
- Good.

643
00:55:31,187 --> 00:55:34,254
The doctor said if I behave myself,
I'll be up in a few days.

644
00:55:34,361 --> 00:55:36,133
Good.

645
00:55:36,238 --> 00:55:39,179
I've made up my mind
about something, young lady.

646
00:55:39,284 --> 00:55:42,144
If I ever go on the road again,

647
00:55:42,248 --> 00:55:46,688
you're gonna stay in that nice apartment
of ours on East 57th Street.

648
00:55:46,789 --> 00:55:48,858
You just listen to me, Glenn Miller.

649
00:55:48,962 --> 00:55:52,026
You enticed a little country girl
to run away and marry you

650
00:55:52,133 --> 00:55:53,781
and now you're hooked with her.

651
00:55:53,885 --> 00:55:57,743
And I'm not gonna let you go
gallivanting around the country without me.

652
00:55:57,848 --> 00:56:01,125
You're hooked with
a no-good itinerant musician.

653
00:56:01,229 --> 00:56:05,252
- I'm not complaining.
- I know. You never do.

654
00:56:05,357 --> 00:56:09,085
But I know how you wanted kids.

655
00:56:09,190 --> 00:56:12,389
I want to tell you something else
I've made up my mind about.

656
00:56:12,493 --> 00:56:15,640
We're not gonna have just one child.
We're gonna have two!

657
00:56:15,746 --> 00:56:17,769
We're gonna have a boy and a girl.

658
00:56:17,873 --> 00:56:19,561
- Glenn, I can't.
- I know.

659
00:56:19,666 --> 00:56:22,021
The doctor told me, but I mean it.

660
00:56:22,125 --> 00:56:27,097
There'll be two kids meant for us.
Somewhere we're gonna find them.

661
00:56:29,773 --> 00:56:32,067
I hope so.

662
00:56:36,449 --> 00:56:38,584
Who sent these flowers?

663
00:56:38,688 --> 00:56:40,923
- The boys in the band.
- Wasn't that nice?

664
00:56:41,025 --> 00:56:42,991
They're sweet.

665
00:56:44,962 --> 00:56:46,920
What's happened? Any dates?

666
00:56:48,301 --> 00:56:50,624
No. No dates.

667
00:56:52,012 --> 00:56:53,978
There's no band.

668
00:56:54,082 --> 00:56:56,694
We had to sell the cars
and pay off the boys.

669
00:56:56,798 --> 00:57:00,692
Chummy had to sell his Phaeton.
Isn't that a shame?

670
00:57:00,798 --> 00:57:03,395
Poor Chummy really loved that car.

671
00:57:06,531 --> 00:57:09,705
Glenn, you had a good band.

672
00:57:09,810 --> 00:57:13,126
It was getting better all the time.
It wasn't your fault.

673
00:57:13,231 --> 00:57:15,505
It's my fault all right!

674
00:57:15,611 --> 00:57:18,470
I'm broke, I'm in debt,
I don't even have a job.

675
00:57:18,574 --> 00:57:23,514
I told you before, you've gotten mixed up
with a no-good itinerant musician.

676
00:57:23,619 --> 00:57:27,255
- And I love him.
- And I love you.

677
00:57:31,187 --> 00:57:33,151
It's almost worth it.

678
00:57:33,257 --> 00:57:37,894
It's the first time you've told me that
since the day we were married.

679
00:57:50,500 --> 00:57:52,625
Come in.

680
00:57:54,171 --> 00:57:56,892
- Mrs Miller?
- Yes.

681
00:57:56,996 --> 00:57:59,561
I thought so. I can come in?

682
00:57:59,666 --> 00:58:01,630
Well, yes, of course.

683
00:58:04,187 --> 00:58:06,569
I brought you some flowers.

684
00:58:06,673 --> 00:58:09,730
Oh. Well, thank you very much.

685
00:58:13,947 --> 00:58:16,874
- They're all right?
- They're lovely.

686
00:58:16,979 --> 00:58:20,919
I'm a bachelor, I got no wife
to tell me these things.

687
00:58:21,023 --> 00:58:23,886
- Well, they're very pretty.
- Yeah.

688
00:58:23,991 --> 00:58:27,053
I heard all about the band
and how you were sick.

689
00:58:27,157 --> 00:58:30,216
Such a shame. I can sit down a minute?

690
00:58:30,884 --> 00:58:32,711
Yes, please.

691
00:58:33,763 --> 00:58:36,338
"Compliments of the State Ballroom."

692
00:58:37,561 --> 00:58:41,364
- Is this a joke?
- I shoulda said so right away.

693
00:58:41,468 --> 00:58:43,987
No, that's me. Si Schribman.

694
00:58:44,092 --> 00:58:46,788
Si Schribman!
If I'd known who you were...

695
00:58:46,893 --> 00:58:50,540
I know. Don Haynes said you wanted
to give me a piece of your mind.

696
00:58:50,645 --> 00:58:52,584
That's why I came here.

697
00:58:52,688 --> 00:58:55,156
Maybe we can exchange pieces of mind.

698
00:58:56,416 --> 00:59:00,720
I'm not really such an ogre.
I didn't like cancelling you out.

699
00:59:00,824 --> 00:59:04,602
But an old widow lady, 75,
she owns that ballroom.

700
00:59:04,706 --> 00:59:06,979
If I don't have a band, I don't pay the rent.

701
00:59:07,083 --> 00:59:10,526
If I don't pay the rent,
that old lady don't eat.

702
00:59:10,630 --> 00:59:12,676
It's a bad situation.

703
00:59:13,689 --> 00:59:18,325
If she would only die, God forbid,
then I could run it like I like.

704
00:59:18,429 --> 00:59:21,163
- It finished us. You know that.
- Yeah.

705
00:59:21,268 --> 00:59:24,000
- We had to break up the band.
- I know.

706
00:59:24,104 --> 00:59:26,418
I heard the band. It was good.

707
00:59:26,522 --> 00:59:29,338
Not great, mind you, but good, very good.

708
00:59:29,442 --> 00:59:34,725
We were just getting started.
Well, now I don't know what we'll do.

709
00:59:34,828 --> 00:59:39,838
Just don't you worry, young lady.
Get well, and don't worry about the band.

710
00:59:40,803 --> 00:59:42,564
That's easy to say.

711
00:59:42,669 --> 00:59:45,530
I believe in Glenn
and I believe what he's trying to do,

712
00:59:45,634 --> 00:59:47,595
so naturally I worry.

713
00:59:48,396 --> 00:59:51,786
I tell you, you send him over,
he should see me.

714
00:59:51,890 --> 00:59:54,500
With my own money
that don't go to the widow,

715
00:59:54,604 --> 00:59:58,208
- I sometimes invest in bands.
- Do you mean that?

716
00:59:58,313 --> 01:00:01,622
Would I make myself
so much trouble if I didn't?

717
01:00:02,540 --> 01:00:05,635
But there's a problem. I know Glenn.

718
01:00:05,739 --> 01:00:08,635
He's down right now
and he won't accept help.

719
01:00:08,740 --> 01:00:11,639
I don't think he'd risk
somebody else's money.

720
01:00:11,744 --> 01:00:14,477
I never even met your husband
and I like him already.

721
01:00:14,581 --> 01:00:17,480
You just leave it to me.
I'll cook up something.

722
01:00:17,585 --> 01:00:19,900
Thank you very much for coming.

723
01:00:20,005 --> 01:00:22,197
And I'm sorry I was so ungracious.

724
01:00:22,302 --> 01:00:27,203
Who was ungracious? We got along fine
exchanging pieces of mind.

725
01:00:27,309 --> 01:00:29,441
- Goodbye.
- Bye.

726
01:00:34,874 --> 01:00:38,133
I know you don't want a band but I'm stuck.

727
01:00:38,237 --> 01:00:42,304
But this Charley Firman sneaks a band
right out from under my nose.

728
01:00:42,410 --> 01:00:46,850
- I don't have any men. No money.
- I'll give you the money. Here.

729
01:00:46,955 --> 01:00:50,941
Five hundred. Six hundred. A thousand.

730
01:00:51,046 --> 01:00:54,107
There. You got the money.
Now, go get the men.

731
01:00:54,212 --> 01:00:59,496
I've tried all sorts of combinations.
I never found out what I was looking for.

732
01:00:59,601 --> 01:01:03,956
If I start again, I've got to have
an entirely different kind of a band.

733
01:01:04,061 --> 01:01:06,959
Different tunes.
I wanna try something radical.

734
01:01:07,063 --> 01:01:10,425
Fine. Go get radical, but just get going!

735
01:01:10,529 --> 01:01:14,960
I gotta have something in here
making a noise the kids can dance to.

736
01:01:19,261 --> 01:01:20,542
OK.

737
01:01:24,227 --> 01:01:28,241
- Let's have the five saxes right in there.
- Five saxes?

738
01:01:28,345 --> 01:01:30,864
And the trombones over there.

739
01:01:30,968 --> 01:01:33,539
And the four trumpets right behind them.

740
01:01:33,643 --> 01:01:35,828
Four trombones and four trumpets!

741
01:01:35,935 --> 01:01:38,583
When they play,
what's gonna hold the roof on?

742
01:01:38,687 --> 01:01:40,794
Five saxes and a trumpet lead.

743
01:01:40,898 --> 01:01:43,843
Maybe it's good and maybe it ain't,
but it's radical.

744
01:01:43,947 --> 01:01:45,345
Let's try this.

745
01:01:45,449 --> 01:01:49,093
Remember this is a ballad,
so take it nice and easy, don't bruise it.

746
01:01:49,198 --> 01:01:53,229
Joe, you stand up so I can get a balance
between you and the saxophones.

747
01:01:53,333 --> 01:01:55,020
All right, here we go.

748
01:01:55,124 --> 01:01:56,609
One,

749
01:01:56,713 --> 01:01:58,389
two.

750
01:03:17,197 --> 01:03:19,083
What's the matter?

751
01:03:19,187 --> 01:03:21,883
- He cut his lip.
- Let's see.

752
01:03:21,986 --> 01:03:25,509
Oh, no. You really split it open.
You better have it looked at.

753
01:03:25,613 --> 01:03:29,056
- I'm sorry, Glenn.
- Go on, Joe. Take care of it.

754
01:03:29,161 --> 01:03:31,124
Oh, no.

755
01:03:32,551 --> 01:03:34,709
All right, take five, boys.

756
01:03:43,650 --> 01:03:46,075
- Is it bad?
- He'll be out for weeks.

757
01:03:46,179 --> 01:03:49,624
- You get more tough breaks...
- Just when you got a good sound.

758
01:03:49,729 --> 01:03:53,712
It isn't what I want
but if we could've worked on it...

759
01:03:53,819 --> 01:03:57,841
- You can't find another trumpet blower?
- Not with Joe's range.

760
01:03:57,945 --> 01:04:00,467
All the arrangements have a trumpet lead?

761
01:04:00,571 --> 01:04:03,471
He had to hurt his lip
the day before you open.

762
01:04:03,576 --> 01:04:05,977
What are we gonna do?
Postpone the opening?

763
01:04:06,081 --> 01:04:09,645
- Poor old widow lady.
- We're not gonna postpone anything.

764
01:04:09,750 --> 01:04:13,859
We'll open tomorrow if I have to stay up
all night and rewrite the arrangement.

765
01:04:13,965 --> 01:04:17,447
- You can't. It's impossible.
- Wait a minute!

766
01:04:17,552 --> 01:04:19,823
Just a minute. I have an idea.

767
01:04:19,928 --> 01:04:24,288
Willie Schwartz could play
those parts on clarinet. Why not?

768
01:04:24,393 --> 01:04:26,416
You see? Clarinet lead. Why not?

769
01:04:26,520 --> 01:04:29,501
Get me lots of manuscript paper.
Can I use your office?

770
01:04:29,605 --> 01:04:31,260
Sure.

771
01:04:31,362 --> 01:04:35,218
Clarinet lead. Why not?
And, Don, call Helen, tell her not to worry.

772
01:04:35,322 --> 01:04:38,182
Tell her I'll be here all night.
Clarinet lead.

773
01:04:38,286 --> 01:04:42,173
And I can harmonise it real tight,
all in the same octave.

774
01:04:46,686 --> 01:04:48,677
Four saxes and a clarinet.

775
01:04:50,520 --> 01:04:52,518
He better stay up all night.

776
01:07:50,038 --> 01:07:53,176
He looks like he's got it, maybe.
Listen to those kids!

777
01:07:53,280 --> 01:07:57,166
There's no maybe about it.
That's it, that's the sound.

778
01:09:25,576 --> 01:09:27,034
Thank you.

779
01:09:28,619 --> 01:09:30,918
Here's a brand-new number by Jerry Gray.

780
01:09:31,023 --> 01:09:33,621
I hope you like it as much as we do.

781
01:10:09,004 --> 01:10:12,559
I, uh, bought you a present for your birthday.

782
01:10:12,666 --> 01:10:15,770
My birthday? That isn't till next November.

783
01:10:15,874 --> 01:10:18,003
This is for your last birthday.

784
01:10:21,060 --> 01:10:24,062
- Oh, Glenn!
- They're just real.

785
01:10:25,982 --> 01:10:28,059
Here, let me try 'em on for size.

786
01:10:28,943 --> 01:10:30,522
There.

787
01:10:31,864 --> 01:10:34,400
Hm. Not bad.

788
01:12:11,570 --> 01:12:14,038
I forgot to tell you the name of that tune.

789
01:12:14,141 --> 01:12:16,492
We call it String Of Pearls.

790
01:12:48,159 --> 01:12:50,040
- Hi, Mother, Dad!
- Hi, Glenn.

791
01:12:50,144 --> 01:12:52,584
You rested up ready for the big night?

792
01:12:52,689 --> 01:12:55,127
We've had a wonderful time
with little Stevie.

793
01:12:55,231 --> 01:12:57,301
- Quite a boy. Big for his age.
- Isn't he?

794
01:12:57,405 --> 01:13:00,764
I can't tell you how much
it's meant to us to have him.

795
01:13:00,868 --> 01:13:03,186
- Is everything all set?
- Yes, dear.

796
01:13:03,290 --> 01:13:06,354
- Did you get Helen out of the house?
- Oh, yes.

797
01:13:06,458 --> 01:13:09,607
- Where'd she go?
- I suppose she's shopping.

798
01:13:09,711 --> 01:13:12,610
A girl doesn't have
a tenth wedding anniversary every day!

799
01:13:12,715 --> 01:13:15,496
- You sure she doesn't suspect anything?
- Oh, no.

800
01:13:15,596 --> 01:13:18,733
- Is everything all set back here?
- Oh, yes.

801
01:13:21,116 --> 01:13:23,628
I think Helen'll get a big kick out of this.

802
01:13:23,732 --> 01:13:25,445
She certainly will, Glenn.

803
01:13:27,080 --> 01:13:30,175
I've been lookin' about.
Quite a place you got here.

804
01:13:30,279 --> 01:13:32,015
It's beautiful, Glenn.

805
01:13:32,120 --> 01:13:34,975
- Paid for, is it?
- Yes, it's paid for.

806
01:13:35,079 --> 01:13:40,315
- Must be doin' pretty well.
- We hear him every night on that radio!

807
01:13:40,419 --> 01:13:43,150
That's only 15 minutes.
Don't suppose it pays much.

808
01:13:43,254 --> 01:13:47,307
Then there's the records.
And he's playing at the Hotel Pennsylvania.

809
01:14:10,637 --> 01:14:13,978
How much do they pay
for playing on one of those records?

810
01:14:14,083 --> 01:14:17,317
- We get three cents a record.
- Three cents?

811
01:14:17,418 --> 01:14:19,824
Have to sell a heap of records
to make it worthwhile.

812
01:14:19,927 --> 01:14:21,529
But they do, dear!

813
01:14:21,634 --> 01:14:24,619
- Let's go see Stevie.
- No, Helen wants us to wait.

814
01:14:24,724 --> 01:14:27,956
Why? Come on.
Sure, we can go on up there.

815
01:14:28,060 --> 01:14:32,049
- Hi. Stevie and I have a surprise for you.
- You do?

816
01:14:32,153 --> 01:14:34,791
- Let's go up to the nursery.
- Come on.

817
01:14:36,252 --> 01:14:39,097
How many copies
of a record do they sell, son?

818
01:14:39,201 --> 01:14:42,874
Moonlight Serenade,
we sold about 800,000 copies.

819
01:14:45,347 --> 01:14:47,884
- Did you say 800,000?
- That's right.

820
01:14:51,770 --> 01:14:53,700
What's...

821
01:14:53,805 --> 01:14:55,980
Look what just arrived.

822
01:14:59,529 --> 01:15:02,168
This is Stevie's new baby sister.

823
01:15:02,273 --> 01:15:06,083
- Can I pick her up?
- I think so. She's your daughter.

824
01:15:06,187 --> 01:15:10,111
Well, well, well.

825
01:15:10,834 --> 01:15:15,806
So you're Jonnie Dee!
Look, she's beautiful! Isn't she?

826
01:15:15,911 --> 01:15:18,062
Look at those red cheeks.

827
01:15:18,166 --> 01:15:21,726
Stevie, look at your baby sister.
Isn't she beautiful?

828
01:15:21,831 --> 01:15:25,564
- You sure surprised him!
- I've been planning it for months.

829
01:15:25,669 --> 01:15:29,662
- I told 'em I just had to have her today.
- How old is she?

830
01:15:29,766 --> 01:15:32,411
- Six weeks today.
- Old lady.

831
01:15:32,515 --> 01:15:37,623
- She's a hungry old woman.
- This is gonna take some expert action.

832
01:15:37,729 --> 01:15:41,207
Her young father's gonna feed her.
Let's have the bottle.

833
01:15:41,916 --> 01:15:43,880
Here, now. Here we go.

834
01:15:43,985 --> 01:15:46,513
All right, Jonnie Dee. There we are.

835
01:15:46,618 --> 01:15:48,770
How's your appetite?

836
01:15:48,875 --> 01:15:51,267
There! Is this hot enough?

837
01:15:51,372 --> 01:15:55,342
That's a good girl. The kid's starved.

838
01:16:03,065 --> 01:16:06,288
- Helen, we'll be late for the theatre.
- Coming.

839
01:16:06,392 --> 01:16:09,335
- I'll get the car.
- All right, dear.

840
01:16:09,439 --> 01:16:15,133
Glenn, I've been figuring. 800,000 records
at three cents apiece, that's $24,000.

841
01:16:15,237 --> 01:16:17,929
- That's right.
- Just for one record?

842
01:16:18,034 --> 01:16:21,264
Well, you certainly are doing well at that!

843
01:16:21,363 --> 01:16:25,173
All right, boys, right over here.
You all set? All right.

844
01:16:26,218 --> 01:16:28,437
Helen, come on!

845
01:16:28,541 --> 01:16:30,724
I'm coming!

846
01:16:50,667 --> 01:16:52,746
Congratulations!

847
01:16:56,174 --> 01:16:58,250
What a surprise!

848
01:16:59,762 --> 01:17:02,145
- Oh, Mother!
- Darling!

849
01:17:02,249 --> 01:17:04,984
Oh, I'm glad to see you!

850
01:17:05,088 --> 01:17:07,987
- Polly, Don. How are you?
- It's a wonderful surprise!

851
01:17:08,092 --> 01:17:11,076
- We sort of surprised each other.
- Yes, we did!

852
01:17:11,181 --> 01:17:13,163
I've got another surprise.

853
01:17:13,267 --> 01:17:17,082
The band has a number,
and that's exactly what it is, a number.

854
01:17:17,186 --> 01:17:19,419
This is based on a telephone number

855
01:17:19,524 --> 01:17:23,591
that was kind of important to you and me,
Helen, about ten years ago.

856
01:17:23,697 --> 01:17:25,661
Here we go. One. Two.

857
01:17:46,070 --> 01:17:48,193
Now, listen to this. Now, watch.

858
01:17:50,409 --> 01:17:53,244
Pennsylvania 6-5000!

859
01:17:53,956 --> 01:17:56,530
- Remember?
- Yes!

860
01:18:04,841 --> 01:18:07,299
Pennsylvania 6-5000!

861
01:18:08,097 --> 01:18:11,234
Would you like to make this
a really memorable evening?

862
01:18:11,339 --> 01:18:13,905
- Dance with me.
- In front of all these people?

863
01:18:14,008 --> 01:18:17,406
In all the years we've been married
you've never danced with me.

864
01:18:17,509 --> 01:18:20,772
- And I may never get another chance.
- Here we go.

865
01:18:30,375 --> 01:18:32,592
Now.

866
01:18:32,695 --> 01:18:35,541
- Pennsylvania 6-5000!
- Good.

867
01:18:41,427 --> 01:18:42,731
- Hi, Joe.
- Hi, Glenn.

868
01:18:42,833 --> 01:18:44,152
Glad to see ya.

869
01:18:44,257 --> 01:18:46,220
That's good.

870
01:18:51,777 --> 01:18:55,062
Come on, don't stand around.
Come on! Dance it up!

871
01:19:01,583 --> 01:19:03,789
Come on, let's try something.

872
01:19:16,599 --> 01:19:20,185
- That's pretty good. Let's try that again.
- All right.

873
01:19:25,358 --> 01:19:28,030
I think I better go back to the trombone.

874
01:19:31,201 --> 01:19:33,195
You sit down there.

875
01:19:46,677 --> 01:19:48,145
All right, you.

876
01:19:48,250 --> 01:19:51,757
Pennsylvania 6-5-0-0-0!

877
01:20:36,867 --> 01:20:39,667
I'm kinda glad you called me that night.

878
01:20:39,772 --> 01:20:42,922
So am I.
All right, let's have something to eat.

879
01:20:43,026 --> 01:20:45,341
Come on. Come on, dear.

880
01:20:45,445 --> 01:20:48,175
- We're cutting a record of that.
- A record?

881
01:20:48,280 --> 01:20:49,935
- Three cents?
- Right.

882
01:20:50,040 --> 01:20:51,631
That's my boy!

883
01:20:54,135 --> 01:20:56,519
You oughta use that number in your picture.

884
01:20:56,624 --> 01:20:57,939
Picture?

885
01:20:58,044 --> 01:21:00,942
Glenn and the boys
are gonna do a movie in the fall.

886
01:21:01,047 --> 01:21:03,487
- Are you gonna be a movie star?
- Yes, Mother.

887
01:21:03,591 --> 01:21:08,062
I'm gonna play Tarzan and
swing from the trees playing my trombone.

888
01:21:08,612 --> 01:21:10,664
I'd like to propose a toast.

889
01:21:10,769 --> 01:21:13,501
To Glenn and Helen,
who serve the best food in town.

890
01:21:13,605 --> 01:21:18,011
Besides, the price is right.
We can remember when it wasn't like this.

891
01:21:18,115 --> 01:21:22,299
May you be as happy together always
as you are tonight.

892
01:21:26,384 --> 01:21:29,093
Thank you, Chummy.
That was a very nice speech.

893
01:21:29,764 --> 01:21:31,776
It oughta be, I worked on it all day!

894
01:21:31,880 --> 01:21:34,029
You did?

895
01:21:34,133 --> 01:21:40,162
I thought your special number was gonna be
Helen's favourite, Little Brown Jug.

896
01:21:40,268 --> 01:21:41,898
He'd never do that. He hates it.

897
01:21:42,952 --> 01:21:46,127
I knew this would come up sooner or later.

898
01:21:46,232 --> 01:21:48,961
So I have an anniversary present
for my good wife

899
01:21:49,066 --> 01:21:51,048
and on the card it says,

900
01:21:51,153 --> 01:21:53,886
"Ha-ha-ha, you and me

901
01:21:53,990 --> 01:21:56,600
"We hardly ever disagree

902
01:21:56,705 --> 01:21:59,685
"So here you are, this will be

903
01:21:59,790 --> 01:22:03,211
"The one brown jug you'll get from me."

904
01:22:08,231 --> 01:22:11,437
- Roll 'em for a take.
- M3-45, take one.

905
01:22:12,483 --> 01:22:14,313
Here we go.

906
01:22:15,155 --> 01:22:18,654
One, two, three, four.

907
01:24:50,723 --> 01:24:52,799
All right. Save it.

908
01:24:59,111 --> 01:25:01,405
- Hello, everybody.
- Hi, Helen.

909
01:25:01,509 --> 01:25:03,450
Well, hi, dear.

910
01:25:03,554 --> 01:25:05,916
- I thought you'd like lunch.
- I sure would.

911
01:25:06,020 --> 01:25:07,866
I brought the mail.

912
01:25:15,544 --> 01:25:19,683
Chummy, we still have a little time.
Why don't you go over At Last?

913
01:25:19,786 --> 01:25:21,725
Let's go up to the control booth.

914
01:25:21,829 --> 01:25:24,096
- Anything wrong?
- No, no.

915
01:25:27,726 --> 01:25:29,693
Come on, sit down, honey.

916
01:25:29,797 --> 01:25:32,949
Helen, I wanted to talk to you about...

917
01:25:33,054 --> 01:25:37,041
With this picture deal
and the record sales and everything,

918
01:25:37,146 --> 01:25:39,706
- we're pretty well fixed.
- Yes.

919
01:25:39,810 --> 01:25:43,626
And, no matter what happens,
you and the kids,

920
01:25:43,730 --> 01:25:47,095
- you're in good shape.
- Yes, I know.

921
01:25:47,200 --> 01:25:49,386
Can you come to Men's Wardrobe at two?

922
01:25:49,490 --> 01:25:51,643
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

923
01:25:51,747 --> 01:25:54,255
So, I thought that...

924
01:25:55,221 --> 01:25:58,026
What I'm trying to get at...

925
01:25:58,130 --> 01:26:00,147
I've been thinking... Yeah?

926
01:26:00,252 --> 01:26:03,116
On Tuxedo Junction,
we'll have a wax right after lunch.

927
01:26:03,220 --> 01:26:05,312
Fine. Thanks very much.

928
01:26:06,359 --> 01:26:10,459
- So...
- Open the letter from the War Department.

929
01:26:10,562 --> 01:26:14,332
- I'm sure it's your commission.
- How do you know?

930
01:26:14,438 --> 01:26:18,546
I've known it for months.
I knew it was only a question of time.

931
01:26:18,650 --> 01:26:23,425
I just put in for it two weeks ago.
I guess you found out about it before I did.

932
01:26:23,529 --> 01:26:26,684
Go on, open it.
I want to know what to call you.

933
01:26:26,789 --> 01:26:28,753
Let's see.

934
01:26:32,018 --> 01:26:34,194
This is it all right.

935
01:26:34,299 --> 01:26:37,572
Captain. Captain Alton G Miller.

936
01:26:37,678 --> 01:26:41,979
Serial number 0-4-5-0-5-2-7-3.

937
01:26:43,948 --> 01:26:47,114
How soon will you be leaving,
Captain Miller?

938
01:26:47,701 --> 01:26:50,128
I don't know. It usually takes about a month.

939
01:26:50,232 --> 01:26:52,752
Don wants to go with me,
so do some of the boys.

940
01:26:52,856 --> 01:26:55,926
- Are you gonna have your own band?
- I hope so.

941
01:26:56,030 --> 01:27:00,354
You know, all the kids
that liked our music are in the service.

942
01:27:00,457 --> 01:27:03,019
- That's the reason I...
- I understand.

943
01:27:03,123 --> 01:27:05,772
I think you'll look very handsome in uniform.

944
01:27:05,876 --> 01:27:10,151
What do you think about it?
Are you upset?

945
01:27:10,256 --> 01:27:13,368
Of course I'm upset.
I don't want you to go

946
01:27:13,471 --> 01:27:17,439
but I guess I'd be
even more upset if you didn't.

947
01:27:37,097 --> 01:27:40,899
- They sound good.
- Do we have to play this kind of music?

948
01:27:41,004 --> 01:27:43,654
We've marched to this music
for a hundred years.

949
01:27:43,754 --> 01:27:47,564
- That's what I mean.
- We're not gonna change now, Captain.

950
01:28:50,565 --> 01:28:53,816
We gotta do better
than this for General Arnold.

951
01:30:24,639 --> 01:30:26,520
In all my 27 years in the Army

952
01:30:26,624 --> 01:30:30,403
I have never witnessed a more
flagrant breach of military decorum.

953
01:30:30,508 --> 01:30:34,405
- Sorry, Colonel.
- And walking through a reviewing column!

954
01:30:34,509 --> 01:30:37,454
- I had to get to the band, sir.
- Then playing blues!

955
01:30:37,559 --> 01:30:41,962
You made a laughing stock of this entire
unit, and in front of General Arnold!

956
01:30:42,068 --> 01:30:44,840
- I had no such intentions.
- What was your intention?

957
01:30:44,944 --> 01:30:48,257
Blasting out right in the General's face!

958
01:30:48,362 --> 01:30:50,596
The men seemed tired, sir.

959
01:30:50,701 --> 01:30:54,056
- The men's condition is my responsibility.
- Yes, sir.

960
01:30:54,161 --> 01:30:57,730
I must warn you that your conduct calls
for disciplinary action.

961
01:30:57,831 --> 01:30:59,105
Yes, sir.

962
01:30:59,209 --> 01:31:01,111
Come in.

963
01:31:01,215 --> 01:31:04,987
Just wanted to say goodbye,
we're due in Washington tonight.

964
01:31:05,092 --> 01:31:07,408
General Arnold, it's been a pleasure.

965
01:31:07,513 --> 01:31:10,576
- I'm sorry that...
- Aren't you Captain Glenn Miller?

966
01:31:10,681 --> 01:31:13,914
- Yes, sir.
- I want to congratulate you on your band.

967
01:31:14,018 --> 01:31:17,501
- Thank you, sir.
- Great morale builder.

968
01:31:17,605 --> 01:31:20,923
The effect was astonishing!
Keep up the good work.

969
01:31:21,028 --> 01:31:23,549
- Yes, sir.
- I like your music myself.

970
01:31:23,653 --> 01:31:25,473
Makes me think of home.

971
01:31:25,578 --> 01:31:28,060
My children play your records day and night.

972
01:31:28,164 --> 01:31:30,978
- May I make a suggestion, sir?
- Certainly.

973
01:31:31,082 --> 01:31:35,191
I'd like to suggest that I be given
the authority to form my own band.

974
01:31:35,295 --> 01:31:36,863
Play my kind of music.

975
01:31:36,967 --> 01:31:38,983
Most of my men are in the service.

976
01:31:39,089 --> 01:31:43,451
If we can be sent overseas,
I know we can be of value.

977
01:31:43,556 --> 01:31:47,456
As you say, I think we can give the boys
a piece of home.

978
01:31:47,560 --> 01:31:50,672
I must say I agree with you, Miller.

979
01:31:50,772 --> 01:31:53,583
- I'll see what I can do.
- Thank you, sir.

980
01:32:06,431 --> 01:32:08,342
Glenn!

981
01:32:09,685 --> 01:32:11,900
Well, gee, I didn't expect this!

982
01:32:12,006 --> 01:32:14,027
General Arnold brought us.

983
01:32:14,132 --> 01:32:17,784
General, thank you.
I appreciate everything you've done.

984
01:32:17,888 --> 01:32:21,876
A pleasure. I'll probably get court-martialed
but I brought 'em anyway.

985
01:32:21,981 --> 01:32:23,667
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

986
01:32:23,771 --> 01:32:26,089
- Goodbye and thank you.
- I enjoyed it.

987
01:32:26,193 --> 01:32:28,341
- Goodbye, General.
- Goodbye.

988
01:32:28,444 --> 01:32:30,714
Well, Jonnie Dee.

989
01:32:30,819 --> 01:32:34,265
You got a hug for your daddy?
Got a hug for your daddy?

990
01:32:34,369 --> 01:32:36,185
That's a girl!

991
01:32:36,289 --> 01:32:39,436
How about you, young man?
How about you?

992
01:32:39,541 --> 01:32:42,189
- Can I fly in your airplane?
- I'm afraid not.

993
01:32:42,294 --> 01:32:44,732
You have to stay
and take care of your mother.

994
01:32:44,837 --> 01:32:47,405
You be good
and don't cause him any trouble.

995
01:32:47,510 --> 01:32:51,241
- I'll try not to. You take care of yourself.
- Don't worry.

996
01:32:51,345 --> 01:32:54,497
You show 'em a picture of me
every once in a while.

997
01:32:54,603 --> 01:32:57,587
I promise. And I'll read them your letters,
if you write.

998
01:32:57,688 --> 01:32:59,462
I'm gonna write.

999
01:32:59,567 --> 01:33:02,842
Gee, I'm gettin' homesick already.

1000
01:33:02,947 --> 01:33:07,515
It's funny how you can miss a person
even before he's gone.

1001
01:33:07,619 --> 01:33:09,586
Hurry it up, Glenn.

1002
01:33:10,431 --> 01:33:13,263
Goodbye, dear.
Goodbye, Stevie. Bye.

1003
01:34:23,061 --> 01:34:26,031
This is Glenn Miller
and the American Band of the AEF.

1004
01:34:26,136 --> 01:34:30,408
Coming to you from Buzz Bomb Alley
through the courtesy of the BBC.

1005
01:34:30,511 --> 01:34:34,209
And to all you GI boys and girls
a long, long way from home,

1006
01:34:34,314 --> 01:34:38,501
and to all our British friends as well,
we hope to give you a little lift.

1007
01:34:38,606 --> 01:34:40,171
That's why we're here.

1008
01:34:40,276 --> 01:34:44,744
We'll start right out by seeing
if we can put you In The Mood.

1009
01:38:12,929 --> 01:38:17,111
Thank you. A little while ago
an airplane landed out here

1010
01:38:17,213 --> 01:38:21,654
and out stepped a singing group
that you all know.

1011
01:38:21,758 --> 01:38:23,992
They sang with me back in the States.

1012
01:38:24,096 --> 01:38:27,328
Let's give 'em a good, warm welcome.
The Modernaires!

1013
01:38:27,432 --> 01:38:29,444
The Modernaires!

1014
01:38:35,040 --> 01:38:39,471
And somebody else stepped out of
that same airplane. A big surprise, boys.

1015
01:38:39,576 --> 01:38:41,679
Here's a girl you all know.

1016
01:38:41,784 --> 01:38:44,645
She's flown across the ocean
just to sing for you.

1017
01:38:44,749 --> 01:38:48,882
Let's give her a good, big ETO welcome.
Frances Langford!

1018
01:38:53,272 --> 01:38:54,931
Hi, Frances.

1019
01:38:59,863 --> 01:39:01,828
- Thank you, Glenn.
- Thank you.

1020
01:39:01,933 --> 01:39:04,692
- That's from Helen.
- Bless your heart.

1021
01:39:06,954 --> 01:39:12,088
I'll start out by taking you on a trip
south of the Mason-Dixon line.

1022
01:39:12,192 --> 01:39:15,704
Let's all get aboard
that old Chattanooga Choo Choo.

1023
01:40:11,490 --> 01:40:14,835
~ <i> Hi there, Fran, what you say?</i> ~

1024
01:40:14,939 --> 01:40:18,633
~ <i> Step aside, partner, it's my day</i> ~

1025
01:40:18,738 --> 01:40:22,496
~ <i> Lend an ear and listen to my version</i> ~

1026
01:40:23,925 --> 01:40:30,096
~ <i> Of a really solid Tennessee excursion</i> ~

1027
01:40:31,686 --> 01:40:35,822
~ <i> Pardon me, boy,</i>
<i>is this the Chattanooga Choo Choo?</i> ~

1028
01:40:35,926 --> 01:40:37,364
~ <i> Yes, yes</i> ~

1029
01:40:37,468 --> 01:40:39,439
~ <i> Track 29</i> ~

1030
01:40:40,488 --> 01:40:43,108
~ <i> Boy, you can give me a shine</i> ~

1031
01:40:45,203 --> 01:40:49,383
~ <i> I can afford</i>
<i>to board the Chattanooga Choo Choo</i> ~

1032
01:40:49,487 --> 01:40:51,051
~ <i> Yes, yes</i> ~

1033
01:40:51,155 --> 01:40:53,929
~ <i> I've got my fare</i> ~

1034
01:40:54,033 --> 01:40:56,957
~ <i> And just a trifle to spare</i> ~

1035
01:40:57,427 --> 01:41:02,059
~ <i> You leave the Pennsylvania Station</i>
<i>'bout a quarter to four</i> ~

1036
01:41:02,164 --> 01:41:05,609
~ <i> Read a magazine</i>
<i>and then you're in Baltimore</i> ~

1037
01:41:05,714 --> 01:41:08,903
~ <i> Dinner in the diner</i>
~ <i> Nothing could be finer</i> ~

1038
01:41:09,007 --> 01:41:12,618
~ <i> Than to have your ham and eggs</i>
<i>in Carolina</i> ~

1039
01:41:12,721 --> 01:41:15,951
~ <i> When you hear the whistle blowin'</i>
<i>eight to the bar</i> ~

1040
01:41:16,054 --> 01:41:19,504
~ <i> Then you know</i>
<i>that Tennessee is not very far</i> ~

1041
01:41:19,609 --> 01:41:22,920
~ <i> Shovel all the coal in</i>
~ <i> Gotta keep it rollin'</i> ~

1042
01:41:23,024 --> 01:41:26,581
~ <i> Woo-woo, Chattanooga there you are</i> ~

1043
01:41:29,672 --> 01:41:31,599
~ <i> There's gonna be</i> ~

1044
01:41:31,704 --> 01:41:34,466
~ <i> A certain party at the station</i> ~

1045
01:41:35,722 --> 01:41:37,847
~ <i> Waitin' for me</i> ~

1046
01:41:38,351 --> 01:41:41,103
~ <i> How very happy we'll be</i> ~

1047
01:41:42,896 --> 01:41:45,114
~ <i> He's gonna sigh</i> ~

1048
01:41:45,218 --> 01:41:49,376
~ <i> Until I tell him that I'll never roam</i> ~

1049
01:41:49,481 --> 01:41:53,545
~ <i> So, Chattanooga Choo Choo,</i>
<i>won't you choo-choo me home?</i> ~

1050
01:41:53,649 --> 01:41:55,797
~ <i> Chattanooga, Chattanooga</i> ~

1051
01:41:55,902 --> 01:41:58,957
~ <i> All aboard</i>
~ <i> Chattanooga, Chattanooga</i> ~

1052
01:41:59,332 --> 01:42:02,667
~ <i> All aboard</i>
~ <i> Chattanooga, Chattanooga</i> ~

1053
01:42:03,173 --> 01:42:11,183
~ <i> Chattanooga Choo Choo,</i>
<i>won't you choo-choo me home?</i> ~

1054
01:43:47,800 --> 01:43:51,060
Remember that?

1055
01:43:51,164 --> 01:43:54,445
Seems a million years since we made that.

1056
01:43:54,550 --> 01:43:56,513
I wrote Glenn what you asked.

1057
01:43:57,481 --> 01:44:00,826
I want to read you his answer. He says...

1058
01:44:00,931 --> 01:44:03,036
"Tell Chummy not to take the job.

1059
01:44:03,141 --> 01:44:06,622
"As long as there's a Glenn Miller Band,
he'll be a part of it.

1060
01:44:06,727 --> 01:44:09,877
"Don and I have been making plans
for after the war.

1061
01:44:09,981 --> 01:44:12,421
"I have a lot of ideas for new arrangements,

1062
01:44:12,526 --> 01:44:15,924
"so tell Chummy to start looking
for a friendly pawn shop."

1063
01:44:16,029 --> 01:44:19,892
Friendly pawn shop.
He hasn't changed, has he?

1064
01:44:19,996 --> 01:44:23,852
Yes, he has! He's been promoted.
He's Major Glenn Miller now.

1065
01:44:23,957 --> 01:44:28,149
Major? That's wonderful.
I wish I could've gone with him.

1066
01:44:28,254 --> 01:44:32,490
You'd have made a fine soldier
with your heart and ulcers!

1067
01:44:32,595 --> 01:44:36,518
I've got two eyes and ten fingers.
That's all you need to play the piano.

1068
01:44:38,073 --> 01:44:40,668
They're going to Paris. I told you that.

1069
01:44:40,769 --> 01:44:44,586
And he says, "We're doing
a special programme on Christmas Day."

1070
01:44:44,690 --> 01:44:46,674
It's gonna be broadcast over here.

1071
01:44:46,779 --> 01:44:51,430
"Be sure and listen cos I'm sending you
an extra special Christmas present."

1072
01:44:51,534 --> 01:44:54,518
And I'll know what it is
if I listen to the programme.

1073
01:44:54,623 --> 01:44:59,091
- I wonder what he's gonna do.
- I don't know. But I'm sure gonna listen.

1074
01:45:19,667 --> 01:45:21,882
- Morning, Glenn.
- Morning, Colonel.

1075
01:45:21,985 --> 01:45:24,470
- I sure appreciate the lift.
- Not at all.

1076
01:45:24,574 --> 01:45:26,599
- You coming too?
- No. Tomorrow.

1077
01:45:26,702 --> 01:45:28,642
I got some work to do in Paris.

1078
01:45:28,746 --> 01:45:32,440
They're gonna let us do some shows
at the advance bases.

1079
01:45:32,545 --> 01:45:34,610
It's kinda soupy, isn't it?

1080
01:45:34,714 --> 01:45:38,102
It's always this way in December.
Shall we hop in?

1081
01:45:39,149 --> 01:45:42,910
Don, I don't know where I'll be,
so as soon as you land at Orly,

1082
01:45:43,014 --> 01:45:45,119
get in touch with the dispatcher.

1083
01:45:45,224 --> 01:45:47,748
Be sure the band goes over
that new arrangement.

1084
01:45:47,852 --> 01:45:50,922
- I want to use it.
- Right. See you tomorrow.

1085
01:45:51,026 --> 01:45:54,746
Pick up my mail.
I'm expecting a letter from Helen. Bye.

1086
01:46:25,751 --> 01:46:28,213
All right, hurry it up, you guys.

1087
01:46:28,318 --> 01:46:31,793
This is Paris. You wanted to see it.
Now's your chance.

1088
01:46:40,144 --> 01:46:44,904
I'm Lieutenant Haynes. Did Major
Glenn Miller leave a message here for me?

1089
01:46:45,008 --> 01:46:47,742
Nothing here, sir.
Did you try Flight Control?

1090
01:46:47,846 --> 01:46:52,860
No, he said he'd leave it here. He came
with Colonel Barrell on the Norseman.

1091
01:46:56,040 --> 01:46:57,881
The flight wasn't logged in.

1092
01:46:57,987 --> 01:47:01,258
No Norseman has landed here
in two or three days.

1093
01:47:01,362 --> 01:47:03,042
Thanks.

1094
01:47:10,010 --> 01:47:13,816
- General! I thought you were in Europe.
- Just arrived.

1095
01:47:13,920 --> 01:47:17,282
- May I congratulate you on your promotion?
- Thank you.

1096
01:47:17,387 --> 01:47:19,282
Five Star final.

1097
01:47:19,387 --> 01:47:21,598
Sounds like a late evening paper.

1098
01:47:23,319 --> 01:47:27,124
- Have you heard about Glenn Miller?
- Yes, this morning.

1099
01:47:27,229 --> 01:47:28,752
Notified his family yet?

1100
01:47:28,856 --> 01:47:32,465
We've been ordered to withhold notifications
until after Christmas.

1101
01:47:32,570 --> 01:47:37,428
His band is broadcasting tomorrow.
We can't let Mrs Miller find out that way.

1102
01:47:37,532 --> 01:47:40,978
- Do you mind if I call her personally?
- Of course not.

1103
01:47:41,083 --> 01:47:43,209
- Use my telephone.
- Thank you.

1104
01:47:50,354 --> 01:47:54,537
It's still a couple of minutes
before the broadcast, Helen.

1105
01:47:54,641 --> 01:47:58,664
You know, I never realised
how wonderful friends could be.

1106
01:47:58,768 --> 01:48:01,663
Even General Arnold, he called me himself.

1107
01:48:01,768 --> 01:48:06,158
That's why he's where he is, maybe,
because he's that kind of a guy.

1108
01:48:19,638 --> 01:48:22,614
Last night when I couldn't sleep,
I got to thinking.

1109
01:48:22,718 --> 01:48:24,652
It come to me about this broadcast.

1110
01:48:24,756 --> 01:48:27,685
You know, Helen, this is a test.

1111
01:48:28,483 --> 01:48:30,702
A test? How do you mean?

1112
01:48:30,807 --> 01:48:34,621
You remember how much we talked,
all of us,

1113
01:48:34,726 --> 01:48:39,254
about how Glenn's band
was something different?

1114
01:48:39,357 --> 01:48:43,248
Something permanent? An institution, like!

1115
01:48:44,796 --> 01:48:47,807
Yeah, Glenn and I talked about it often.

1116
01:48:47,911 --> 01:48:50,100
Don't you see what Si's getting at?

1117
01:48:50,204 --> 01:48:53,481
If the band goes on,
even if Glenn's not with it,

1118
01:48:53,586 --> 01:48:55,152
that's the proof.

1119
01:48:55,255 --> 01:48:59,323
It means that Glenn's band,
Glenn's music, keeps right on going,

1120
01:48:59,427 --> 01:49:04,034
and the kids'll be dancing to it
for years and years.

1121
01:49:04,138 --> 01:49:05,912
That's what he wanted.

1122
01:49:06,017 --> 01:49:09,574
'We take you now to Paris
for a special programme.'

1123
01:49:49,012 --> 01:49:53,265
'A s some of you might know,
Major Glenn Miller is not with us today.

1124
01:49:53,634 --> 01:49:58,002
'But in his absence, we shall do this
programme exactly as he had planned it.

1125
01:49:58,874 --> 01:50:01,228
'Our first number is a new arrangement

1126
01:50:01,333 --> 01:50:04,978
'which Major Miller himself
made especially for this performance.

1127
01:50:05,511 --> 01:50:07,649
'T his tune should be a familiar one,

1128
01:50:07,922 --> 01:50:12,835
'especially to the members of Major Miller's
family across the ocean who are listening.'
