1
00:01:36,899 --> 00:01:40,933
Well, a very good dinner, Sibil! 
Tell cook from me.

2
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Absolutely first class.

3
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,541
- Arthur, you're not supposed 
to say such things!

4
00:01:44,547 --> 00:01:47,077
Come come, I'm treating 
Gerald like one of the family.

5
00:01:47,078 --> 00:01:50,544
I'm sure he won't object.
- Go on Gerald, just do object.

6
00:01:50,602 --> 00:01:51,736
No I wouldn't dream of it.

7
00:01:51,825 --> 00:01:53,485
In fact, I insist on being 
one of the family now.

8
00:01:53,606 --> 00:01:56,057
I've been trying long enough, haven't I?

9
00:01:56,088 --> 00:01:58,576
Well haven't I? You know I have!
- Of course she does!

10
00:01:58,641 --> 00:02:01,023
Yes, except for all last summer 
when you never came near me

11
00:02:01,090 --> 00:02:02,538
 and I wondered what had happened to you

12
00:02:02,598 --> 00:02:05,376
And I've told you. I was awfully busy...
- Yes, that's what you say

13
00:02:05,377 --> 00:02:07,192
Now Sheila, stop teasing him

14
00:02:07,193 --> 00:02:10,446
When you're married you'll realize 
that men with important work to do

15
00:02:10,447 --> 00:02:14,074
sometimes have to spend all their 
time and energy on their business.

16
00:02:14,075 --> 00:02:16,884
You'll get used to it, just as I had to.

17
00:02:16,885 --> 00:02:21,018
I don't believe I will. 
So you be careful. - Oh, I will, I will.

18
00:02:21,053 --> 00:02:24,097
I'll never let business 
interfere with pleasure.

19
00:02:25,752 --> 00:02:27,335
What's the joke, Eric?

20
00:02:27,396 --> 00:02:29,136
I dunno.

21
00:02:29,410 --> 00:02:31,546
I suddenly felt I had to laugh.

22
00:02:31,581 --> 00:02:33,917
I'm sure you're squiffy.
- I tell you I'm not.

23
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,172
The words you girls pick up these days!

24
00:02:36,354 --> 00:02:37,991
If you think that's the best 
she can do, mother...

25
00:02:38,125 --> 00:02:40,206
Don't be a fool, Eric. 
- Now stop it, you two.

26
00:02:40,207 --> 00:02:44,387
Arthur, what about that toast of yours?
- Oh, yes, of course

27
00:02:44,415 --> 00:02:51,180
Well, here's wishing the pair of 
you best that life can bring

28
00:02:51,215 --> 00:02:53,558
Yes, Gerald
Yes, Sheila darling

29
00:02:53,793 --> 00:02:56,033
Our love, and very best wishes.

30
00:02:56,492 --> 00:02:59,119
Eric! 
- Ah? Oh!

31
00:02:59,937 --> 00:03:01,533
Yes, all the best!

32
00:03:01,568 --> 00:03:06,008
She's got a filthy temper sometimes, 
but as a sister she's not bad really.

33
00:03:11,041 --> 00:03:12,915
Well I can't drink to this, can I?

34
00:03:13,010 --> 00:03:16,096
When do I drink?
- You can drink to me.

35
00:03:16,282 --> 00:03:17,858
Alright then.

36
00:03:20,378 --> 00:03:23,646
I drink to you, Gerald.
- Thank you.

37
00:03:24,181 --> 00:03:25,435
And I drink to you.

38
00:03:25,662 --> 00:03:29,082
I hope that I can make you 
as happy as you deserve.

39
00:03:31,856 --> 00:03:33,565
You be careful or I'll start weeping.

40
00:03:33,663 --> 00:03:36,089
Perhaps this will help you to stop it.

41
00:03:36,445 --> 00:03:37,938
You've got it!

42
00:03:38,432 --> 00:03:40,721
It's the one I wanted! 
- Very one.

43
00:03:46,233 --> 00:03:47,658
Steady the buffs!

44
00:03:49,435 --> 00:03:50,852
It's wonderful.

45
00:03:51,334 --> 00:03:53,190
Look mommy, isn't it a beauty?

46
00:03:53,422 --> 00:03:57,602
Now I really feel engaged!
- So you should. It's a beautiful ring.

47
00:03:57,654 --> 00:04:01,094
Take care of it. - I'll never let it 
out of my sight for an instant.

48
00:04:01,185 --> 00:04:04,751
And I'll never let you out 
either, business or no business.

49
00:04:05,767 --> 00:04:09,500
You know, I'm delighted 
about this engagement.

50
00:04:09,535 --> 00:04:11,640
Take my word for it, when you two marry

51
00:04:11,678 --> 00:04:13,594
you'll be marrying at a very good time.

52
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:17,905
A time of steadily increasing 
prosperity and progress.

53
00:04:18,055 --> 00:04:19,402
I believe you're right.

54
00:04:19,511 --> 00:04:21,774
Well what about war? 
-War?

55
00:04:21,809 --> 00:04:24,860
Fiddlesticks! The Germans 
don't want war, nobody wants war!

56
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:26,500
There's too much at stake these days.

57
00:04:26,573 --> 00:04:28,690
Everything to lose and nothing to gain.

58
00:04:28,716 --> 00:04:32,916
Yes I know, but still there's... 
- I say there isn't a chance of war!

59
00:04:33,438 --> 00:04:37,205
When you're living in 1912, 
you've got to think like 1912

60
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:40,401
Why, the world is developing so 
fast it'll make war impossible.

61
00:04:40,402 --> 00:04:42,201
Yes, of course dear.

62
00:04:42,407 --> 00:04:44,747
Now don't keep Gerald in here too long.

63
00:04:49,397 --> 00:04:51,364
Eric, I want you a minute.

64
00:04:51,941 --> 00:04:53,990
Sheila dear, go on 
into the drawing room.

65
00:04:54,412 --> 00:04:56,361
I want to have a private word
with Eric. -Alright, mother.

66
00:04:56,521 --> 00:04:59,107
It's about time someone 
had a word with him.

67
00:04:59,108 --> 00:05:01,419
Poor old Gerald. If only he knew.

68
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:04,025
Eric dear, don't mind 
what I'm going to say,

69
00:05:04,025 --> 00:05:06,688
But if I were you I shouldn't have 
involved a drink tonight.

70
00:05:06,752 --> 00:05:08,379
I'm perfectly alright mother.

71
00:05:08,497 --> 00:05:10,672
Yes of course you are darling, 
I'm not saying you aren't

72
00:05:10,811 --> 00:05:13,088
But on a celebration like 
this one gets excited.

73
00:05:13,219 --> 00:05:15,347
Sometimes one doesn't notice 
how much one is taking.

74
00:05:15,596 --> 00:05:17,564
I only had a couple of glasses, mother.

75
00:05:17,599 --> 00:05:21,539
I dare say! That's quite enough for a 
boy of your age, you're not used to it.

76
00:05:21,634 --> 00:05:23,675
Look at your waistcoat, 
you've spilled something on it

77
00:05:32,794 --> 00:05:35,925
And be careful - Don't worry, mother

78
00:05:41,555 --> 00:05:43,475
Have a cigar. - No, thank you.

79
00:05:43,871 --> 00:05:45,956
Help yourself. - Thank you.

80
00:05:45,991 --> 00:05:48,142
There's something I'd like to mention,

81
00:05:48,177 --> 00:05:51,197
I've got an idea that your 
mother, Lady Croft, well,

82
00:05:51,331 --> 00:05:54,183
she doesn't, er, object to my girl,

83
00:05:54,218 --> 00:05:58,310
feels that you might be doing 
better for yourself socially.

84
00:05:58,308 --> 00:06:01,806
Oh no Sir I'm sure you 
- Oh no Gerald, that's quite alright.

85
00:06:01,878 --> 00:06:04,785
She comes from an old 
county family and it's only natural.

86
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,875
But what I wanted to say is...

87
00:06:06,972 --> 00:06:10,753
There's a fair chance of my 
getting into the next honours list.

88
00:06:10,818 --> 00:06:12,786
Oh, I say, congratulations!

89
00:06:12,819 --> 00:06:16,413
It's a bit too early for that yet, 
so don't say anything

90
00:06:16,539 --> 00:06:18,619
But I've had a hint or two.

91
00:06:18,654 --> 00:06:22,201
I gather there's a very 
good chance of a knighthood.

92
00:06:22,236 --> 00:06:24,365
So long as we behave ourselves...

93
00:06:24,366 --> 00:06:27,264
and don't get into the 
police courts, ahahahahaha

94
00:06:27,299 --> 00:06:31,179
What's that about police courts?
- Nothing, just a little joke, hehe!

95
00:06:31,571 --> 00:06:33,230
Doesn't seem very funny to me.

96
00:06:33,231 --> 00:06:36,776
I was just telling Gerald that now 
that he and Sheila are engaged,

97
00:06:36,777 --> 00:06:38,463
we must all behave ourselves.

98
00:06:38,464 --> 00:06:41,648
No scandals, no monkey business

99
00:06:41,683 --> 00:06:46,013
You seem a nice, well-behaved 
family to me. - We think we are.

100
00:06:46,014 --> 00:06:47,457
Mister Berling.

101
00:06:50,265 --> 00:06:51,360
Yes?

102
00:06:51,883 --> 00:06:56,310
My name's Poole. Inspector Poole.
- What's the meaning of this?

103
00:06:56,345 --> 00:06:58,110
There's a front door, you know!

104
00:06:58,111 --> 00:07:00,461
I want to talk to you Mister Birling, 
I thought I'd find you here.

105
00:07:00,462 --> 00:07:01,640
Very bright of you, I'm sure! 

106
00:07:01,730 --> 00:07:03,730
People usually are in the 
dining room at dinner time!

107
00:07:04,335 --> 00:07:07,035
Oh well, now you're here, 
where's the warrant?

108
00:07:07,290 --> 00:07:09,290
Oh there's no warrant, Mister Berling

109
00:07:09,290 --> 00:07:10,275
Well what is it then?

110
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:12,430
I'd like some information 
if you don't mind.

111
00:07:13,376 --> 00:07:15,629
You'd better sit down.

112
00:07:15,864 --> 00:07:16,848
Thank you.

113
00:07:25,126 --> 00:07:26,256
Well?

114
00:07:26,291 --> 00:07:30,118
About two hours ago a young 
woman died in the infirmary.

115
00:07:30,119 --> 00:07:33,279
She'd been removed there this 
afternoon after taking poison.

116
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:36,060
It's believed some strong disinfectant

117
00:07:36,061 --> 00:07:39,897
How horrible!
 - Yes, it wasn't a pleasant sight.

118
00:07:39,932 --> 00:07:44,260
Suicide? - Well then, of course 
we don't know yet, for certain.

119
00:07:44,605 --> 00:07:50,683
They did everything they could 
for her in the infirmary, but she died.

120
00:07:51,628 --> 00:07:54,550
But I don't understand why 
you've come here, inspector?

121
00:07:57,794 --> 00:08:00,529
Like a lot of young these women 
who get into various kinds of trouble,

122
00:08:00,598 --> 00:08:02,052
she used more than one name.

123
00:08:02,155 --> 00:08:04,874
But her original name, her real name

124
00:08:05,433 --> 00:08:09,744
was Eva Smith. - Eva Smith? 
- Yes.

125
00:08:10,217 --> 00:08:12,597
Do you remember her, 
mister Berling? - NooO

126
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:17,712
But I seem to remember having 
heard that name somewhere.

127
00:08:17,893 --> 00:08:20,322
Eva Smith.

128
00:08:20,733 --> 00:08:23,620
But it doesn't convey anything to me.

129
00:08:24,294 --> 00:08:26,875
I don't see where I 
come into this, inspector.

130
00:08:27,042 --> 00:08:30,352
But she was employed in your
works, Mister Birling.

131
00:08:30,509 --> 00:08:32,724
Oooh, that's it! Well, of course.

132
00:08:32,809 --> 00:08:36,381
We've got several hundred young 
women there. They keep changing.

133
00:08:36,623 --> 00:08:39,829
Ah, but this young woman Eva Smith 
was a bit out of the ordinary.

134
00:08:39,889 --> 00:08:43,041
I found a photograph of 
her in the lodgings.

135
00:08:44,051 --> 00:08:46,935
Perhaps, uh, perhaps this 
will help you to remember.

136
00:08:48,466 --> 00:08:50,411
Any particular reason 
why we shouldn't see this

137
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,885
 young woman's photograph, inspector?

138
00:08:52,105 --> 00:08:54,105
There might be.

139
00:08:54,744 --> 00:08:57,278
You recognize her now, 
don't you, Mister Berling?

140
00:08:57,704 --> 00:08:59,264
Yees!

141
00:08:59,968 --> 00:09:02,800
I remember her. 
She was one of my employees.

142
00:09:06,356 --> 00:09:08,971
It must've been the Autumn of 1910.

143
00:09:09,251 --> 00:09:12,411
About the time we opened 
our new machine shop.

144
00:09:13,192 --> 00:09:18,368
Yeah, she was out of the ordinary.
An intelligent, good-looking girl.

145
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:21,068
If fact, the foreman told 
me he was ready to 

146
00:09:21,108 --> 00:09:22,243
promote her to what they call a....

147
00:09:22,355 --> 00:09:24,486
a leading operator.

148
00:09:24,925 --> 00:09:30,303
Head of a small group of girls.
See them? Quite a bit of spirit.

149
00:09:34,659 --> 00:09:37,315
I didn't know then that 
she was a troublemaker.

150
00:09:39,341 --> 00:09:41,920
It's only the girls in the 
lath machine job isn't it?

151
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:44,207
Not the whole boiling? 
-Only the women, sir.

152
00:09:44,297 --> 00:09:45,520
How many of them are coming up?

153
00:09:45,598 --> 00:09:46,777
A deputation of five, sir.

154
00:09:46,857 --> 00:09:49,548
-Right, you'd better show 'em in. 
-Right, sir.

155
00:10:00,310 --> 00:10:03,604
I understand you're dissatisfied with 
the money you're getting here.

156
00:10:03,639 --> 00:10:05,714
Is that so? -Yes, sir.

157
00:10:05,749 --> 00:10:07,587
How much are they getting at the moment?

158
00:10:07,732 --> 00:10:09,745
Between 22 shillings and 
6 pence a week, sir.

159
00:10:09,988 --> 00:10:13,271
That's the usual rate in the industry 
at present, isn't it? -Yes, sir.

160
00:10:13,883 --> 00:10:15,359
You see?

161
00:10:15,822 --> 00:10:18,170
How much do you think you ought to get?

162
00:10:18,171 --> 00:10:21,950
25 shillings, sir.
- Well I'm sorry, but it can't be done.

163
00:10:22,170 --> 00:10:24,291
Why can't it be done?

164
00:10:24,664 --> 00:10:27,742
Did you say "Why can't it be done"?

165
00:10:29,178 --> 00:10:33,072
Yes. - I don't see why I should 
have to give you an explanation.

166
00:10:33,547 --> 00:10:38,069
Well why are you seeing us then?
- Alright, I'll tell you.

167
00:10:38,104 --> 00:10:40,856
If I agreed to your demands,
costs would go up 10%.

168
00:10:40,857 --> 00:10:43,559
And if costs went up 10% 
prices would go up 10%

169
00:10:43,594 --> 00:10:46,644
a we should be unable to sell our 
goods against our competitors

170
00:10:46,645 --> 00:10:48,645
If that happened the factory 
would close down and

171
00:10:48,694 --> 00:10:50,694
you'd be out of work.
Satisfied?

172
00:10:52,563 --> 00:10:53,706
No.

173
00:10:54,910 --> 00:10:57,644
I'm afraid you'll have 
to remain unsatisfied

174
00:10:57,679 --> 00:11:00,799
I've told you, we're 
paying the usual rates.

175
00:11:00,834 --> 00:11:03,002
But what if you can't live on them?

176
00:11:03,003 --> 00:11:06,666
You'll have to go and work somewhere 
else. It's a free country, after all.

177
00:11:06,667 --> 00:11:10,187
What's the use of that if you 
can't get work somewhere else?

178
00:11:10,602 --> 00:11:13,346
I'm sorry, but that's 
no concern of mine.

179
00:11:26,591 --> 00:11:30,269
There'll be trouble sir, I'm afraid.
- Oh, You mean they'll strike?

180
00:11:30,270 --> 00:11:34,479
I'm sure of it, sir. - Just back from
their holidays, aren't they? - Yes, sir.

181
00:11:35,006 --> 00:11:37,680
Yes, well it'll soon be over, 
they'll all be broke.

182
00:11:37,681 --> 00:11:40,205
As soon as they feel the pinch 
they'll be trying to come back.

183
00:11:40,225 --> 00:11:42,225
You'll take 'em back, sir?
- Yes, at the old rates.

184
00:11:43,795 --> 00:11:46,904
I won't accept the ringleaders,
that girl for instance.

185
00:11:46,905 --> 00:11:50,177
She had far too much to say for herself.
Get rid of her.

186
00:11:54,029 --> 00:11:57,969
So Eva Smith, together with 
4 or 5 others, was discharged.

187
00:11:58,471 --> 00:12:01,711
Is that why she killed herself?
- Don't be ridiculous, Eric.

188
00:12:01,723 --> 00:12:05,047
All this happened before you'd 
even started in the works.

189
00:12:05,048 --> 00:12:06,976
Nearly two years ago.

190
00:12:07,011 --> 00:12:10,080
It obviously had nothing to do with 
the wretched girl's suicide, inspector.

191
00:12:10,165 --> 00:12:12,165
I didn't say it was suicide.

192
00:12:12,528 --> 00:12:14,005
What're you suggesting?

193
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:16,150
I'm not suggesting anything, 
Mister Birling.

194
00:12:16,199 --> 00:12:20,245
I'm merely trying to trace the facts 
that led to the death of this girl.

195
00:12:20,246 --> 00:12:23,463
But good heavens man, 
I can't accept any responsibility!

196
00:12:23,464 --> 00:12:25,956
If we were all responsible 
for everything that

197
00:12:26,001 --> 00:12:28,784
happened to people that 
we'd had anything to do with...

198
00:12:28,889 --> 00:12:31,701
Well it would... It would 
be very awkward, wouldn't it?

199
00:12:32,703 --> 00:12:35,503
Oh yes, very awkward.

200
00:12:35,538 --> 00:12:37,418
In any case I can't see that 
in the circumstances

201
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:38,768
 you could've done anything else, sir.

202
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:41,880
Yes he could. He could've kept her 
on instead of throwing her out.

203
00:12:42,070 --> 00:12:44,029
I call it tough luck.
- Rubbish!

204
00:12:44,029 --> 00:12:47,758
If you don't come down sharply on them 
they'll soon be asking for the earth!

205
00:12:47,759 --> 00:12:49,112
Well why shouldn't they 
ask for higher wages? 

206
00:12:49,143 --> 00:12:50,732
We try for the highest possible prices!

207
00:12:50,811 --> 00:12:52,235
I don't see why she 
should've been sacked

208
00:12:52,272 --> 00:12:53,900
just because she had a bit 
more spur than the others!

209
00:12:54,125 --> 00:12:56,125
You said yourself she was a 
good worker. I'd have let her stay.

210
00:12:56,591 --> 00:12:59,018
Unless you brighten 
some of your ideas...

211
00:12:59,019 --> 00:13:03,899
you'll never be in a position to let 
anybody stay or to tell anybody to go!

212
00:13:06,424 --> 00:13:09,600
Well Inspector, there's 
nothing more I can tell you.

213
00:13:09,601 --> 00:13:12,578
I told the girl to clear it out and she 
went. That's the last I heard of her.

214
00:13:12,579 --> 00:13:15,739
Well have you got any ideas 
what happened to her after that?

215
00:13:15,954 --> 00:13:17,254
Get into trouble?

216
00:13:17,502 --> 00:13:19,946
Go on the streets? 
- No, no Mister Berling, 

217
00:13:20,014 --> 00:13:21,714
she didn't exactly 
go on the streets.

218
00:13:21,869 --> 00:13:24,237
Oh, sorry I didn't know 
you had someone with you.

219
00:13:24,238 --> 00:13:26,647
Alright, we'll be along in a 
minute, we're finished here.

220
00:13:26,648 --> 00:13:29,088
There nothing else, you 
know. I told you that.

221
00:13:29,451 --> 00:13:32,629
What's this all about? - Nothing to do 
with you Sheila, run along.

222
00:13:32,630 --> 00:13:35,677
Wait, please, Miss Birling.
- Now look here, inspector...

223
00:13:35,678 --> 00:13:38,062
There isn't the slightest reason 
why my daughter should be 

224
00:13:38,119 --> 00:13:40,134
dragged into this unpleasant business.

225
00:13:40,222 --> 00:13:42,047
What business?

226
00:13:42,082 --> 00:13:44,323
I'm a police inspector, Miss Berling.

227
00:13:44,626 --> 00:13:48,779
This afternoon a young woman drank 
some poison and died in the infirmary.

228
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:50,691
After great suffering, I'm afraid.

229
00:13:50,717 --> 00:13:54,019
How horrible! Was it an accident?
- That's what we want to find out.

230
00:13:54,071 --> 00:13:56,779
Yes, well don't tell me the girl 
commited suicide just because

231
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:59,862
 I dismissed her from my 
employment about two years ago.

232
00:14:00,384 --> 00:14:04,384
Well did you? - Yes I did.
She'd been causing trouble at the works.

233
00:14:04,419 --> 00:14:07,609
It was quite justified.
- I think you were.

234
00:14:07,610 --> 00:14:11,006
I wish you hadn't told me. What was 
she like? - Yes, what was she like?

235
00:14:11,007 --> 00:14:13,323
Quite young. 24.

236
00:14:13,358 --> 00:14:18,601
Pretty? - Not when I saw her today, 
Miss Berling, but she'd been pretty. Very pretty.

237
00:14:18,636 --> 00:14:21,603
I don't really see that this inquiry 
gets you anywhere, inspector.

238
00:14:21,655 --> 00:14:22,974
It's what happened to 
her since she left 

239
00:14:23,018 --> 00:14:25,713
Mister Berling's works that 
is important. - Obviously.

240
00:14:25,924 --> 00:14:28,004
And we can't help you there 
because we don't know.

241
00:14:28,005 --> 00:14:30,825
Are you quite sure you don't know?

242
00:14:30,879 --> 00:14:32,670
Are you suggesting that...

243
00:14:32,671 --> 00:14:35,871
One of them had something 
to do with this girl?

244
00:14:37,012 --> 00:14:41,549
Yes. - So you didn't come here 
just to see me then? - No.

245
00:14:41,584 --> 00:14:45,190
No, I'm afraid I'll have to ask 
you all a few more questions yet.

246
00:14:45,191 --> 00:14:47,075
Well I've told you all I know.

247
00:14:47,076 --> 00:14:51,396
So I'd be much obliged if you'd ask 
your questions and then clear it out.

248
00:14:54,501 --> 00:14:58,171
We were having a nice little 
family celebration here this evening.

249
00:14:58,765 --> 00:15:01,754
A nastiness you've made 
of it, haven't you?

250
00:15:03,069 --> 00:15:06,159
It is not of my making 
I assure you, Mister Birling.

251
00:15:08,614 --> 00:15:10,440
I don't understand, Inspector.

252
00:15:10,492 --> 00:15:13,098
You talk as if we were responsible 
for this poor girl's death.

253
00:15:13,453 --> 00:15:16,939
You seem to forget that we're respectable 
citizens and not criminals, you know.

254
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:20,720
Ah well, sometimes there isn't as 
much difference as one would think.

255
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:23,623
Indeed, if it were left to me I 
wouldn't know where to draw the line.

256
00:15:23,976 --> 00:15:26,537
Fortunately, 
it isn't left to you, is it?

257
00:15:26,538 --> 00:15:29,446
Very fortunately. 
I'll have to make inquiries.

258
00:15:30,332 --> 00:15:33,173
What happened to this girl 
after she left my father's works?

259
00:15:33,174 --> 00:15:35,160
Well she was out of work 
for a couple of months.

260
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:37,075
As you can imagine, 
she had a very distressing time.

261
00:15:40,465 --> 00:15:44,246
How terrible. - Then she had 
a wonderful stroke of luck.

262
00:15:45,353 --> 00:15:49,969
She was taken on in a shop. 
A good shop. Millwood's. - Millwood's

263
00:15:50,004 --> 00:15:53,748
Oh, we go there! I was there this 
afternoon for your benefit.

264
00:15:53,783 --> 00:15:57,853
She enjoyed working there,
she liked being amongst pretty clothes.

265
00:15:57,888 --> 00:16:01,348
It seems she felt that she 
was making a real fresh start.

266
00:16:01,552 --> 00:16:04,616
But after two months, they told her
she'd have to go.

267
00:16:04,616 --> 00:16:05,590
Not doing her work properly?

268
00:16:05,950 --> 00:16:09,254
No no, there was nothing wrong about 
the way she was doing her work.

269
00:16:09,328 --> 00:16:10,971
They admitted that.

270
00:16:11,058 --> 00:16:13,030
There must've been something wrong?

271
00:16:13,031 --> 00:16:18,266
No, no. All she knew was that a 
customer had complained about her

272
00:16:18,301 --> 00:16:20,810
and so she had to go.

273
00:16:21,878 --> 00:16:25,558
When was this?
- The end of january last year.

274
00:16:27,709 --> 00:16:29,949
What was this girl like?

275
00:16:30,036 --> 00:16:34,028
Well if you'll come over here 
Miss Birling, I'll show you.

276
00:16:46,491 --> 00:16:48,286
What's the matter Sheila?

277
00:16:49,177 --> 00:16:51,110
You knew it was me 
all the time didn't you?

278
00:16:51,190 --> 00:16:55,866
Well, I had an idea it might be.

279
00:16:55,866 --> 00:16:58,008
Did it make much difference to her?

280
00:16:58,009 --> 00:17:02,949
Yes, I'm afraid it did. You see, that was
 the last really steady job she had.

281
00:17:05,468 --> 00:17:10,188
So I'm really responsible?
- No, I wouldn't go as far as that.

282
00:17:10,223 --> 00:17:13,452
No more than your father, really.
- What'd you do, Sheila?

283
00:17:13,453 --> 00:17:15,014
What happened?

284
00:17:15,914 --> 00:17:18,413
I was in a filthy temper that afternoon.

285
00:17:18,912 --> 00:17:20,555
I'd been out shopping with mother.

286
00:17:26,285 --> 00:17:29,105
But I needed a new hat, 
so we went to Millwood's.

287
00:17:30,042 --> 00:17:32,858
I was determined to get 
my own way over that hat.

288
00:17:33,979 --> 00:17:36,928
The fact that I knew in my heart that 
mother was right and I was wrong made

289
00:17:36,929 --> 00:17:40,109
me even more obstinate and pigheaded.

290
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:48,764
This is the one I like best.
- Oh dear. It doesn't suit you at all.

291
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:51,596
Mother, you always say 
that when I choose something!

292
00:17:51,597 --> 00:17:55,405
Surely I'm old enough to know what
I want. - It's quite unsuitable.

293
00:17:55,406 --> 00:17:57,466
Pink ones are very much prettier.

294
00:17:57,467 --> 00:18:00,687
Quite charming when the 
assistant had it on just now.

295
00:18:00,814 --> 00:18:04,718
Why is it you girls always like things
that are much too old for you?

296
00:18:04,719 --> 00:18:08,279
You need a hat like that 
to suit your baby face.

297
00:18:08,354 --> 00:18:12,256
Still, if you think you know 
best, you'll have it dear.

298
00:18:12,291 --> 00:18:16,171
Only hurry up and make up your mind.
You can meet me in the tea lounge.

299
00:18:16,209 --> 00:18:18,824
Miss Francis,
I know it didn't look right

300
00:18:18,879 --> 00:18:20,258
but I don't think I was 
wearing it properly. 

301
00:18:20,355 --> 00:18:21,195
Can you show me, please?

302
00:18:21,195 --> 00:18:24,829
Yes, Miss Birling. I think it 
would look better like this.

303
00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:28,356
Allow me. No, I might 
disarrange your charming coiffure.

304
00:18:28,357 --> 00:18:30,746
Eva, put it on, will you?

305
00:18:34,370 --> 00:18:37,839
Yes, I knew it was alright. 
Give it to me!

306
00:18:38,151 --> 00:18:39,770
Come along!

307
00:18:50,216 --> 00:18:52,536
Alright I won't have this 
hat or any other!

308
00:18:53,086 --> 00:18:56,128
Oh but Miss Birling! - I'm not going to sit 
here trying on hats for your amusement!

309
00:18:56,129 --> 00:18:58,293
But I assure you...
- That girl was grinning her head off!

310
00:18:58,294 --> 00:19:00,526
Don't you teach them any manners?
- Eva, you wouldn't!

311
00:19:00,527 --> 00:19:03,617
No. I wasn't, and it isn't my fault.
- I'm going to report you for impertinence!

312
00:19:03,618 --> 00:19:04,840
Well I must say that's unfair!

313
00:19:05,075 --> 00:19:07,040
It's nothing of the sort, you know 
perfectly well you were being insolent!

314
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:08,070
I'm sorry if I made that 
impression madam,

315
00:19:08,070 --> 00:19:11,407
and I assure you nothing... - Don't just stand 
there Miss Francis, do something!

316
00:19:11,408 --> 00:19:12,070
Miss Birling, do you see anything wrong?

317
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:14,072
Yes. This girl has been abominably rude!

318
00:19:14,072 --> 00:19:16,417
And if she's still here the next time 
I come I'll walk straight out!

319
00:19:16,443 --> 00:19:18,143
Well, Miss Birling, I'm sure 
there must be some mistake...

320
00:19:18,219 --> 00:19:20,475
And once more or I'll ask my mother 
to close her account with you!

321
00:19:24,591 --> 00:19:26,615
It didn't seem anything
 very terrible at the time.

322
00:19:26,865 --> 00:19:29,545
Well of course it wouldn't, 
Miss Birling, at the time.

323
00:19:29,575 --> 00:19:32,390
 Well how could I know 
what it would lead to?

324
00:19:32,490 --> 00:19:34,749
If she'd been some miserable, 
plain little creature,

325
00:19:34,807 --> 00:19:36,529
I don't suppose I would've done it.

326
00:19:36,915 --> 00:19:40,094
She was very pretty, and... looked 
as if she could take care of herself

327
00:19:40,095 --> 00:19:43,405
In fact in kind of a way, you might 
be said to have been jealous of her?

328
00:19:44,395 --> 00:19:46,395
Yes I suppose I was...

329
00:19:47,375 --> 00:19:49,729
But if I could help her now,
believe me I would.

330
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:55,715
I'm sure you would, Miss Birling.
But you can't. It's a great pity. She's dead.

331
00:19:56,805 --> 00:19:58,295
It's a bit sick when you 
come to think of it.

332
00:19:58,295 --> 00:20:00,445
Oh, I know, I know, I never 
done anything like that before.

333
00:20:01,165 --> 00:20:03,165
And I'll never do it again to anyone!

334
00:20:03,928 --> 00:20:05,773
Why had this to happen?

335
00:20:05,808 --> 00:20:08,681
That's what I hope to find out 
before I leave here, Miss Birling!

336
00:20:08,682 --> 00:20:11,303
So far we've discovered that Eva Smith

337
00:20:11,304 --> 00:20:14,478
lost one job because she was
sacked out of hand by your father.

338
00:20:14,479 --> 00:20:16,035
Then she lost another one because... 

339
00:20:16,130 --> 00:20:19,846
Well, for reasons which you've 
just described Miss Birling.

340
00:20:19,846 --> 00:20:21,504
Now she had to start again.

341
00:20:21,505 --> 00:20:23,730
She was anxious to dissociate 
herself from the past, 

342
00:20:23,730 --> 00:20:25,805
so she changed her name to Daisy Renton.

343
00:20:25,958 --> 00:20:27,037
What?

344
00:20:27,726 --> 00:20:31,306
I said she changed her name
to Daisy Renton.

345
00:20:46,972 --> 00:20:48,854
Well, Gerald?

346
00:20:49,169 --> 00:20:50,745
Well what, Sheila?

347
00:20:51,852 --> 00:20:53,874
How did you come to know this girl?

348
00:20:53,874 --> 00:20:55,630
Eva Smith. - I didn't

349
00:20:55,730 --> 00:20:57,357
Or Daisy Renton, and 
it's the same thing.

350
00:20:57,357 --> 00:20:58,355
Why should I have known?

351
00:20:58,580 --> 00:21:03,852
Oh dear Gerald, you gave yourself away 
as soon as he mentioned her other name.

352
00:21:03,852 --> 00:21:07,049
Alright, I knew her. 
Let's leave it at that.

353
00:21:07,084 --> 00:21:08,635
I wish we could leave it at that 
- But Darling

354
00:21:08,635 --> 00:21:11,085
No, it's no use! You're not any 
newer, you knew her very well.

355
00:21:11,856 --> 00:21:14,356
Otherwise you wouldn't 
look so guilty about it.

356
00:21:16,654 --> 00:21:18,823
When did you first get to know her?

357
00:21:21,523 --> 00:21:23,942
Was it after she left Millwood's?

358
00:21:27,517 --> 00:21:29,445
Were you seeing her all 
last spring and summer

359
00:21:29,494 --> 00:21:32,054
during that time when you hardly came 
near me and said you were busy?

360
00:21:32,612 --> 00:21:33,868
Well were you?

361
00:21:34,203 --> 00:21:35,671
I'm sorry, Sheila.

362
00:21:36,123 --> 00:21:38,435
But the whole thing was over 
and done with last summer.

363
00:21:38,435 --> 00:21:40,945
I haven't set eyes on the girl 
for at least six months.

364
00:21:40,945 --> 00:21:42,475
We don't come into this business.

365
00:21:42,665 --> 00:21:44,225
Thought I didn't half an hour ago.

366
00:21:44,225 --> 00:21:46,315
You don't. Neither of us does.

367
00:21:46,807 --> 00:21:49,012
For heaven's sake, don't 
say anything to the inspector.

368
00:21:49,091 --> 00:21:50,680
About you and this girl? 
- Yes.

369
00:21:51,014 --> 00:21:54,985
He doesn't need to know.
- But he knows. Of course he knows.

370
00:21:55,467 --> 00:21:59,949
But I hate to think how much he knows 
that we don't know yet. For your sake.

371
00:22:00,027 --> 00:22:02,553
Yes, I agree. 
It's a very distressing story.

372
00:22:02,554 --> 00:22:06,795
But I must say, inspector, that it seems an 
extraordinary coincidence that my husband,

373
00:22:06,830 --> 00:22:10,824
and as you tell us, Sheila, should
both have come in contact with this girl.

374
00:22:10,825 --> 00:22:14,105
As you say, Missus Birling,
an extraordinary coincidence.

375
00:22:14,416 --> 00:22:16,290
Of course, now we know why you're here,

376
00:22:16,290 --> 00:22:19,056
we should only be too glad to 
answer any questions we can.

377
00:22:19,056 --> 00:22:22,048
Thank you. - But the rest of us, of 
course have never met the girl

378
00:22:22,049 --> 00:22:24,961
so I very much doubt if we
 should be of any great help to you.

379
00:22:24,962 --> 00:22:27,539
No mother, please. 
-Why whatever's the matter, Sheila?

380
00:22:27,574 --> 00:22:30,377
I know it sounds silly, but I feel
you're beginning all wrong.

381
00:22:30,378 --> 00:22:33,213
I'm afraid you'll do or say something
you'll be sorry for afterwards.

382
00:22:33,214 --> 00:22:35,274
I don't know what you're talking about.

383
00:22:36,060 --> 00:22:38,309
We all started like that.

384
00:22:38,428 --> 00:22:40,851
So confident,
so pleased with ourselves,

385
00:22:40,852 --> 00:22:43,432
until he began asking us questions.

386
00:22:43,741 --> 00:22:45,910
I don't understand about you.

387
00:22:45,945 --> 00:22:47,855
I don't know much 
about police inspectors,

388
00:22:47,855 --> 00:22:49,306
but I never imagined them like you.

389
00:22:49,306 --> 00:22:52,588
You seem to have made a great 
impression on this child, inspector.

390
00:22:52,589 --> 00:22:56,209
We often do in the young ones, Missus 
Birling. They're more impressionable.

391
00:22:56,735 --> 00:22:59,190
You're looking tired, dear. I
 think you ought to go to bed.

392
00:22:59,624 --> 00:23:02,664
I'm staying here until I know why
that girl killed herself.

393
00:23:02,665 --> 00:23:04,440
Morbid curiosity.

394
00:23:04,475 --> 00:23:06,760
In any case, I don't suppose for 
a moment we can understand

395
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:09,101
why she commited suicide. 
Girls of that class!

396
00:23:09,101 --> 00:23:12,902
No mother, for your own sake as well as 
ours, you mustn't... - Mustn't what?

397
00:23:12,954 --> 00:23:14,456
Really, Sheila!

398
00:23:14,491 --> 00:23:17,541
You musnt't start building up a wall
between us and that girl.

399
00:23:17,542 --> 00:23:19,630
If you do the inspector 
will just break it down,

400
00:23:19,630 --> 00:23:21,209
it'll be all the worse when he does.

401
00:23:21,209 --> 00:23:25,418
I don't understand you. Do you? - Yes.

402
00:23:25,909 --> 00:23:28,000
Yes. I'm afraid she's right.

403
00:23:28,273 --> 00:23:31,093
That I consider a trifle 
impertitent, inpector!

404
00:23:31,344 --> 00:23:34,140
I realize that you have to 
conduct some sort of inquiry,

405
00:23:34,141 --> 00:23:37,966
but I must say that so far you seem 
to be conducting it in a rather peculiar,

406
00:23:37,967 --> 00:23:39,669
and offensive manner.

407
00:23:40,251 --> 00:23:42,280
You realize of course 
that my husband was

408
00:23:44,577 --> 00:23:46,430
And that he's still a magistrate?

409
00:23:46,430 --> 00:23:48,475
Missus Birling, the 
inspector knows all that.

410
00:23:48,475 --> 00:23:51,015
As a magistrate, 
Missus Birling, your husband

411
00:23:51,015 --> 00:23:53,015
will want to take a lively 
interest in this inquiry.

412
00:23:53,394 --> 00:23:56,634
I'd be grateful for his help. Will he 
be returning shortly, do you think?

413
00:23:56,686 --> 00:23:58,996
He's just talking to my son Eric.

414
00:23:59,024 --> 00:24:01,611
He seems to be in a silly, 
excitable sort of mood.

415
00:24:01,675 --> 00:24:03,765
What's the Matter with him? -Eric?

416
00:24:04,470 --> 00:24:07,079
I'm afraid he may have had rather
too much to drink tonight.

417
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:12,420
We were... - Is he used to drinking?
- Of course not! He's only a boy.

418
00:24:12,657 --> 00:24:15,509
We're all boys to our 
mothers, Missus Birling.

419
00:24:15,544 --> 00:24:19,810
I'd say he's a young man.
- Some young men drink far too much.

420
00:24:19,811 --> 00:24:22,211
Are you insinuating that 
Eric is one of them?

421
00:24:22,246 --> 00:24:25,466
Mother, I'm the last person to say 
anything to hurt Eric, you know that

422
00:24:25,467 --> 00:24:28,321
What's the use of blindly 
shutting our eyes to the facts?

423
00:24:28,322 --> 00:24:30,627
But you, his own sister...
- Eric drinks too much

424
00:24:30,628 --> 00:24:34,509
It's no help to him merely to pretend 
that he doesn't. - But it isn't true!

425
00:24:34,510 --> 00:24:37,770
Gerald, you know him.
You know it isn't true.

426
00:24:39,257 --> 00:24:40,687
Well, Mister Croft?

427
00:24:40,722 --> 00:24:44,040
Well... lately he has been 
drinking rather a lot, but...

428
00:24:46,028 --> 00:24:49,224
And this is the moment 
you choose to tell me?

429
00:24:49,918 --> 00:24:54,198
I've been trying to persuade 
Eric to go to bed, but he won't.

430
00:24:54,212 --> 00:24:56,555
Now he says that you told him to wait. 

431
00:24:56,555 --> 00:25:00,044
Did you?
- Yes, yes I did. -Why?

432
00:25:00,044 --> 00:25:01,395
I want to talk to him.

433
00:25:01,396 --> 00:25:03,560
Well I suggest you do 
it now and get it over

434
00:25:03,605 --> 00:25:04,515
I'm sorry, I can't today.

435
00:25:04,515 --> 00:25:07,119
Now look here inspector...
- He must wait his turn.

436
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:09,991
I don't like your tone, or the way 
you're conducting this inquiry!

437
00:25:09,992 --> 00:25:13,112
I don't propose to give 
you much more rope.

438
00:25:13,221 --> 00:25:15,711
You needn't give me 
any rope, Mister Birling.

439
00:25:15,712 --> 00:25:17,512
Please father, please be careful!

440
00:25:17,547 --> 00:25:19,710
What is the matter with that girl?

441
00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:21,820
She's overexcited and 
behaving most stupidly.

442
00:25:21,992 --> 00:25:25,146
Now come along inspector,
what is it you want to know?

443
00:25:25,147 --> 00:25:27,975
Well Missus Birling, as I told you
Eva Smith had to leave Millwood's

444
00:25:27,976 --> 00:25:30,267
because your daughter compelled him
to discharge her.

445
00:25:30,268 --> 00:25:33,721
After that she stopped being Eva 
Smith and became Daisy Renton.

446
00:25:33,722 --> 00:25:35,630
When did you first get 
to know her, Mister Croft?

447
00:25:35,665 --> 00:25:37,378
Where did you get the 
idea that I did know her?

448
00:25:37,378 --> 00:25:40,288
No, it's no use, Gerald. 
- Alright.

449
00:25:40,323 --> 00:25:43,927
I met her first sometime in March 
last year at the palace theater.

450
00:25:43,928 --> 00:25:46,033
Sheila, are you sure 
you want to hear this?

451
00:25:46,034 --> 00:25:48,880
Why don't you leave us?
- Because I want to understand.

452
00:25:48,881 --> 00:25:53,501
Don't you see how important it is to 
both of us that I should understand?

453
00:25:57,296 --> 00:25:59,225
What's the matter, Mister Croft?

454
00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:01,425
Sorry, I suddenly realized...

455
00:26:02,105 --> 00:26:04,105
I'm taking it improperly 
that she's dead.

456
00:26:04,549 --> 00:26:06,703
Probably between us we killed her.

457
00:26:06,704 --> 00:26:08,500
Don't talk nonsense!

458
00:26:08,535 --> 00:26:11,274
Go on, Mister Croft. You met her 
at the Palace variety theater.

459
00:26:11,275 --> 00:26:14,548
I'd seen the only act I wanted to see,
and that was bad

460
00:26:14,549 --> 00:26:16,183
so I went down to 
the bar to get a drink.

461
00:26:16,184 --> 00:26:19,909
The Palace bar has, I understand, 
an unsavoury reputation.

462
00:26:20,465 --> 00:26:24,592
Yes, it's the favorite front of uh,
women of a certain sort.

463
00:26:24,627 --> 00:26:28,923
Women of a certain sort?
Here in Bromley?

464
00:26:29,330 --> 00:26:33,508
Yes, Missus Birling. I'm afraid that even 
Bromley is not entirely free from...

465
00:26:33,509 --> 00:26:35,736
from that sort of thing.

466
00:26:36,207 --> 00:26:38,865
I think it would be better if Sheila 
didn't listen to this at all.

467
00:26:38,955 --> 00:26:40,955
I'm determined to listen to it, mother. 
I explained why.

468
00:26:43,511 --> 00:26:44,996
Go on, Gerald.

469
00:26:45,031 --> 00:26:47,295
You went down into the bar...

470
00:27:55,073 --> 00:27:59,171
I take it you're not a friend of Gerald Maggoteth?
- Gerald Maggoteth? - No, obviously not.

471
00:27:59,172 --> 00:28:01,356
That was the amorous gentleman
you were talking to.

472
00:28:01,357 --> 00:28:05,181
He seemed part of a man before me.
He just came and sat down.

473
00:28:05,182 --> 00:28:07,115
How on earth did you 
get in such a place?

474
00:28:07,116 --> 00:28:11,130
I came to see the manager to bite a job.
He told me to wait there.

475
00:28:11,131 --> 00:28:13,554
And the manager didn't come?

476
00:28:13,589 --> 00:28:17,088
No. Did you know him?
- Slightly.

477
00:28:17,123 --> 00:28:19,350
Would you like me to 
try and find him for you?

478
00:28:20,852 --> 00:28:22,559
Sure, you want the job then?

479
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:26,785
No, no not in there.
Selling programs or something.

480
00:28:26,820 --> 00:28:30,463
Ah, I see. You stay here and I'll try
and find him for you.

481
00:28:37,526 --> 00:28:38,804
What's the matter?

482
00:28:39,124 --> 00:28:42,244
Nothing. I'm alright.
- Come and sit down.

483
00:28:47,124 --> 00:28:52,364
Are you ill? 
- No, I'm alright. It's just...

484
00:28:53,540 --> 00:28:56,832
I think perhaps I may be a tiny bit 
faint, and it's been getting to me...

485
00:28:57,338 --> 00:29:00,518
How many meals have you had today?
- Oh, I've had a lot of meals.

486
00:29:01,090 --> 00:29:02,548
What'd you have for lunch?

487
00:29:03,491 --> 00:29:05,373
Dinner? What'd you have for dinner?

488
00:29:05,374 --> 00:29:07,185
I had dinner alright. - What?

489
00:29:07,776 --> 00:29:08,783
WHAT?

490
00:29:09,162 --> 00:29:12,000
Well, I....
- You had no dinner.

491
00:29:12,035 --> 00:29:14,955
Come on now, be honest.
You had no dinner, now did you?

492
00:29:15,113 --> 00:29:17,475
No, I suppose not really.
- And breakfast?

493
00:29:18,174 --> 00:29:20,453
Oh yes, I had breakfast. - What?

494
00:29:22,092 --> 00:29:24,303
I had a cup of tea.
- A cup of tea!?

495
00:29:25,170 --> 00:29:27,230
Here, take my arm.

496
00:29:29,898 --> 00:29:31,189
Oh. Thank you.

497
00:29:32,750 --> 00:29:34,855
Where're you taking me to?
- Come on.

498
00:29:38,956 --> 00:29:40,917
That was wonderful. 
- What would you like now?

499
00:29:40,918 --> 00:29:43,041
Nothing, thank you. - A knife?
- No thank you.

500
00:29:43,042 --> 00:29:44,612
Coffee? - No really, I couldn't.

501
00:29:44,613 --> 00:29:46,043
The bill please, waiter.

502
00:29:46,530 --> 00:29:48,625
You know, you must've been 
a terribly bad cad

503
00:29:48,750 --> 00:29:50,750
 to have to get sacked from 
both your jobs so quickly.

504
00:29:50,789 --> 00:29:52,318
Perhaps I was.

505
00:29:53,227 --> 00:29:55,095
No, I don't think I was.

506
00:29:55,130 --> 00:29:58,070
I sure you weren't.
It was just bad luck.

507
00:29:58,420 --> 00:30:00,780
Perhaps it was.
- What'd you do then?

508
00:30:00,796 --> 00:30:04,242
Ooh, nothing very much. 
A few odd things, I managed.

509
00:30:04,243 --> 00:30:07,244
Were you born in Bromley?
- No, I was born in the country.

510
00:30:07,245 --> 00:30:09,329
My father worked on a farm.

511
00:30:09,330 --> 00:30:12,341
I lived there 'till I was fifteen.
I loved it there, the country.

512
00:30:12,342 --> 00:30:15,962
Why did you leave?
- I wanted to better myself.

513
00:30:24,876 --> 00:30:27,293
Oh, oh I'm so sorry.

514
00:30:27,727 --> 00:30:30,049
I don't know why I feel so sleepy.

515
00:30:30,050 --> 00:30:33,490
It's horrid of me when you've
been so nice to me.

516
00:30:33,819 --> 00:30:36,539
Not a bit. It's the food and the wine.

517
00:30:36,712 --> 00:30:40,908
I'll see you home. - Oh, no it doesn't 
matter though, really. - Oh yes it does!

518
00:30:40,909 --> 00:30:42,509
Wouldn't want any more 
Alderman Maggoteths.

519
00:30:42,510 --> 00:30:43,726
Come on.

520
00:30:53,067 --> 00:30:55,947
I've never been in a cab before.

521
00:30:58,528 --> 00:31:01,509
Well, when you're a very old lady
you'll be able to tell your grandchildren.

522
00:31:01,510 --> 00:31:04,001
March the 18th, 1911.

523
00:31:04,346 --> 00:31:07,854
You'll say, 
"That's the day I travelled in a cab"

524
00:31:07,854 --> 00:31:10,535
Teehee. With the famous Gerald Croft.

525
00:31:10,570 --> 00:31:13,086
The old Croft of Bromley by then.

526
00:31:13,087 --> 00:31:15,527
This is Osmand Street, sir. 
Any particular number?

527
00:31:15,704 --> 00:31:18,324
What number, Daisy?
- Oh, this'll do beautifully.

528
00:31:28,385 --> 00:31:30,205
Good night Gerald, and thank you.

529
00:31:30,206 --> 00:31:32,262
I said I was going to see you to
your front door and I meant it.

530
00:31:32,263 --> 00:31:34,711
Now, which house is it?
- No, don't bother, I'm alright.

531
00:31:34,712 --> 00:31:36,695
I insist on bothering. 
I don't leave a lady

532
00:31:36,695 --> 00:31:38,502
standing in the street 
in the middle of the night.

533
00:31:38,502 --> 00:31:40,122
Now what is the number?

534
00:31:40,357 --> 00:31:42,964
Well I don't really live on 
Osmand street itself, it's

535
00:31:43,427 --> 00:31:46,126
it's just around the corner. Good night.

536
00:31:46,126 --> 00:31:48,295
I said I was gong to 
see you to your front door.

537
00:31:48,455 --> 00:31:50,556
Will you wait there, cabbie? 
- Bravo, sir.

538
00:31:56,927 --> 00:32:00,392
Is this the corner? - No, the next one.

539
00:32:06,621 --> 00:32:09,418
Gerald, don't come with me!
- But why not?

540
00:32:10,225 --> 00:32:13,511
Well....
Daisy, tell me the truth.

541
00:32:14,698 --> 00:32:18,153
Well I... I don't really exactly 
live anywhere at the moment...

542
00:32:18,591 --> 00:32:21,451
I was hoping to stay 
with a friend of mine.

543
00:32:29,982 --> 00:32:33,252
I was turned out of my room,
I couldn't pay the rent.

544
00:32:33,253 --> 00:32:35,633
I was hoping to stay with a girl I knew.

545
00:32:35,889 --> 00:32:39,182
It's too late now, I can't wake up 
the house at this time of night.

546
00:32:39,183 --> 00:32:42,830
But I'll be perfectly alright. 
It'll be getting light soon, and...

547
00:32:42,830 --> 00:32:44,900
I'll just walk around...

548
00:32:45,787 --> 00:32:47,549
Thank you Gerald. Goodbye.

549
00:32:54,025 --> 00:32:56,243
Will you wait a moment please, cabbie?
- Alright, sir.

550
00:32:58,700 --> 00:33:00,718
Now I'll tell you what actually 
is going to happen.

551
00:33:00,753 --> 00:33:03,845
We live, my family and I, in 
the country about 15 miles out, 

552
00:33:03,845 --> 00:33:05,844
so I keep a little flat here in Bromley.

553
00:33:05,844 --> 00:33:08,604
It's yours until you get 
fixed up with another place.

554
00:33:09,787 --> 00:33:12,210
When I say yours, I mean yours.

555
00:33:12,245 --> 00:33:14,488
I shan't arrive unless I'm invited.

556
00:33:18,611 --> 00:33:20,621
You really mean that?
- Yes.

557
00:33:20,656 --> 00:33:22,344
What do you say?

558
00:33:25,952 --> 00:33:28,252
Cabbie, will you drive to 
7 Arcride Terrace, please?

559
00:33:38,403 --> 00:33:41,460
That, madam, is I think all 
I need tell you about this...

560
00:33:41,555 --> 00:33:43,302
desirable residence.

561
00:33:43,302 --> 00:33:47,042
It has of course constant cold water,
and every modern inconvenience.

562
00:33:47,942 --> 00:33:50,959
Ah, here's the keys. 
'A' is for this door here,

563
00:33:50,994 --> 00:33:53,233
and 'B' is for the door downstairs.

564
00:33:55,889 --> 00:33:58,575
Here're two sovereigns 
for housekeeping money.

565
00:33:58,576 --> 00:34:00,163
Oh, but I couldn't!

566
00:34:00,198 --> 00:34:02,878
The flat must be kept up to its 
accustomed style of living, Miss Renton.

567
00:34:02,879 --> 00:34:05,439
Now, go and get 12 hours of sleep.

568
00:34:05,837 --> 00:34:08,359
Look at this, we might consider the 
possibility of three square meals a day

569
00:34:08,394 --> 00:34:09,907
not forgetting tea.

570
00:34:09,907 --> 00:34:10,750
hahahahahaha

571
00:34:12,521 --> 00:34:15,474
Would you be coming here tomorrow? 
-Yes, we'll have dinner together.

572
00:34:15,590 --> 00:34:17,057
I'll be here a 7 sharp.

573
00:34:17,057 --> 00:34:18,039
Thank you.

574
00:34:19,025 --> 00:34:20,358
Good night.

575
00:34:21,533 --> 00:34:23,122
Good night.

576
00:34:41,788 --> 00:34:45,796
Miss Daisy Renton, I believe? - Quite right. 
Would you be Mister Gerald Croft?

577
00:34:45,797 --> 00:34:48,557
Not if I could possibly be anyone else

578
00:34:48,968 --> 00:34:51,183
Can't talk until I get rid of this.

579
00:34:54,256 --> 00:34:56,575
- What is it?
- You'll see.

580
00:34:57,634 --> 00:35:01,521
Chicken, ham, fruit, everything.

581
00:35:01,965 --> 00:35:03,468
And a bottle of wine.

582
00:35:03,513 --> 00:35:05,141
Now, plates.

583
00:35:06,864 --> 00:35:08,086
Hello, what's this?

584
00:35:09,854 --> 00:35:13,134
I thought we'd eat here too.

585
00:35:13,222 --> 00:35:16,687
But this is wonderful!
We'll have two courses, a banquet!

586
00:35:22,723 --> 00:35:26,364
You know what you've forgotten? 
Corkscrew.

587
00:37:04,753 --> 00:37:07,643
My hat, look at the time!
I've gotta go.

588
00:37:07,644 --> 00:37:09,944
I shall only just catch that last train!

589
00:37:10,865 --> 00:37:13,706
I have to run for it. Good night, Daisy.

590
00:37:14,827 --> 00:37:16,294
Goodnight.

591
00:37:38,190 --> 00:37:39,948
And so she became your mistress?

592
00:37:39,949 --> 00:37:41,475
I suppose it was inevitable.

593
00:37:41,491 --> 00:37:42,660
Were you in love with her?

594
00:37:42,695 --> 00:37:44,725
I object to my daughter, a 
young, unmarried girl,

595
00:37:44,785 --> 00:37:46,073
being drawn into this affair.

596
00:37:46,073 --> 00:37:50,153
Your daughter isn't living on the moon, 
mother, she's here in Bromley.

597
00:37:50,333 --> 00:37:52,133
Were you in love with her?

598
00:37:54,770 --> 00:37:56,180
It's hard to say.

599
00:37:56,415 --> 00:37:59,326
I suppose I didn't feel about her 
the way she did about me.

600
00:37:59,327 --> 00:38:02,324
Of course not. 
You were the wonderful fairy prince.

601
00:38:02,325 --> 00:38:06,004
You must've adored it, Gerald.
- Yes, I admit it.

602
00:38:06,039 --> 00:38:08,830
I did for a time.
Almost any man would've.

603
00:38:08,831 --> 00:38:11,745
That's about the best thing that 
anyone's said here tonight.

604
00:38:11,745 --> 00:38:13,694
 At least it's honest.

605
00:38:13,694 --> 00:38:15,114
Thank you, Gerald.

606
00:38:20,703 --> 00:38:22,945
Is there anything else you 
ought to know, inspector?

607
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:26,413
I don't think we want to know more 
details of this... disgusting affair.

608
00:38:26,447 --> 00:38:30,120
I'm afraid I do, Missus Berling. I'll have to 
know the rest of the story, Mister Croft.

609
00:38:30,121 --> 00:38:33,776
I've proceeded, I imagine, 
along more or less conventional lines.
- Conventional?

610
00:38:33,777 --> 00:38:36,280
There were no particular incidents. 
I supported her,

611
00:38:36,325 --> 00:38:37,587
though she would never
accept much money.

612
00:38:37,587 --> 00:38:40,864
We were never seen together 
in Bromley. She insisted on that.

613
00:38:40,865 --> 00:38:45,585
But I saw her pretty 
frequently at the flat...

614
00:38:49,170 --> 00:38:51,470
Have you been out somewhere?
- Yes.

615
00:38:52,477 --> 00:38:53,577
Theater.

616
00:38:55,802 --> 00:38:58,983
Was it good?
- It was alright.

617
00:39:05,834 --> 00:39:07,806
What'd you do today?

618
00:39:14,878 --> 00:39:17,520
Daisy, I don't know how to 
tell you this, but I...

619
00:39:17,575 --> 00:39:19,575
I've simply got to talk to you.

620
00:39:19,602 --> 00:39:21,628
No, don't you talk.

621
00:39:22,162 --> 00:39:24,884
It's impossible for you, 
let me do the talking.

622
00:39:27,387 --> 00:39:29,627
Just tell me if I go wrong.

623
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:32,926
Daisy, this isn't fair!
- No, leave it to me.

624
00:39:35,431 --> 00:39:40,476
This's got to end.
It's wrong for both of us.

625
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:43,502
It's better.

626
00:39:45,073 --> 00:39:47,830
You were never really in love with me, 
you know, just...

627
00:39:48,324 --> 00:39:51,897
just sorry for me, 
and that's not quite the same thing.

628
00:39:53,102 --> 00:39:55,037
And perhaps...

629
00:39:55,558 --> 00:39:58,878
I was never really in love with you.

630
00:39:59,187 --> 00:40:01,804
Just very grateful.

631
00:40:02,301 --> 00:40:05,469
I've always known it would 
have to end, so it's no shock.

632
00:40:05,470 --> 00:40:08,346
even when we were happiest 
together having fun,

633
00:40:08,381 --> 00:40:11,894
I was always a little unhappy too, it's 
because I knew it would have to end.

634
00:40:11,929 --> 00:40:14,518
The only thing I didn't know was when.

635
00:40:19,081 --> 00:40:20,821
Have you found someone else?

636
00:40:21,833 --> 00:40:24,158
Yes.
- Then I must leave tomorrow.

637
00:40:24,159 --> 00:40:28,577
You don't have to go as quickly as-
- No, I'll go tomorrow. She might find 
out I was here

638
00:40:28,578 --> 00:40:32,323
I'll pack and go as soon as I 
possibly can. - Please stop it, Daisy.

639
00:40:32,324 --> 00:40:35,899
I know you're only trying to make 
it easier  for me, but it's horrible.

640
00:40:37,215 --> 00:40:40,537
I'll leave some money for you.
- No, no, I don't need any money.

641
00:40:40,572 --> 00:40:42,525
Please take it Daisy,
I couldn't bear it if you didn't.

642
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:45,221
It's just something to keep you 
going until you get a decent job.

643
00:40:45,256 --> 00:40:47,705
Oh, don't worry about me. 
I'll get a job.

644
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:49,920
- You sure?
- Yes, I'm quite sure.

645
00:40:50,667 --> 00:40:52,830
Goodbye Gerald, please go quickly now.

646
00:40:54,551 --> 00:40:56,612
No, no. Please.

647
00:41:29,152 --> 00:41:30,656
I'm afraid that's all I can tell you.

648
00:41:30,689 --> 00:41:32,731
Thank you, Mister Croft. 
That's all I want from you.

649
00:41:32,884 --> 00:41:35,395
In that case, if you'll excuse me,
I'd be glad if you'd let me go.

650
00:41:35,395 --> 00:41:38,787
Go where, home? - No, I'd like to walk 
around a bit if you don't mind.

651
00:41:38,787 --> 00:41:40,376
Certainly Mister Croft 
- Gerald.

652
00:41:41,476 --> 00:41:43,239
I think you'd better take this.

653
00:41:45,427 --> 00:41:47,792
I see. 
- Oh, don't misunderstand me.

654
00:41:47,793 --> 00:41:50,733
I don't dislike you as 
I did half an hour ago.

655
00:41:51,211 --> 00:41:55,460
In fact in some odd way I rather respect 
you more than I've ever done before.

656
00:41:56,094 --> 00:41:58,274
But this has made a difference.

657
00:41:58,309 --> 00:42:01,769
You and I aren't the same people 
who sat down to dinner here.

658
00:42:02,220 --> 00:42:04,440
We shall have to get to know 
each other all over again.

659
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:11,279
but you must understand that a lot of 
young men... - No father, please.

660
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:15,148
Gerald knows what I mean.
- Yes, I know what you mean.

661
00:42:15,723 --> 00:42:21,192
But I'm coming back, if I may.
- You may.

662
00:42:27,377 --> 00:42:30,387
Well, let's hope that disposes of the 
unfortunate girl.

663
00:42:30,388 --> 00:42:33,270
I'm afraid not quite, Missus Birling.

664
00:42:33,830 --> 00:42:36,489
You never showed that 
photograph to Gerald, inspector.

665
00:42:36,490 --> 00:42:38,126
It wasn't necessary.

666
00:42:39,198 --> 00:42:41,880
Is that a photograph of the girl? - Yes.

667
00:42:42,546 --> 00:42:44,666
I think you'd better have a look at her.

668
00:42:46,180 --> 00:42:48,720
You recognize her?
- No, why should I?

669
00:42:50,272 --> 00:42:52,208
You mean you don't choose to?

670
00:42:52,209 --> 00:42:54,437
I meant what I said.

671
00:42:55,799 --> 00:42:59,932
You're not telling me the truth, 
Missus Birling. - I beg your pardon!

672
00:42:59,967 --> 00:43:01,843
Now look here, inspector...

673
00:43:02,078 --> 00:43:05,151
I won't have this!
I'm a public man!

674
00:43:05,386 --> 00:43:07,000
I suggest, Mister Birling, 
that public men 

675
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,380
have responsibilities 
as well as priviliges.

676
00:43:09,453 --> 00:43:11,325
Yes, but you weren't told to come here

677
00:43:11,325 --> 00:43:13,461
 to talk to me about 
my responsibilities.

678
00:43:13,461 --> 00:43:15,899
Let's hope not,
but I'm beginning to wonder.

679
00:43:15,900 --> 00:43:17,513
Does that meaning anything, Sheila?

680
00:43:17,514 --> 00:43:20,323
It means that we've no excuse now
for putting on airs.

681
00:43:20,324 --> 00:43:23,200
Father threw this girl out because 
she asked for decent wages.

682
00:43:23,201 --> 00:43:26,583
I did no such thing! I sacked her 
because she was a troublemaker!

683
00:43:26,584 --> 00:43:28,111
Well anyways, she was sacked.

684
00:43:28,112 --> 00:43:31,224
I pushed her further out because I was 
in a bad temper, and she was pretty

685
00:43:31,225 --> 00:43:34,198
Gerald gives her the earth and then 
drops her as soon as it suits him

686
00:43:34,199 --> 00:43:37,077
And now you're pretending you don't
recognize her for herself!

687
00:43:37,078 --> 00:43:39,521
Sheila, how dare do you! - Oh, I admit 
I know why you should, but I

688
00:43:39,522 --> 00:43:41,620
do very well know that you did 
from the way you look!

689
00:43:41,621 --> 00:43:44,746
Can't you see that 
you're just making tours?

690
00:43:44,747 --> 00:43:47,737
It's the door again.
- Gerald must've come back.

691
00:43:47,738 --> 00:43:50,426
Unless your son has just gone out.
- Well I'll go and see.

692
00:43:50,427 --> 00:43:54,305
Missus Birling, you are a member,
a very prominent member of the

693
00:43:54,420 --> 00:43:56,420
Blumley women's charity 
organization, aren't you?

694
00:43:56,872 --> 00:43:59,239
Yes, I am. - And it's an organization 
to which women

695
00:43:59,585 --> 00:44:01,585
in distress may appeal 
for help in various forms?

696
00:44:02,274 --> 00:44:06,112
Yes, we've done a great deal of
work in helping deserving cases.

697
00:44:06,113 --> 00:44:08,960
And there was a meeting of the 
interviewing commitee, two weeks ago?

698
00:44:09,285 --> 00:44:10,870
I daresay there was.

699
00:44:10,870 --> 00:44:13,755
You know very well there was, 
Missus Birling. You were in the chair!

700
00:44:13,790 --> 00:44:16,956
And if I was?
What business is it of yours?

701
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:19,760
Was it Eric? - Must've been.

702
00:44:20,080 --> 00:44:23,776
Did you go up to his room? 
- Yes. And I called out on both landings.

703
00:44:23,777 --> 00:44:27,773
Must've gone out. - Silly boy,
where could he have gone to? - Can't imagine.

704
00:44:27,774 --> 00:44:32,016
He's in one of his excitable moods.
Anyway, we don't need him here

705
00:44:32,025 --> 00:44:34,025
Oh, but we do need him here.

706
00:44:34,071 --> 00:44:37,326
He's probably gone to cool off.
- I'm sure he'll be back soon.

707
00:44:37,327 --> 00:44:42,045
You're sure? - Reasonably sure.
- He'll be back. - I hope so.

708
00:44:42,533 --> 00:44:44,187
Why should you hope so?

709
00:44:44,188 --> 00:44:47,408
I'll explain that when you've answered 
my questions, Missus Birling.

710
00:44:48,057 --> 00:44:50,500
You remember that Mister Croft 
told us, quite truthfully I believe,

711
00:44:50,515 --> 00:44:52,515
 that he hadn't spoken to or 
seen Eva Smith for the last 6 months

712
00:44:53,340 --> 00:44:56,353
But Missus Birling spoke to her 
and saw her only two weeks ago.

713
00:44:56,354 --> 00:44:59,807
Mother did? 
- Is this true?

714
00:45:00,373 --> 00:45:04,387
Yes, quite true. - She appealed to 
your organization for help.

715
00:45:04,388 --> 00:45:07,895
Yes. - Did you give it? - No. - Why?

716
00:45:10,104 --> 00:45:11,697
Why, Missus Birling?

717
00:45:11,732 --> 00:45:14,465
She told me ridiculous, 
incredible story.

718
00:45:14,466 --> 00:45:17,600
An obvious lie. 
Also, she was grossly impertinent. 

719
00:45:17,700 --> 00:45:18,908
Impertinent? - Yes.

720
00:45:18,908 --> 00:45:22,293
That was one of the reasons that
prejudiced me against her case.

721
00:45:22,294 --> 00:45:24,363
You admit being prejudiced against her?

722
00:45:24,364 --> 00:45:28,784
Yes. -Mother, she's just died 
a horrible death. -I'm very sorry.

723
00:45:29,041 --> 00:45:31,050
I think she had only herself to blame.

724
00:45:31,085 --> 00:45:32,515
Tell me, was it due to your influence 

725
00:45:32,515 --> 00:45:33,865
as the most prominent 
member of the committee

726
00:45:33,865 --> 00:45:36,185
that help was refused this girl?
- Possibly.

727
00:45:36,185 --> 00:45:40,600
Come now Missus Birling.
Was it or was it not your influence?

728
00:45:42,071 --> 00:45:44,532
I didn't like her manner.
- Why did she ask for help?

729
00:45:44,533 --> 00:45:47,187
You know very well why 
she asked for help. - No I didn't.

730
00:45:47,944 --> 00:45:50,656
I know that she needed help,
but if I wasn't there

731
00:45:50,657 --> 00:45:52,310
then I don't know why she asked
it from your committee.

732
00:45:52,328 --> 00:45:55,673
I don't think we need to discuss it.

733
00:45:55,708 --> 00:45:58,707
You have no hope of not 
discussing it, Missus Birling.

734
00:45:58,742 --> 00:46:01,320
If you think you can bring any 
pressure to bear upon me, inspector,

735
00:46:01,425 --> 00:46:02,966
you're very much mistaken.

736
00:46:02,966 --> 00:46:05,731
Unlike the other three, I have 
nothing that I'm ashamed of

737
00:46:05,732 --> 00:46:08,172
or that won't bear investigation.

738
00:46:08,562 --> 00:46:10,275
This girl asked for assistance.

739
00:46:10,276 --> 00:46:13,336
We are required to look very carefully
into the claims made upon us.

740
00:46:13,337 --> 00:46:15,637
I wasn't satisfied 
with this girl's tale.

741
00:46:15,638 --> 00:46:18,159
It seemed to me that 
she was not a good case.

742
00:46:18,768 --> 00:46:21,230
so I used my influence
to have it refused.

743
00:46:21,231 --> 00:46:25,484
In spite of what's happened since,
I still think that I did my duty.

744
00:46:25,485 --> 00:46:28,231
So if I don't choose 
to discuss it any further,

745
00:46:28,266 --> 00:46:31,706
you have no power to 
make me change my mind.

746
00:46:32,139 --> 00:46:35,460
I'm afraid I have that power, 
Missus Birling.

747
00:46:35,470 --> 00:46:37,028
No you have not!

748
00:46:37,062 --> 00:46:40,155
Simply because I've done 
nothing wrong, and you know it!

749
00:46:40,190 --> 00:46:44,411
If you've done nothing wrong, why
are you afraid to discuss it, Missus Birling?

750
00:46:44,412 --> 00:46:47,830
How dare you say I'm afraid.

751
00:46:47,865 --> 00:46:50,866
(Under the) circumstances 
I consider I was perfectly justified!

752
00:46:50,867 --> 00:46:55,290
The girl told us a pack of lies.
Made me lose all patience with her.

753
00:46:55,291 --> 00:46:58,573
She claimed elaborate, fine feelings

754
00:46:58,608 --> 00:47:02,928
and scruples, simply absurd in
a girl in that position.

755
00:47:03,450 --> 00:47:06,152
She gave herself ridiculous airs.

756
00:47:06,689 --> 00:47:09,972
She'd no ridiculous airs 
when I saw her last.

757
00:47:09,973 --> 00:47:11,582
In the infirmary.

758
00:47:12,053 --> 00:47:15,273
Come now, Miss Birling. Let's have 
some facts. Facts, please!

759
00:47:15,300 --> 00:47:17,414
There was a meeting of the commitee
with yourself in the chair

760
00:47:17,415 --> 00:47:19,677
to which this girl appealed 
for help, isn't that so?

761
00:47:19,678 --> 00:47:21,400
Yes.
-Under what name?

762
00:47:21,435 --> 00:47:23,435
Not as Eva Smith?
- No.

763
00:47:23,435 --> 00:47:26,351
Nor as Daisy Renton.
- As what, then?

764
00:47:26,665 --> 00:47:28,071
Missus Birling.

765
00:47:29,075 --> 00:47:31,278
What did you say?
- Pardon?

766
00:47:31,823 --> 00:47:34,303
You called yourself 
Missus Birling just now.

767
00:47:35,416 --> 00:47:38,575
I'm sorry? - That's not your 
husband's name, is it?

768
00:47:40,600 --> 00:47:43,155
No. -But you know that it is mine?

769
00:47:44,980 --> 00:47:48,793
No! - If you come here for the express 
purpose of being impertinent...

770
00:47:49,297 --> 00:47:52,405
No. It was the first name I thought of.

771
00:47:52,598 --> 00:47:54,573
I worked at Birling's once.

772
00:47:54,574 --> 00:47:56,454
What is your husband's name.

773
00:47:58,461 --> 00:47:59,991
I can't say.

774
00:48:00,401 --> 00:48:02,544
You can't say!

775
00:48:02,890 --> 00:48:05,130
In fact, you're not 
married at all, are you?

776
00:48:06,564 --> 00:48:07,738
No.

777
00:48:08,217 --> 00:48:12,997
So your whole story about a husband
who deserted you is quite false, isn't it?

778
00:48:13,615 --> 00:48:14,974
Yes.

779
00:48:16,780 --> 00:48:18,746
Tissue of lies.

780
00:48:19,192 --> 00:48:21,541
Have you tried to get work?

781
00:48:21,542 --> 00:48:24,293
I can't get work.
- Why not?

782
00:48:25,035 --> 00:48:26,185
I can't say.

783
00:48:26,475 --> 00:48:30,011
If you don't confide in us
 we can't help you, can we?

784
00:48:30,011 --> 00:48:32,071
Now, why can't you work?

785
00:48:32,714 --> 00:48:34,459
I'm going to have a baby.

786
00:48:36,974 --> 00:48:38,740
Come along, my dear.

787
00:48:39,544 --> 00:48:42,517
You must sit down. 
There are plenty of chairs.

788
00:48:43,260 --> 00:48:45,496
Sit down now.
-Thank you m'am

789
00:48:45,712 --> 00:48:47,710
There are certain circumstances

790
00:48:47,710 --> 00:48:50,800
in which it is prudent to be 
seated as much as possible.

791
00:48:51,452 --> 00:48:56,476
May we now proceed, Missus Livson?
- Oh, do.

792
00:49:00,126 --> 00:49:03,255
Now, this man. Why must 
you lie about him?

793
00:49:03,340 --> 00:49:05,321
I didn't want to bring him into it.

794
00:49:05,321 --> 00:49:06,292
Why not?

795
00:49:06,845 --> 00:49:10,315
He didn't mean any harm, he was
just silly and wild.

796
00:49:10,687 --> 00:49:12,763
Sometimes he drank too much.

797
00:49:13,024 --> 00:49:14,448
Why don't you make him marry you?

798
00:49:14,449 --> 00:49:16,825
In my opinion you should be 
compelled to marry him.

799
00:49:16,826 --> 00:49:19,397
It isn't that he won't marry 
me, we just couldn't.

800
00:49:19,398 --> 00:49:21,052
We're not of the same class.

801
00:49:21,252 --> 00:49:22,933
This's ridiculous...

802
00:49:23,354 --> 00:49:27,342
A girl in your position can't 
afford these fine airs and scruples.

803
00:49:27,343 --> 00:49:29,471
You don't mind coming 
begging for charity,

804
00:49:29,472 --> 00:49:32,244
why not go to this drunken 
young idler, whoever he is?

805
00:49:32,245 --> 00:49:33,925
Make him support you.

806
00:49:33,933 --> 00:49:35,735
He did. He gave me money.

807
00:49:35,736 --> 00:49:37,766
And now he won't give you anymore?

808
00:49:38,706 --> 00:49:41,106
He would, but I can't take it.

809
00:49:42,316 --> 00:49:44,385
This young ne'er-do-well,

810
00:49:44,420 --> 00:49:46,520
because of your high-falutin' notions,

811
00:49:46,553 --> 00:49:49,007
is to escape the 
consequences of his actions,

812
00:49:49,025 --> 00:49:52,600
and shift hist responisbility onto a 
charitable organization such as this.

813
00:49:53,126 --> 00:49:55,771
I think the members of this 
committee will agree with me

814
00:49:55,823 --> 00:49:57,919
that it would be monstrous 
were I to recommend

815
00:49:57,921 --> 00:50:00,345
the expenditure of our 
funds in such a way.

816
00:50:01,071 --> 00:50:04,506
In my opinion he should 
be publicly exposed.

817
00:50:04,507 --> 00:50:06,687
If you want help, young woman,

818
00:50:06,945 --> 00:50:08,769
go to him.

819
00:50:11,237 --> 00:50:15,548
So I think I was perfectly justified in advising 
my committee not to allow her claim.

820
00:50:15,549 --> 00:50:17,289
And you still think that?

821
00:50:17,319 --> 00:50:20,339
I'm sorry she should've come to 
such a horrible end, but

822
00:50:20,795 --> 00:50:23,530
I accept no blame for it at all.

823
00:50:23,531 --> 00:50:26,695
Tell me who, who do you say
is to blame, then?

824
00:50:27,211 --> 00:50:29,443
First, the girl herself.

825
00:50:29,478 --> 00:50:32,297
By letting father and me have her
chucked out of her jobs?

826
00:50:32,298 --> 00:50:34,188
Secondly, I blame the young man.

827
00:50:34,445 --> 00:50:36,400
He ought to be dealt with very severely.

828
00:50:36,401 --> 00:50:39,718
If the girl's death is due to anybody,
then it's due to him.

829
00:50:39,719 --> 00:50:44,941
Ah, then he's the chief 
culprit anyhow? - Certainly.

830
00:50:44,976 --> 00:50:48,793
In that case, he's responsible for the 
whole thing. The girl's death, everything.

831
00:50:48,827 --> 00:50:50,417
He ought to be dealt with very severely.

832
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:53,358
Mother, please stop. - You're behaving 
like a hysterical child, my Sheila.

833
00:50:53,410 --> 00:50:55,415
And if you would take steps 
to find this young man,

834
00:50:55,435 --> 00:50:57,086
make him admit his responsibilities

835
00:50:57,101 --> 00:50:59,768
instead of staying here and asking 
quite unnecessary questions,

836
00:50:59,769 --> 00:51:01,970
then you really would 
be doing your duty.

837
00:51:02,753 --> 00:51:05,666
Don't worry Missus Birling,
I'll do my duty.

838
00:51:05,667 --> 00:51:10,095
Now perhaps you'd like to 
say goodnight. - Not yet. I'm waiting.

839
00:51:10,670 --> 00:51:14,779
Waiting? For what?
- To do my duty.

840
00:51:25,218 --> 00:51:27,377
Oh mother, can't you see?

841
00:51:35,906 --> 00:51:39,169
Are you suggesting... My boy....

842
00:51:39,675 --> 00:51:43,815
If it was, Missus Birling, we know 
what to do. You just told us.

843
00:51:45,270 --> 00:51:48,719
Yes, but.... Look here, inspector!

844
00:51:52,201 --> 00:51:54,761
Mother, I begged and begged you to stop.

845
00:51:59,368 --> 00:52:01,225
I don't believe it.

846
00:52:02,184 --> 00:52:03,994
I won't believe it.

847
00:52:04,029 --> 00:52:06,494
Come in, Mister Birling.
 - What?

848
00:52:06,529 --> 00:52:07,830
I think I heard your son come in.

849
00:52:07,860 --> 00:52:09,860
I didn't hear anything.

850
00:52:11,177 --> 00:52:13,091
Oh, yes. There he is.

851
00:52:14,326 --> 00:52:15,379
Eric.

852
00:52:24,685 --> 00:52:25,815
You know, don't you?

853
00:52:25,815 --> 00:52:28,815
I don't know anything.

854
00:52:32,155 --> 00:52:33,528
Not anymore.

855
00:52:33,545 --> 00:52:36,645
Mother's been blaming everything on 
the young man who got this girl into trouble.

856
00:52:36,645 --> 00:52:39,449
Saying you shouldn't escape, and
should be made an example of.

857
00:52:39,467 --> 00:52:40,924
That's enough, Sheila.

858
00:52:40,959 --> 00:52:43,313
You haven't made it any easier for me,
have you, mother?

859
00:52:43,738 --> 00:52:45,924
You're not like that!

860
00:52:47,016 --> 00:52:49,274
Mother, what's the use of pretending?

861
00:52:49,309 --> 00:52:50,940
If you had any sense of loyalty you...

862
00:52:50,950 --> 00:52:52,540
Father, you don't have 
to talk to Sheila like that.

863
00:52:52,540 --> 00:52:53,720
Hold your tongue!

864
00:52:53,753 --> 00:52:56,230
I've had about enough.
- One moment please.

865
00:52:56,265 --> 00:52:59,277
You'll have plenty of time to adjust
family relationships after I've gone.

866
00:52:59,329 --> 00:53:01,312
Because now, Mister Birling, 
I'd like to ask your son 

867
00:53:01,310 --> 00:53:03,700
about his association 
with Eva Smith.

868
00:53:04,490 --> 00:53:07,000
Sheila, take your mother 
into the dining room.

869
00:53:07,075 --> 00:53:09,001
Father, I want to hear-
- You heard what I said.

870
00:53:09,599 --> 00:53:11,389
Go on Sibil.

871
00:53:22,255 --> 00:53:23,900
Could I have a drink first?

872
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,000
No you don't!
- Yes.

873
00:53:26,022 --> 00:53:29,675
I know I know, this is your house 
and he's your son, but look at him.

874
00:53:29,676 --> 00:53:33,768
This is one time he needs a drink.
- Alright, go on.

875
00:53:34,354 --> 00:53:36,794
Now when did you first meet this girl?

876
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:40,458
It was one night last winter.

877
00:53:41,195 --> 00:53:44,714
I'd been out with some of the 
chaps, I was a bit squiffy, I...

878
00:53:44,715 --> 00:53:46,875
It was late but I didn't 
want to go home.

879
00:53:46,876 --> 00:53:49,515
So for some reason I don't 
know why I, I got on a tram.

880
00:53:49,520 --> 00:53:51,710
Nevermind about trams, go on!

881
00:53:52,390 --> 00:53:53,430
Fares, please.

882
00:53:54,209 --> 00:53:55,249
Fares, please.

883
00:54:03,052 --> 00:54:05,756
How much? - Well that depends on 
how far you're going, doesn't it?

884
00:54:05,791 --> 00:54:09,043
Not too far. We mustn't overdo it.

885
00:54:09,078 --> 00:54:10,650
That's nice, but you're the one 
that's been overdoing it.

886
00:54:10,662 --> 00:54:12,168
Come on, we'll call 
it toppence then.

887
00:54:12,237 --> 00:54:14,811
Yes. Yes that's very reasonable.

888
00:54:16,122 --> 00:54:19,287
Here you are, and I want 19 and
10 pence of change.

889
00:54:19,322 --> 00:54:21,882
Well I haven't got 19 and 10 pence.
Stop trying to make a fool of me.

890
00:54:21,883 --> 00:54:26,036
I've had a long day. Either pay your
fare or get off my tram.

891
00:54:26,037 --> 00:54:28,447
I am trying to pay my fare, 
and you won't let me.

892
00:54:28,448 --> 00:54:30,368
Right, I'm putting you 
off the next stop.

893
00:54:30,369 --> 00:54:31,483
Fares, please.

894
00:54:34,872 --> 00:54:37,432
Two tickets please, I'll pay his fare.

895
00:54:42,691 --> 00:54:47,085
You know, that was extraordinarily 
kind of you. If I give you this

896
00:54:47,102 --> 00:54:50,765
No, I haven't got 19 and ten pence 
change either. It doesn't matter.

897
00:54:50,765 --> 00:54:54,451
Of course it matters. It's just these
little things that do matter.

898
00:54:56,409 --> 00:54:59,813
By the way, where are we?
- Turning into Elmerbridge Road.

899
00:54:59,848 --> 00:55:01,215
This is where I get out.

900
00:55:01,495 --> 00:55:05,799
So do I. I always get out 
somewhere on Elmerbridge Road.

901
00:55:05,799 --> 00:55:07,248
That's just silly.

902
00:55:17,433 --> 00:55:20,825
No madam, I insist. This's the only 
place open here where I can get change

903
00:55:20,825 --> 00:55:23,110
and pay my debt. And I have no doubt

904
00:55:23,110 --> 00:55:26,437
I have no doubt that we shall find
something very very delicious to eat.

905
00:55:26,454 --> 00:55:28,733
You're hungry, I'm hungry...

906
00:55:28,734 --> 00:55:30,631
And you're hungry? -Yes.

907
00:55:30,632 --> 00:55:33,634
Yes, well there you see, 
everybody's hungry! Except him.

908
00:55:33,669 --> 00:55:34,430
Hello my good friend!

909
00:55:34,560 --> 00:55:37,625
Now just a minute, I want to
see if I got this shipping order right.

910
00:55:37,625 --> 00:55:38,853
Now, let's have it again.

911
00:55:38,888 --> 00:55:41,368
????????????????,
???????????????????,

912
00:55:41,372 --> 00:55:43,794
two penny worth of chip four times and

913
00:55:43,811 --> 00:55:44,970
here's your money.

914
00:55:45,568 --> 00:55:47,108
Now, what's yours?

915
00:55:47,526 --> 00:55:49,801
Goodnight, princess.

916
00:55:50,201 --> 00:55:52,345
I shall have 8 penny worth of them both.

917
00:55:52,346 --> 00:55:54,447
That guarantees me the 
right kind of change.

918
00:55:54,465 --> 00:55:56,481
'Birling the Businessman', they call me.

919
00:55:56,482 --> 00:55:58,907
Oh, you are Mister Birling?
- Eric, but that too.

920
00:55:58,959 --> 00:56:00,699
I worked there once.

921
00:56:00,750 --> 00:56:01,723
Did you?

922
00:56:02,160 --> 00:56:03,913
I work there now.

923
00:56:03,914 --> 00:56:06,287
Well what happened to you?
- I got the sack.

924
00:56:06,288 --> 00:56:08,177
Hmm, they didn't have a sack for me
where I slept.

925
00:56:08,212 --> 00:56:11,555
And I'm so bored all day that I have to
go out with the boys at night

926
00:56:11,555 --> 00:56:13,835
otherwise I'd go balmy.

927
00:56:13,835 --> 00:56:15,926
Yes of course I am a balmy
I just don't know it.

928
00:56:15,927 --> 00:56:16,430
Here you are.

929
00:56:16,605 --> 00:56:19,758
Ah, your tuppence, thank 
you very, very much.

930
00:56:19,758 --> 00:56:23,908
And now with the compliments of the
Birling esquire some delicious chish and fips.

931
00:56:23,909 --> 00:56:26,046
And now, I shall see you home.

932
00:56:27,047 --> 00:56:28,586
I shall see you home!

933
00:56:30,109 --> 00:56:32,916
Good night, monsieur de restauranteur!

934
00:56:33,316 --> 00:56:35,521
Well I'll say you are balmy!

935
00:56:43,178 --> 00:56:44,519
Well, this is it.

936
00:56:46,390 --> 00:56:47,950
Well if you don't mind me saying so,

937
00:56:51,429 --> 00:56:54,166
Now you go home like a good boy.
Good night.

938
00:56:54,167 --> 00:56:57,586
But I'm not a good boy.
I'm a bad boy.

939
00:56:57,769 --> 00:57:00,122
Eric, or little bundle.

940
00:57:00,770 --> 00:57:02,890
Well give me a kiss, then I'll go home.

941
00:57:04,244 --> 00:57:06,837
Alright, then. Just one.

942
00:57:09,171 --> 00:57:12,216
Now off you go, you'll get wet soon.

943
00:57:12,251 --> 00:57:15,115
You know, you've disappointed me.

944
00:57:15,904 --> 00:57:18,374
I'm very, very sad.

945
00:57:19,136 --> 00:57:21,023
You really must go home.

946
00:57:21,962 --> 00:57:23,702
I'll tell you a secret.

947
00:57:25,442 --> 00:57:27,702
I don't go home.

948
00:57:28,484 --> 00:57:29,860
Not yet.

949
00:57:30,779 --> 00:57:32,839
I must sober up first.

950
00:57:34,912 --> 00:57:37,326
I really ought to have something to eat.

951
00:57:37,361 --> 00:57:41,025
Because I'm very hungry, it's cold,
and I'm tired, and...

952
00:57:42,002 --> 00:57:43,914
It's wet.

953
00:57:44,378 --> 00:57:48,578
And a nice girl wouldn't turn a dog
away on a night like this.

954
00:57:49,975 --> 00:57:51,351
Alright then,

955
00:57:51,785 --> 00:57:53,145
but do be good.

956
00:57:53,777 --> 00:57:55,877
Try to be sensible.

957
00:57:59,080 --> 00:58:01,172
I won't breathe.

958
00:58:05,965 --> 00:58:08,273
And so you stayed for a hour or two
- Yes.

959
00:58:08,308 --> 00:58:11,015
And then you met her again. -Yes.
In fact you met her lots of... -Yes!

960
00:58:11,016 --> 00:58:15,036
Until one night she told you
that something had happened.

961
00:58:15,381 --> 00:58:16,428
Yes.

962
00:58:16,463 --> 00:58:18,477
What did she tell you had happened?

963
00:58:18,478 --> 00:58:21,818
Oh for heaven's sake, 
leave me alone, all of you!

964
00:58:25,843 --> 00:58:27,783
Oh don't you start on me too!

965
00:58:28,165 --> 00:58:31,359
Eric! - Oh stop it, stop it 
I tell you! All of you!

966
00:58:35,966 --> 00:58:37,740
What did she tell you?

967
00:58:38,184 --> 00:58:40,215
Come on boy, out with it!

968
00:58:40,814 --> 00:58:42,578
What is it, Eric?

969
00:58:47,274 --> 00:58:49,673
No, I couldn't be mistaken.

970
00:58:51,882 --> 00:58:54,560
Sorry Eric, but I'm quite sure.

971
00:58:57,222 --> 00:59:01,082
I'm glad you said that.
I was hoping you would.

972
00:59:01,123 --> 00:59:04,863
But I can't marry you Eric,
it wouldn't be right.

973
00:59:05,340 --> 00:59:07,224
You see, you don't love me,

974
00:59:08,008 --> 00:59:09,906
you were lonely.

975
00:59:10,542 --> 00:59:13,090
So was I, that's all 
it ever amounted to.

976
00:59:14,808 --> 00:59:17,208
No, I don't know what I'm gonig to do.

977
00:59:18,159 --> 00:59:20,026
But you haven't got any money.

978
00:59:20,854 --> 00:59:22,485
How?

979
00:59:24,905 --> 00:59:27,949
Promise me you won't do anything silly.

980
00:59:27,950 --> 00:59:30,340
I know you don't want 
to let me down, but

981
00:59:30,390 --> 00:59:32,390
you mustn't do anything stupid.

982
00:59:50,471 --> 00:59:52,314
Oh, hello boy. Got no work to do?

983
00:59:52,315 --> 00:59:55,235
Yes I have, father... - Well, you'd 
better get on with it, haven't you?

984
00:59:56,291 --> 00:59:58,410
I wanted to talk to you 
about something though.

985
00:59:58,427 --> 01:00:00,672
I'm very busy just now, can't it wait?

986
01:00:01,487 --> 01:00:04,558
It's rather urgent, I'm afraid.
- Well, well, what is it?

987
01:00:05,897 --> 01:00:07,680
Come to ask you for a rise, father.

988
01:00:07,680 --> 01:00:10,434
A rise? Good heavens boy, 
you're getting 30 bob a week!

989
01:00:10,434 --> 01:00:14,285
What more do you want at your age?
- I'm 25.

990
01:00:15,414 --> 01:00:18,512
Other chaps my age get 
more than that. Gerald, for instance.

991
01:00:18,513 --> 01:00:21,319
Yes, well Gerald's a good deal older
and a good deal more responsible.

992
01:00:21,320 --> 01:00:25,446
Anyway, I don't like to see young men
having a lot of money to waste.

993
01:00:25,447 --> 01:00:29,127
I can't manage on it, father.
- Can't manage on it?

994
01:00:29,162 --> 01:00:31,640
You've got nothing to spend 
it on as far as I can see

995
01:00:31,675 --> 01:00:34,237
you live at home, you've got everything
-I've got debts, father

996
01:00:34,237 --> 01:00:35,592
Debts?

997
01:00:36,115 --> 01:00:39,174
Well let me tell you something. I'm not
going to pay your debts or anybody else's

998
01:00:39,175 --> 01:00:40,843
You can save up and pay your own debts.

999
01:00:40,844 --> 01:00:43,798
Or tell whoever you owe the 
money to to whistle and wait for it.

1000
01:00:45,067 --> 01:00:48,590
It's a matter of honour, father.
- Oh, so that's it, is it?

1001
01:00:48,590 --> 01:00:51,813
A debt of honour? Betting, horses, eh?

1002
01:00:51,848 --> 01:00:53,200
Well I'll tell you something else!

1003
01:00:53,315 --> 01:00:54,985
I'm not gonna hand 
over this firm's money

1004
01:00:54,985 --> 01:00:57,003
to a lot of bookmakers and that's flat!

1005
01:00:57,003 --> 01:00:59,545
You got into this mess, 
and you'll get out of it!

1006
01:00:59,565 --> 01:01:00,807
And it'll teach you a good lesson!

1007
01:01:00,807 --> 01:01:04,402
We'll talk about that rise when you've
learned a bit of common sense!

1008
01:02:11,060 --> 01:02:14,722
Well? Come on, out with it!

1009
01:02:20,828 --> 01:02:22,708
I was the father of the child, so

1010
01:02:23,806 --> 01:02:26,233
it was up to me to stand by her
as best I could.

1011
01:02:26,234 --> 01:02:27,868
What did you do?

1012
01:02:27,903 --> 01:02:29,854
I gave her some money, 
as I said I would.

1013
01:02:29,855 --> 01:02:31,244
How much?

1014
01:02:31,279 --> 01:02:35,313
A suppose about 50 pounds, all told.
- 50 pounds!?

1015
01:02:35,677 --> 01:02:38,886
Where did you get 50 pounds from!?
- From the office, father.

1016
01:02:38,920 --> 01:02:40,266
From my office!?
- Yes.

1017
01:02:40,266 --> 01:02:41,195
You stole it!

1018
01:02:41,195 --> 01:02:43,350
No, I went around to one or two
of the firm's small debtors and

1019
01:02:43,515 --> 01:02:44,687
collected their accounts in cash and

1020
01:02:44,713 --> 01:02:46,479
 gave them the receipt without 
a carbon copy in the book.

1021
01:02:46,667 --> 01:02:49,817
Pocketed the money! Pinched it!
- Not really.

1022
01:02:50,351 --> 01:02:53,263
I intended to pay it back
- And you will pay it back.

1023
01:02:53,740 --> 01:02:57,100
You'll pay it back if you work for 
nothing for the rest of your life!

1024
01:02:57,665 --> 01:03:02,320
50 pounds! I've a very good 
mind to give you in charge!

1025
01:03:02,979 --> 01:03:05,060
I'm not sure it rests 
with you, Mister Birling.

1026
01:03:05,060 --> 01:03:07,021
Your son may have commited 
a criminal offense.

1027
01:03:07,021 --> 01:03:08,183
Criminal...

1028
01:03:09,447 --> 01:03:10,940
You mean...

1029
01:03:10,975 --> 01:03:14,324
Police courts? Papers?

1030
01:03:15,038 --> 01:03:16,815
No, inspector! No!

1031
01:03:17,780 --> 01:03:20,489
That's scarcely your attitude of 
a few minutes ago, Missus Birling.

1032
01:03:21,633 --> 01:03:25,793
Why didn't you come to me when 
you found yourself in this mess?

1033
01:03:27,122 --> 01:03:30,158
Because you're the last person in the world 
anyone could go to when they're in trouble.

1034
01:03:30,159 --> 01:03:32,234
Your trouble is that 
you're being spoiled!

1035
01:03:32,235 --> 01:03:35,152
You can divide the responsibility
between you after I've gone.

1036
01:03:35,153 --> 01:03:38,310
Now, the girl really knew that 
the money you were giving her

1037
01:03:38,380 --> 01:03:40,380
 was stolen, didn't she? -Yes.

1038
01:03:41,457 --> 01:03:43,307
Yes, that was the worst part.

1039
01:03:43,308 --> 01:03:47,868
She wouldn't take any more 
and she didn't want to see me again.

1040
01:03:47,988 --> 01:03:49,705
But how did you know 
that, did she tell you?

1041
01:03:49,705 --> 01:03:51,725
No. No, I never spoke to her.

1042
01:03:52,248 --> 01:03:54,560
She told mother.
- Sheila!

1043
01:03:54,880 --> 01:03:55,425
Well he has to know.

1044
01:03:55,425 --> 01:03:58,724
She told you? When did she come here?

1045
01:03:58,759 --> 01:04:01,538
Well don't just stand there, tell me!
Tell me what happened!

1046
01:04:01,539 --> 01:04:02,876
I'll tell you.

1047
01:04:02,911 --> 01:04:07,991
She applied to your mother's committee for help
and your mother refused that help.

1048
01:04:08,764 --> 01:04:10,644
Then you killed her!

1049
01:04:11,184 --> 01:04:14,254
She came to you to protect me,
and you turned her away!

1050
01:04:14,255 --> 01:04:18,949
You killed her! And the child!
My child!

1051
01:04:18,949 --> 01:04:20,650
You killed them both!

1052
01:04:20,905 --> 01:04:23,905
Eric, please! I didn't understand.

1053
01:04:23,984 --> 01:04:27,804
You don't understand anything.
You never did! - Eric, don't!

1054
01:04:28,566 --> 01:04:30,556
Please.

1055
01:04:34,176 --> 01:04:38,766
Inspector,
is there bound to be an inquiry?

1056
01:04:41,213 --> 01:04:43,380
Or can all this be forgotten?

1057
01:04:43,381 --> 01:04:45,814
People have short 
memories, Mister Birling.

1058
01:04:46,878 --> 01:04:51,477
I'm not likely to forget it.
- No. No, I don't think you will.

1059
01:04:54,367 --> 01:04:56,647
You needn't look at me,
I know I shan't.

1060
01:04:56,648 --> 01:04:58,405
I started it.

1061
01:04:58,405 --> 01:05:03,045
No, No I don't think we can quite 
say that you started it, Miss Birling.

1062
01:05:03,096 --> 01:05:04,992
Can we, Mister Birling?

1063
01:05:05,855 --> 01:05:08,996
Inspector, I'll... I'll give thousands.

1064
01:05:09,031 --> 01:05:12,789
Yes, thousands. - You're offering 
money at the wrong time, father.

1065
01:05:15,619 --> 01:05:19,660
It isn't only Eva Smith, father.
It's all the other Eva Smiths.

1066
01:05:20,187 --> 01:05:23,072
The things we do to people without
realizing it.

1067
01:05:23,395 --> 01:05:25,875
Only for once we've 
seen the consequences.

1068
01:05:26,880 --> 01:05:30,740
Yes, I was rather hoping one of 
you would say something like that.

1069
01:05:32,101 --> 01:05:34,926
I suppose if we all knew the 
consequences beforehand

1070
01:05:34,961 --> 01:05:38,281
we'd all be a bit more careful,
eh Missus Birling?

1071
01:05:38,929 --> 01:05:42,448
But it's a pity that so often
something horrible has to happen

1072
01:05:42,483 --> 01:05:44,903
before we see some things at all.

1073
01:05:45,456 --> 01:05:48,260
Do you know that not one of 
you is the same person that you were 

1074
01:05:48,260 --> 01:05:50,267
when I first came here tonight?

1075
01:05:50,267 --> 01:05:53,766
Well now... I wonder 
where I left my hat?

1076
01:05:53,801 --> 01:05:58,665
I think I saw it in the dining 
room, Arthur. - Yes, that's right.

1077
01:05:58,700 --> 01:06:00,620
Thank you, Missus Berling.

1078
01:06:03,335 --> 01:06:04,710
Thank you.

1079
01:06:09,058 --> 01:06:12,049
Eric! - Sheila, please! I don't 
think I can stand anymore tonight.

1080
01:06:12,050 --> 01:06:17,690
I only want to say how sorry I 
am about you and that girl. - Thank you.

1081
01:06:22,179 --> 01:06:25,093
We've never been much of a brother
and sister before, have we?

1082
01:06:28,203 --> 01:06:30,476
Things change, I suppose.

1083
01:06:32,204 --> 01:06:34,184
I can change.

1084
01:06:34,219 --> 01:06:37,438
Stop drinking, take my punishment
over the money.

1085
01:06:37,439 --> 01:06:39,187
Try and pay it back somehow.

1086
01:06:39,188 --> 01:06:43,306
Nobody really cares about the money
anymore, it's you I'm thinking of.

1087
01:06:43,307 --> 01:06:47,603
Don't let it make you feel bitter about
father and mother. Don't let it Eric.

1088
01:06:47,638 --> 01:06:52,465
Alright. But you mustn't feel like
that about Gerald, either.

1089
01:06:52,466 --> 01:06:56,669
I don't any longer, not really.
- Because he's in love with you, you know.

1090
01:06:57,432 --> 01:06:59,868
And you are with him, aren't you?

1091
01:06:59,903 --> 01:07:02,050
I was very much, but...

1092
01:07:02,085 --> 01:07:05,445
after hearing about him and that girl...
- That doesn't matter.

1093
01:07:05,446 --> 01:07:08,955
Gerald's alright. Well I know he puts on
the grand Croft manner sometimes

1094
01:07:08,955 --> 01:07:10,831
but he's alright behind it all.

1095
01:07:10,831 --> 01:07:13,873
You know that, don't you?
- Yes.

1096
01:07:26,218 --> 01:07:27,845
Good evening, Mister Croft.

1097
01:07:27,880 --> 01:07:30,683
Oh, it's you Sergeant.
Good evening.

1098
01:07:30,718 --> 01:07:33,062
Everything alright, sir?
- Yes.

1099
01:07:33,063 --> 01:07:36,459
Yes, everything's fine.
Taking a stroll before I turn in.

1100
01:07:36,494 --> 01:07:41,530
Looks like a change in the weather, sir.
- Yes. Well, I'd better be going.

1101
01:07:41,565 --> 01:07:47,909
By the way, Sergeant, what sort of 
a fellow is this Inspector Poole? - Poole?

1102
01:07:47,944 --> 01:07:50,905
Which division, sir?
Well, here is Bromley.

1103
01:07:50,905 --> 01:07:52,960
There's no Inspector Poole in Bromley, Sir.

1104
01:07:52,960 --> 01:07:55,153
Are you certain?
- Positive, sir.

1105
01:07:55,736 --> 01:07:58,110
You couldn't be mistaken, could you?

1106
01:07:58,110 --> 01:08:00,180
I mean, there couldn't be 
a new man transferred here

1107
01:08:00,240 --> 01:08:01,272
 that you didn't know anything about?

1108
01:08:01,272 --> 01:08:03,891
Impossible, Sir. I would've heard of it
down at the station.

1109
01:08:04,525 --> 01:08:08,645
No, you can rest assured there 
is no Inspector Poole in Bromley.

1110
01:08:22,146 --> 01:08:23,640
Is the inspector still here?

1111
01:08:23,640 --> 01:08:26,289
Inspector? What inspector?
- Oh, of course you don't know, do you.

1112
01:08:26,289 --> 01:08:28,002
They're all in the dining room, sir.

1113
01:08:28,037 --> 01:08:29,608
Goodbye, Missus Birling.

1114
01:08:34,780 --> 01:08:36,591
Goodbye, Miss Birling.

1115
01:08:39,421 --> 01:08:40,805
Good night, Mister Croft.

1116
01:08:40,806 --> 01:08:42,355
Just a moment, inspector.

1117
01:08:42,356 --> 01:08:44,817
Something has happened, and I
must speak to Mr and Mrs Birling.

1118
01:08:44,818 --> 01:08:46,585
Do you mind waiting?

1119
01:08:47,141 --> 01:08:50,948
Not at all Mister Croft, but it 
won't make any difference, you know.

1120
01:08:54,292 --> 01:08:57,329
Well, Mister Birling, where 
would you like me to wait? - Wait?

1121
01:08:58,741 --> 01:09:00,461
Well...

1122
01:09:00,999 --> 01:09:04,784
Would you mind waiting in my study?
- Certainly.

1123
01:09:11,994 --> 01:09:12,865
Thank you Mister Birling.

1124
01:09:13,310 --> 01:09:15,145
Will you take a seat?

1125
01:09:21,968 --> 01:09:25,602
You know something?
- That man isn't a police officer!

1126
01:09:27,047 --> 01:09:30,104
What!? - Are you certain? 
- Absolutely!

1127
01:09:30,638 --> 01:09:32,447
But how did you find out?

1128
01:09:32,482 --> 01:09:35,544
I met a policeman I know down the road 
and I asked him about the inspector

1129
01:09:35,545 --> 01:09:37,834
He swore there was no Inspector Poole
on the force here.

1130
01:09:37,835 --> 01:09:40,189
By dingle, a fake! - Yes!

1131
01:09:40,804 --> 01:09:45,218
I knew a real inspector would 
never have spoken to me like that.

1132
01:09:45,219 --> 01:09:48,903
Yes, and look at the way he talked to me too,
ordering me about in my own house!

1133
01:09:48,903 --> 01:09:53,285
He must've know I was an 
ex-Lord Mayor and a magistrate!

1134
01:09:53,285 --> 01:09:55,362
I mean, real inspectors 
just don't talk like that.

1135
01:09:55,397 --> 01:09:57,987
You were right, he wasn't real.
There's no such inspector.

1136
01:09:57,988 --> 01:09:59,189
We've been had.

1137
01:09:59,827 --> 01:10:03,648
I just can't believe it.
- Well there's no doubt about it.

1138
01:10:05,260 --> 01:10:08,195
This makes a difference, you know.

1139
01:10:08,195 --> 01:10:10,376
I suppose we're all nice people now?

1140
01:10:10,376 --> 01:10:12,835
If you've got nothing more 
sensible to say than that Sheila,

1141
01:10:12,915 --> 01:10:14,089
you'd better keep quiet.

1142
01:10:14,089 --> 01:10:17,180
She's right, though. - Yes, and 
you'd better keep quiet anyhow.

1143
01:10:19,162 --> 01:10:22,222
You'd better know Gerald, 
I stole some money.

1144
01:10:22,448 --> 01:10:24,310
And you'll pay back.

1145
01:10:24,345 --> 01:10:25,625
Oh, the money's not important,

1146
01:10:25,720 --> 01:10:27,720
it's what happened to the girl and 
what we all did to her that matters!

1147
01:10:27,720 --> 01:10:30,555
Harry's absolutely right. Just 
remember what that inspector said.

1148
01:10:30,555 --> 01:10:34,115
But he's not an inspector!
- Well he inspected us all right!

1149
01:10:34,629 --> 01:10:36,874
What do you make of this business now?

1150
01:10:36,909 --> 01:10:39,820
I suppose there are people in 
this town who dislike me enough to

1151
01:10:39,820 --> 01:10:41,796
arrange a put-up job of this sort.

1152
01:10:41,796 --> 01:10:43,540
What on earth are you doing?

1153
01:10:43,705 --> 01:10:46,297
I'm gonna phone the police.
- Idiot!

1154
01:10:46,297 --> 01:10:47,140
Give me that!

1155
01:10:47,275 --> 01:10:49,513
If the man's an impostor we'd better have him
him arrested before he escapes, haven't we?

1156
01:10:49,592 --> 01:10:52,180
You keep out of this. And keep
the police out too.

1157
01:10:52,319 --> 01:10:54,897
Anyway, he can't escape without 
coming out here.

1158
01:10:54,898 --> 01:10:56,120
What about the windows?

1159
01:10:56,300 --> 01:11:02,656
Impossible, they're barbed. 
Just a moment.

1160
01:11:02,656 --> 01:11:07,115
I'm sorry Inspector, we shan't keep you
much longer.

1161
01:11:12,614 --> 01:11:14,812
Now we've got him.

1162
01:11:14,847 --> 01:11:18,270
All we have to do is to settle 
quietly amongst ourselves

1163
01:11:18,270 --> 01:11:21,562
what to do, and the best 
way to deal with him.

1164
01:11:21,613 --> 01:11:23,835
We've established he's an impostor.

1165
01:11:23,845 --> 01:11:25,641
It's the same rotten story
whether we told it to a

1166
01:11:25,658 --> 01:11:27,656
police inspector or somebody else, 
what difference does it make?

1167
01:11:27,707 --> 01:11:31,145
It makes all the difference between a 
lot of stuff like this coming out in private, 

1168
01:11:31,195 --> 01:11:33,179
and a downright public scandal!

1169
01:11:33,179 --> 01:11:35,185
Scandal? What does a scandal matter?

1170
01:11:35,260 --> 01:11:37,260
The girl's dead and we all helped 
to kill her, that's what matters.

1171
01:11:37,491 --> 01:11:39,340
But did we? Who says so?

1172
01:11:39,341 --> 01:11:40,950
There's no real evidence that we did.

1173
01:11:41,225 --> 01:11:42,922
Of course there is!
- No, there isn't!

1174
01:11:42,922 --> 01:11:46,343
Just think! A man comes here 
pretending to be a police officer.

1175
01:11:46,344 --> 01:11:47,265
Now what does he do?

1176
01:11:47,635 --> 01:11:50,968
Very artfully, working on bits of information 
he's picked up here and there,

1177
01:11:51,002 --> 01:11:52,805
he bluffs us into confessing 
that we've been

1178
01:11:52,828 --> 01:11:54,652
mixed up in this girl's life 
in one way or another.

1179
01:11:54,769 --> 01:11:56,335
And so we have.

1180
01:11:56,370 --> 01:11:58,185
But how do we know it's the same girl?

1181
01:11:58,465 --> 01:12:00,854
We all admitted it anyway. 
- No we didn't!

1182
01:12:00,961 --> 01:12:02,774
We admitted something to do with a girl,

1183
01:12:02,775 --> 01:12:05,505
but how do we know it's the same girl? 
- By the photograph.

1184
01:12:05,506 --> 01:12:07,320
But how do we know 
it's the same photograph?

1185
01:12:07,321 --> 01:12:08,955
He was very careful that Eric and I

1186
01:12:09,220 --> 01:12:10,534
shouldn't see the one 
he showed to your father.

1187
01:12:10,534 --> 01:12:12,228
Now just think back.

1188
01:12:15,016 --> 01:12:17,848
Did any two of us look at the 
same photograph at once?

1189
01:12:17,849 --> 01:12:19,326
No.

1190
01:12:20,118 --> 01:12:22,998
No. - No. - Precisely.

1191
01:12:23,033 --> 01:12:25,057
There's no proof that it was 
the same photograph

1192
01:12:25,058 --> 01:12:27,261
Therefore, no proof that
 it was the same girl.

1193
01:12:29,617 --> 01:12:31,844
Daisy Renton was really Eva Smith.

1194
01:12:31,879 --> 01:12:34,962
We've only got his word for it and 
he may have been lying all the time.

1195
01:12:34,963 --> 01:12:37,993
Of course! There were probably 4 or 5
different girls.

1196
01:12:37,994 --> 01:12:41,130
That doesn't matter to me.
The one I knew is dead.

1197
01:12:41,131 --> 01:12:44,587
Well, we can soon settle that.
- Oh? How?

1198
01:12:46,397 --> 01:12:48,360
By ringing the infirmary.

1199
01:12:48,395 --> 01:12:52,839
Hello, will you get me the infirmary? 
It's urgent. No, I don't know the number.

1200
01:12:53,570 --> 01:12:55,933
Either there's a dead girl there
or there isn't.

1201
01:12:55,934 --> 01:12:57,994
And if there isn't?

1202
01:12:58,603 --> 01:13:00,953
Hello? Is that the infirmary?

1203
01:13:02,135 --> 01:13:04,909
This is Mister Gerald Croft speaking, 
of Croft's limited.

1204
01:13:04,910 --> 01:13:08,083
We are rather worried 
about one of our employees.

1205
01:13:08,118 --> 01:13:10,635
Have you had a girl brought 
in there this afternoon

1206
01:13:10,685 --> 01:13:12,705
who commited suicide 
by drinking disinfectant?

1207
01:13:12,705 --> 01:13:15,058
or... any suicide?

1208
01:13:15,059 --> 01:13:16,728
Yes, I'll wait.

1209
01:13:28,072 --> 01:13:29,222
Yes?

1210
01:13:30,891 --> 01:13:32,546
You're certain of that?

1211
01:13:33,590 --> 01:13:36,622
I see. Thank you very much. Goodbye.

1212
01:13:38,856 --> 01:13:40,819
No girl has died there today.

1213
01:13:40,820 --> 01:13:42,718
They haven't had a suicide in months.

1214
01:13:42,719 --> 01:13:46,525
What a relief! Gerald my boy, 
pull us out some drinks at once!

1215
01:13:46,945 --> 01:13:52,652
To think that it's all over!
- Is it? - Well isn't it?

1216
01:13:52,687 --> 01:13:55,101
We've just been had, that's all!

1217
01:13:55,504 --> 01:13:57,540
So nothing's really happened?

1218
01:13:57,541 --> 01:14:00,867
Just because it didn't end tragically,
there's nothing to be sorry for?

1219
01:14:00,868 --> 01:14:02,137
Nothing to learn?

1220
01:14:02,172 --> 01:14:06,923
We can all go on behaving just 
as we did! - Well, why shouldn't we?

1221
01:14:06,924 --> 01:14:08,580
You had begun to learn something,

1222
01:14:08,920 --> 01:14:10,920
but now you're ready to 
go on the same old way?

1223
01:14:10,954 --> 01:14:13,147
Oh, and you're not, eh?

1224
01:14:14,346 --> 01:14:15,346
No.

1225
01:14:15,812 --> 01:14:19,412
Because I remember what he said and
how he made me feel.

1226
01:14:19,615 --> 01:14:22,249
It frightens me the way you talk.

1227
01:14:23,471 --> 01:14:25,252
It frightens me, too.

1228
01:14:25,287 --> 01:14:30,445
Just look at them! The famous 
younger generation who know it all!

1229
01:14:30,480 --> 01:14:33,180
They can't even take a joke!

1230
01:14:33,522 --> 01:14:37,895
I tell you, whoever that inspector is, as 
long as I live I shall never forget him.

1231
01:14:37,896 --> 01:14:40,079
I do! I'd forgotten all about him!

1232
01:14:40,114 --> 01:14:44,409
Oh good gracious! Now Arthur, 
what do you think we'd better do?

1233
01:14:44,410 --> 01:14:47,347
We don't want any fuss or scandal. 
- Leave it to me my dear. 

1234
01:14:47,382 --> 01:14:51,170
 We'll just give him a fright and 
send him away with a flea in his ear.

1235
01:14:51,205 --> 01:14:53,416
After all, you know, 
we owe him the right!

1236
01:14:55,969 --> 01:14:57,277
Now look here,

1237
01:14:57,312 --> 01:14:59,692
I want  to have a few 
straight words with you.

1238
01:14:59,880 --> 01:15:04,622
One or two facts have come 
my way, Mister so-called inspector.

1239
01:15:04,657 --> 01:15:07,545
And now it's my turn to 
ask you a few questions,

1240
01:15:07,745 --> 01:15:09,291
and I don't think you're going to like 
- Father

1241
01:15:09,291 --> 01:15:11,013
You're wanted on the telephone.

1242
01:15:11,631 --> 01:15:13,585
Just a minute.

1243
01:15:16,971 --> 01:15:20,764
Mister Birling speaking.
Yes, Fletcher?

1244
01:15:23,490 --> 01:15:24,725
What?

1245
01:15:32,024 --> 01:15:33,679
Here?

1246
01:15:41,140 --> 01:15:42,941
It was the police.

1247
01:15:43,413 --> 01:15:46,878
A girl has just died on 
her way to the infirmary.

1248
01:15:46,913 --> 01:15:49,830
After swallowing some disinfectant.

1249
01:15:50,475 --> 01:15:53,260
The police inspector is on his way here.

1250
01:15:53,762 --> 01:15:56,534
To ask some questions.
