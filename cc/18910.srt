2
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:55,320
Aborting the launch.

3
00:03:58,698 --> 00:04:01,868
Aborting the launch.

4
00:04:01,951 --> 00:04:05,580
There is nothing up there!
Nothing, nothing!

5
00:04:57,090 --> 00:04:59,551
Somebody's coming.

6
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:07,058
Good morning, you fucking Venusians!
You wanna fight me? I'll fight you!

7
00:05:07,433 --> 00:05:09,686
May Day, May day,
Sink the Bismarck!

8
00:05:09,686 --> 00:05:11,729
I'm coming down.

9
00:05:13,606 --> 00:05:16,234
Look out..this looks like a job for superman...

10
00:05:16,234 --> 00:05:22,824
Damn you Mayor Nammack,
get a move on! Move on! Move on you weirdos!

11
00:05:22,824 --> 00:05:25,368
You know I wish you'd douche; sincerely.

12
00:05:26,411 --> 00:05:27,662
Watch your elbow.

13
00:05:27,829 --> 00:05:30,039
Hey mom, could I have a quarter for the movies please?

14
00:05:30,665 --> 00:05:33,877
Damned sun, there is no color in the air.

15
00:05:34,544 --> 00:05:37,380
- What country is this?
- The Bronx.

16
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:41,843
Attention!

17
00:05:52,145 --> 00:05:54,314
Hail Caesar!

18
00:06:01,362 --> 00:06:04,866
Towards the end of the war in Vietnam
an unusually high percentage...

19
00:06:04,908 --> 00:06:09,245
... of american servicemen suddenly manifested symptoms of psychosis.

20
00:06:09,537 --> 00:06:11,873
Most of them were in combat...

21
00:06:11,915 --> 00:06:15,001
... and had no prior history of mental disturbance.

22
00:06:15,835 --> 00:06:17,587
These facts,

23
00:06:17,587 --> 00:06:20,715
plus the epidemic scope of the problem
and the controversial nature of the vietnam war...

24
00:06:20,757 --> 00:06:22,967
...led american authorities to wonder whether many...

25
00:06:22,967 --> 00:06:25,136
... if not most of the men, were faking.

26
00:06:25,929 --> 00:06:28,181
To probe the mystery,

27
00:06:28,223 --> 00:06:30,808
the government established a network of
secret study centres and clinics.

28
00:06:30,934 --> 00:06:35,104
The last of these
No. 18 was highly experimental in nature...

29
00:06:35,146 --> 00:06:39,108
... set up in an old abandoned castle in Pacific NorthWest in United States.

30
00:06:40,318 --> 00:06:42,779
Among these inmates was an astronaut,

31
00:06:42,779 --> 00:06:46,324
who during final countdown
had aborted the mission into outer space.

32
00:06:47,158 --> 00:06:50,161
Robert Browning had the clap,

33
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:54,374
and he caught it from Charlotte
and Emily Bronte.

34
00:06:54,499 --> 00:06:59,212
- Shut your mouth, you crazy bastard!
- You don't want to hear the truth.

35
00:06:59,754 --> 00:07:02,799
- He caught it from both of them...
- Shut up!

36
00:07:04,509 --> 00:07:06,678
Fucking weirdos.

37
00:07:06,970 --> 00:07:10,473
Yellow smartass college pricks...
- that says it.

38
00:07:15,687 --> 00:07:17,480
Who do you think you're kidding, huh?

39
00:07:20,608 --> 00:07:24,237
Well bad news boys.
Tough shit.

40
00:07:27,198 --> 00:07:30,326
Well, guess who's coming to take command next week?

41
00:07:30,577 --> 00:07:32,537
Can you guess boys, huh?

42
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:37,458
A psychiatrist!

43
00:07:38,293 --> 00:07:40,879
The best. The best in uniform!

44
00:07:41,212 --> 00:07:44,757
The greatest fucking psychiatrist since Jung!

45
00:07:46,551 --> 00:07:49,721
Guessing you're good at,
you slimy snakes...

46
00:07:49,971 --> 00:07:51,556
- Bravo.
- Good image.

47
00:07:52,098 --> 00:07:54,642
- Splendid, Groper.
- Just one more thing sir.

48
00:07:54,684 --> 00:07:55,852
What?

49
00:07:55,852 --> 00:07:58,980
Stick a pineapple up your ass
and pretend you're Hawaiian.
-Jesus..

50
00:08:00,857 --> 00:08:02,942
Dammit! Who the hell is coming?

51
00:08:03,193 --> 00:08:07,739
Vincent, vincent...

52
00:08:08,531 --> 00:08:09,699
Vincent!

53
00:08:24,756 --> 00:08:28,551
- Sorry, sir.
- Yes, its alright.

54
00:08:36,226 --> 00:08:41,105
I confess that I love you...

55
00:08:42,565 --> 00:08:46,903
... tell me will you love me too.

56
00:08:48,196 --> 00:08:52,700
I confess that I need you...
Oh yes, I do.

57
00:08:56,412 --> 00:08:58,581
- ... need you every morning.
- Shut up!

58
00:09:00,583 --> 00:09:02,001
What's that in your hand?

59
00:09:02,126 --> 00:09:05,922
A fog horn...chinese junks have
been reported in the area.

60
00:09:05,922 --> 00:09:08,132
Cutshaw, get back in the line.

61
00:09:12,554 --> 00:09:15,098
- Fall in!
- You're supposed to be nice to us, Groper.

62
00:09:15,807 --> 00:09:19,060
Here comes the psychiatrist, Groper..
time to clean up your act!

63
00:09:19,227 --> 00:09:21,521
Yeah, call us pricks now, Groper.
Go ahead.

64
00:09:21,563 --> 00:09:26,109
Hey, lets hear it for the shrink!
Let's have a song "You are my sunshine."

65
00:09:28,987 --> 00:09:34,200
"You are my sunshine, my only sunshine...

66
00:09:34,742 --> 00:09:39,622
... you make me happy,
When skies are grey.

67
00:09:40,123 --> 00:09:45,211
You'll never know, dear,
How much I love you....

68
00:09:46,129 --> 00:09:50,842
Please don't take my sunshine away".

69
00:09:51,259 --> 00:09:55,805
- Boys, would you knock this off.
- Fuck you.

70
00:09:58,266 --> 00:09:59,434
Its very pretty.

71
00:09:59,767 --> 00:10:02,979
Famous lines from famous movies!

72
00:10:03,396 --> 00:10:07,275
"Oh Frankie, your mother forgives me!"

73
00:10:08,568 --> 00:10:10,570
Victor McLaglen in "The Informer"

74
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:15,200
"We don't need no stinking badges"

75
00:10:15,491 --> 00:10:19,037
"The Treasure of Sierra Madre"

76
00:10:21,789 --> 00:10:23,041
Thank you, sargeant.

77
00:10:23,875 --> 00:10:26,544
- Take care.
- Goodbye, sir.

78
00:10:27,003 --> 00:10:27,795
Goodbye.

79
00:10:37,013 --> 00:10:39,682
He's done it again...
My jacket, my shirt and my pants...

80
00:10:41,643 --> 00:10:42,685
Sir.

81
00:10:56,699 --> 00:10:58,910
Boys, come to attention.

82
00:10:59,285 --> 00:11:02,163
You've go to say "Simon says"
then we'll do it...

83
00:11:02,664 --> 00:11:03,831
Play therapy. What a fine thought!

84
00:11:05,458 --> 00:11:06,501
- Poor bastards.
- Simon says fall in!

85
00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:13,216
You're a psychiatrist, aren't you?
Kane...

86
00:11:14,259 --> 00:11:16,344
Yeah, I thought so. I'm Fromme,
I'm a medical officer.

87
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:20,682
Sure as glad you're best.
I can use all the help I can possibly get.

88
00:11:20,974 --> 00:11:22,600
- Cutshaw!
- Fuck you.

89
00:11:23,059 --> 00:11:24,853
Just answer: "Present".

90
00:11:25,061 --> 00:11:27,313
They're really far gone.

91
00:11:28,439 --> 00:11:29,274
Perhaps...

92
00:11:31,359 --> 00:11:32,527
Perhaps?

93
00:11:32,986 --> 00:11:36,406
What do you mean? You're following
some crazy new school of psychiatry?

94
00:11:36,573 --> 00:11:39,117
These guys are nuttier than a wagon-load of pralines.

95
00:11:40,410 --> 00:11:42,287
Fromme, where is Fromme?

96
00:11:44,581 --> 00:11:47,166
- Would you please direct me to my quarters?
- What?

97
00:11:49,085 --> 00:11:52,463
- My quarters, would you please direct me to my quarters?
- Sure; just follow the yellow brick road.

98
00:11:53,339 --> 00:11:56,176
- I beg your pardon?
- I said follow... here they are.

99
00:11:56,467 --> 00:11:58,094
Sargeant Krebs and Christian, Sir.

100
00:11:58,469 --> 00:12:02,098
And bloody damn well about time...
Will you get this man into surgery?

101
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:06,644
Or you are planning to just let him
stand here while you and your buddies play soldier?!

102
00:12:06,728 --> 00:12:09,063
For chrissake, what is this?
A hospital or a nuthouse?

103
00:12:09,564 --> 00:12:12,442
No, no!
Not the stethoscope!

104
00:12:13,818 --> 00:12:15,778
Don't let him wrinkle the pants.

105
00:12:17,739 --> 00:12:19,490
I'm colonel Richard Fell,
I'm the medic.

106
00:12:24,287 --> 00:12:25,038
Really...

107
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:27,665
Boys, aren't you being a little dick silly?

108
00:12:27,957 --> 00:12:29,667
Vincent?

109
00:12:32,045 --> 00:12:33,296
Could I have it again please?

110
00:12:34,422 --> 00:12:36,049
You remind me of Vincent Van Gogh...

111
00:12:36,549 --> 00:12:39,344
Either that.... or a lark in a wheat field.
I'm not sure which.

112
00:12:39,427 --> 00:12:41,971
- Have you been drinking?
- Never in uniform, no.

113
00:12:42,013 --> 00:12:42,597
I see.

114
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:44,933
That's my last pair of pants he's got there, you see.

115
00:12:44,974 --> 00:12:46,809
All the rest of them are at the cleaners.

116
00:12:46,893 --> 00:12:49,062
and Colonel, if you're planning on
my holding this salute much longer,

117
00:12:49,062 --> 00:12:52,815
would you mind calling the Memorial hospital and telling
the donor arm is ready for the transplant?

118
00:12:52,815 --> 00:12:55,652
I expect it to be falling off almost any second now.

119
00:12:56,861 --> 00:12:58,696
Thank you, sir.
You're a prince of the realm, I swear it.

120
00:12:59,405 --> 00:13:00,782
Attention!

121
00:13:01,199 --> 00:13:02,909
Shut your fucking mouths.

122
00:13:05,161 --> 00:13:06,204
Firmes!

123
00:13:06,788 --> 00:13:09,916
Listen, I know my rights.
I want to see my urologist.

124
00:13:18,007 --> 00:13:19,592
Hail Caesar!

125
00:13:22,804 --> 00:13:25,139
Sir, I present the group.

126
00:13:29,811 --> 00:13:31,938
Jesus Christ...

127
00:13:51,165 --> 00:13:52,292
Dismissed.

128
00:15:28,596 --> 00:15:29,764
Ok, set the cards.

129
00:15:30,139 --> 00:15:31,349
Anything wild?

130
00:15:31,891 --> 00:15:34,644
Douches, 3s, 5s, 7s, 9s and Jack.

131
00:15:35,186 --> 00:15:37,522
You are a very sick man.

132
00:15:42,151 --> 00:15:43,278
Are you finished?

133
00:15:45,697 --> 00:15:50,034
- Most people cut them only once.
- 13 is my lucky number.

134
00:16:13,683 --> 00:16:15,143
Yup, I know what you mean.

135
00:16:15,643 --> 00:16:17,520
It was Amy Biltmore's place.

136
00:16:17,770 --> 00:16:21,858
She had it brought over here from Germany
in 1900, stone by stone...

137
00:16:22,442 --> 00:16:25,403
It belonged to her husband, Count of Eltz.
What's the matter? You don't like it?

138
00:16:26,487 --> 00:16:27,864
Its hardly therapuetic.

139
00:16:28,865 --> 00:16:30,450
Yeah, Exactly what Dracula said about it.

140
00:16:31,034 --> 00:16:34,537
But its hidden away in the spring, the Biltmores not brought him for nothing.

141
00:16:36,998 --> 00:16:38,082
Wish I hadn't said that...

142
00:16:42,962 --> 00:16:45,048
- You remind me of someone.
- Who?

143
00:16:46,257 --> 00:16:47,717
I don't know.

144
00:16:49,010 --> 00:16:50,803
But you seem so familiar to me.

145
00:16:50,845 --> 00:16:54,307
Dracula said that too. You see,
when he sees a neck, he'll say anything.

146
00:16:54,516 --> 00:16:56,518
- I guess it will come to me.
- What?

147
00:16:56,768 --> 00:16:58,728
Who you remind me of...

148
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:00,772
Oh, didn't you say -

149
00:17:10,323 --> 00:17:12,909
- I hid it goddammit, I hid it.
  Where did you find -
- Groper.

150
00:17:13,785 --> 00:17:15,203
But sir, he's been pounding that...

151
00:17:15,245 --> 00:17:17,330
I don't care what he's being doing,

152
00:17:17,330 --> 00:17:19,499
You're not to put your hands on him.

153
00:17:19,499 --> 00:17:21,709
But colonel, he can't...!

154
00:17:25,588 --> 00:17:26,506
Yes sir.

155
00:17:27,882 --> 00:17:29,133
Right, sir.

156
00:17:32,178 --> 00:17:34,180
Whatever you say, sir.

157
00:17:34,514 --> 00:17:37,308
- You're Capitán Fairbanks?
- Not today.

158
00:17:37,350 --> 00:17:39,310
I'm sorry?
I'm sure you were...

159
00:17:39,519 --> 00:17:42,605
Not today, do you understand me?

160
00:17:44,524 --> 00:17:46,609
Multiple personality.

161
00:17:46,985 --> 00:17:49,779
- My house has many mansions.
- Yes.

162
00:17:50,446 --> 00:17:53,783
I am Dr. Franz VonPaulie.

163
00:17:54,492 --> 00:17:55,910
Why did you do that to the wall?

164
00:17:56,703 --> 00:18:00,248
Because I am convinced that
we can walk through walls.

165
00:18:00,790 --> 00:18:03,042
Not only me...

166
00:18:04,002 --> 00:18:04,961
Anyone.

167
00:18:05,837 --> 00:18:08,506
Cops, people.

168
00:18:09,465 --> 00:18:11,217
People in Nashville.

169
00:18:12,594 --> 00:18:17,724
I tried to exert the full force of my mind
on all the atoms of my body,

170
00:18:18,057 --> 00:18:25,815
So that they will mix, rearrange and
fit exactly all the holes in that wall.

171
00:18:27,650 --> 00:18:30,278
Then I tried the laboratory method...

172
00:18:30,945 --> 00:18:33,448
I tried to walk through it...

173
00:18:34,991 --> 00:18:36,659
through the wall...

174
00:18:37,911 --> 00:18:42,081
Just like a few minutes ago
when I took a running bash,

175
00:18:42,582 --> 00:18:46,753
and I failed horribly.

176
00:18:54,010 --> 00:18:56,304
I am punishing the atoms.

177
00:18:56,638 --> 00:18:59,224
I am making an example of them...

178
00:19:00,266 --> 00:19:03,436
An object lesson, a thing...

179
00:19:05,021 --> 00:19:07,607
... so when the other atoms see what's coming,

180
00:19:08,399 --> 00:19:10,235
they'll let me pass through.

181
00:19:10,735 --> 00:19:14,781
Independent snots!
Shape up of ship out!

182
00:19:16,491 --> 00:19:18,034
- May I?
- No.

183
00:19:25,792 --> 00:19:30,922
Your grip is very very strong.

184
00:19:31,047 --> 00:19:36,261
I think, that your problem lies
in the properties of the hammer.

185
00:19:36,302 --> 00:19:37,720
Interesting theory...

186
00:19:38,388 --> 00:19:40,473
May I keep it for study?

187
00:19:40,473 --> 00:19:43,059
You're not gonna play with it or anything?

188
00:19:43,309 --> 00:19:44,352
No I won't.

189
00:19:45,854 --> 00:19:48,773
Ok, good night.

190
00:19:50,233 --> 00:19:52,068
Good night, Captain Fairbanks.

191
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:15,550
Yeah I know,

192
00:20:15,550 --> 00:20:18,761
I had to kill a fifth of scotch
just to get to sleep.

193
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:23,224
No..no I don't believe in pills.
Sleeping pills keep you awake anyway.

194
00:20:24,517 --> 00:20:27,187
Why should I have to explain that?
Its self-explanatory.

195
00:20:28,146 --> 00:20:29,939
You want me to explain it? Alright...

196
00:20:30,231 --> 00:20:32,942
In a very short time,
you build up tolerance, right?

197
00:20:35,695 --> 00:20:37,155
That's right? You got it.

198
00:20:38,281 --> 00:20:40,241
Anyway..he's here.

199
00:20:41,784 --> 00:20:43,411
Yeah, yesterday.

200
00:20:45,455 --> 00:20:49,000
No, I don't know.
Its too soon to tell.

201
00:20:52,504 --> 00:20:53,713
Yes, I will.

202
00:20:54,214 --> 00:20:55,256
Yes, I will.

203
00:20:56,257 --> 00:20:58,259
Thank you, sir. Goodbye.

204
00:21:10,146 --> 00:21:11,272
Jesus.

205
00:21:16,486 --> 00:21:19,197
Don't blame me,
I told them not to operate.

206
00:21:23,159 --> 00:21:25,453
Welcome to Transylvania.

207
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:29,165
Do you plan to get dressed?

208
00:21:29,165 --> 00:21:32,168
How the hell can I get dressed when
Lieutinant Fromme won't surrender my pants?

209
00:21:32,168 --> 00:21:34,254
- You don't want me to rip them off!
- No.

210
00:21:34,254 --> 00:21:36,464
You bet your ass it will wrinkle your pants.

211
00:21:36,673 --> 00:21:37,590
Here you go.

212
00:21:37,841 --> 00:21:39,926
Case histories on the men.

213
00:21:39,926 --> 00:21:42,554
I've been through them all,
and have learnt nothing.

214
00:21:43,638 --> 00:21:46,099
I think this boar was a diabetic.

215
00:21:47,934 --> 00:21:49,143
May I come in?

216
00:21:49,227 --> 00:21:51,145
- Oh, heck.
- Thats yours.

217
00:21:51,229 --> 00:21:52,564
So thats your couch...

218
00:21:52,605 --> 00:21:55,191
Why don't you make it better nailed..

219
00:21:55,191 --> 00:21:58,027
so that we can all see the blood pouring out?

220
00:21:58,194 --> 00:22:00,822
- Cutshaw, the astronaut.
- I would say yes.

221
00:22:00,947 --> 00:22:01,990
God of mine...

222
00:22:02,448 --> 00:22:03,992
You are the new boy, huh?

223
00:22:04,075 --> 00:22:05,660
I'm Colonel Hudson Kane.

224
00:22:06,119 --> 00:22:08,496
- Do I call you Hud?
- Try calling him Colonel.

225
00:22:08,788 --> 00:22:10,498
Are you the one that makes the chicken?

226
00:22:10,874 --> 00:22:12,083
Coronel Kane's a psychiatrist.

227
00:22:12,417 --> 00:22:14,752
Sure...
And they told me you were a doctor.

228
00:22:15,295 --> 00:22:18,423
This man treats crocodiles for acne!

229
00:22:18,548 --> 00:22:19,883
Why make my point?

230
00:22:20,633 --> 00:22:24,137
Pack up and leave, Hud.
You're on the way out.

231
00:22:24,179 --> 00:22:26,347
I'm acting on orders, so to inform.

232
00:22:26,347 --> 00:22:28,391
Who ordered you, Cutshaw?

233
00:22:28,433 --> 00:22:31,978
Unseen forces far too numerous to enumerate.

234
00:22:32,187 --> 00:22:34,397
Check the file;
Its all in the file...

235
00:22:44,657 --> 00:22:45,533
Here it is.

236
00:22:47,327 --> 00:22:48,661
Now read it, Hud.

237
00:22:48,745 --> 00:22:51,039
Read it out loud.Its my therapy

238
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:52,248
Why don't we-

239
00:22:52,290 --> 00:22:55,376
Read it! Or I will go crazy, dammit!
I swear it!

240
00:22:55,418 --> 00:22:57,003
And you will be responsible.

241
00:22:58,671 --> 00:23:00,548
Alright, Cutshaw.
Please sit down.

242
00:23:04,511 --> 00:23:06,804
I think the end of the world just came...

243
00:23:06,846 --> 00:23:09,766
... for the bag of Fritos in my pocket.

244
00:23:09,849 --> 00:23:12,602
Would you please tell Fromme I'd like my pants?

245
00:23:12,644 --> 00:23:14,103
Consider the lilies of the field.

246
00:23:21,152 --> 00:23:22,612
I'm waiting...

247
00:23:31,871 --> 00:23:35,250
Two days prior to a scheduled space shot,

248
00:23:35,834 --> 00:23:38,670
subject officer, while dining on the base,

249
00:23:39,170 --> 00:23:42,924
was observed to pick up a plastic ketchup bottle...

250
00:23:43,633 --> 00:23:47,345
squeeze a thin red line across his throat,

251
00:23:48,638 --> 00:23:52,684
and then to stagger and fall
very heavily across the table...

252
00:23:53,476 --> 00:23:58,398
...then being occupied by the director
of the National Space Administration,

253
00:23:59,065 --> 00:24:00,275
gurgling...

254
00:24:02,068 --> 00:24:05,572
"Don't-order-the-swordfish"

255
00:24:09,492 --> 00:24:12,328
You're looking at my medal, Hud.
Stop looking at my medal.

256
00:24:12,328 --> 00:24:14,122
- No, I'm not...
- Yes, you were.

257
00:24:14,289 --> 00:24:15,582
You covet it!

258
00:24:15,874 --> 00:24:16,916
On the following morning...

259
00:24:16,916 --> 00:24:19,502
- Isn't it beautiful?
- Yes, it's...

260
00:24:19,669 --> 00:24:22,714
Son of a bitch! I knew it.

261
00:24:23,214 --> 00:24:24,465
You were looking at it.

262
00:24:24,465 --> 00:24:27,844
- Sorry.
- Sorry? What good is 'sorry'?

263
00:24:28,094 --> 00:24:29,929
I'm a nervous wreck.

264
00:24:30,054 --> 00:24:32,223
Christ, how can I sleep now?

265
00:24:32,265 --> 00:24:34,559
waiting for a covetous kleptomaniacal
colonel...

266
00:24:34,601 --> 00:24:37,395
.. to come creeping around to my bedside...

267
00:24:37,478 --> 00:24:39,147
... to rip away my medal!

268
00:24:39,230 --> 00:24:40,773
If I were to do that, you might awaken.

269
00:24:41,274 --> 00:24:43,067
Like hell I'll awake.

270
00:24:43,401 --> 00:24:47,030
Powerful drugs could be
insinuated into my soup.

271
00:24:51,117 --> 00:24:52,577
The following morning...

272
00:24:52,785 --> 00:24:55,788
Covety is a sin.

273
00:24:59,584 --> 00:25:01,794
The following morning at 0500...

274
00:25:02,462 --> 00:25:05,507
Subject officer entered the space craft,

275
00:25:10,803 --> 00:25:15,350
and upon recieving instruction from
Control to begin his countdown...

276
00:25:15,934 --> 00:25:20,897
... he was heard instead to say:
"I am frankly sick of being used"

277
00:25:21,773 --> 00:25:23,107
Sometime later,

278
00:25:23,775 --> 00:25:28,363
subject officer plainly stated that:
"Going the moon was naughty, impolite...

279
00:25:28,446 --> 00:25:31,866
... uncouth, and in any case...

280
00:25:31,908 --> 00:25:33,660
... bad for his skin"

281
00:25:35,954 --> 00:25:39,290
- What's the matter? You think that's funny?
- No no, no I don't.

282
00:25:40,333 --> 00:25:41,793
Pack up and leave, Hud.

283
00:25:42,544 --> 00:25:43,670
I've had it!

284
00:25:44,629 --> 00:25:46,714
Cutshaw,
why won't you go to the moon?

285
00:25:46,756 --> 00:25:50,635
Why do camels have humps... and cobras, none?

286
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:51,886
Why won't you go?

287
00:25:51,886 --> 00:25:54,764
The man in the moon tried to fuck my sister.

288
00:25:54,806 --> 00:25:57,934
- Cutshaw...
- The truth of the matter, is that Custer...

289
00:25:57,976 --> 00:26:00,645
... called Sitting Bull a spic.

290
00:26:02,939 --> 00:26:04,107
Reasons are dangerous.

291
00:26:04,482 --> 00:26:05,900
What the hell is this?

292
00:26:06,317 --> 00:26:08,278
"How I believe" by Teilhard?

293
00:26:13,491 --> 00:26:15,368
Show me a catholic,

294
00:26:15,451 --> 00:26:17,412
and I'll show you a junkie.

295
00:26:21,583 --> 00:26:22,792
Dr. Fell.

296
00:26:25,003 --> 00:26:29,299
Once again that fiendish man has
given me that horrible Mark of Fairbanks.

297
00:26:29,549 --> 00:26:31,134
Look, I am Bleeding.

298
00:26:31,426 --> 00:26:33,928
This wound's not self-inflicted?

299
00:26:35,346 --> 00:26:37,307
Mi coronelito...

300
00:26:37,724 --> 00:26:39,017
You are not well.

301
00:26:39,350 --> 00:26:41,352
- No, I'm fine.Thank you.
- Your coloring...

302
00:26:41,769 --> 00:26:44,522
... is absolutely bilious.

303
00:26:45,481 --> 00:26:46,900
Kane, look out!

304
00:26:50,737 --> 00:26:56,826
I want your name, batch number and
name of every other boar in your group.

305
00:26:57,285 --> 00:26:59,871
You have the right to remain silent.

306
00:27:01,164 --> 00:27:02,916
No a Portrait of Jenny, perhaps..

307
00:27:04,250 --> 00:27:11,090
but atleast, no more Dorian Gray!
Ciao!

308
00:27:15,512 --> 00:27:17,430
I know you want to be an artist.

309
00:27:22,268 --> 00:27:25,813
Okay, I'm absolutely ready for my
ink-blot test now. I absolutely flips me!

310
00:27:26,147 --> 00:27:29,234
Now, while you're fresh with
all those roses in your cheeks...

311
00:27:29,275 --> 00:27:31,611
- Cutshaw...
- He's a psychiatrist!

312
00:27:32,195 --> 00:27:34,447
"My god Rick, help me!"

313
00:27:34,614 --> 00:27:36,324
Casablanca.

314
00:27:38,952 --> 00:27:40,828
Alright Cutshaw, please sit down.

315
00:27:59,013 --> 00:28:00,056
What do you see?

316
00:28:00,098 --> 00:28:03,434
An old woman in funny clothes blowing
poisoned darts at a buffalo.

317
00:28:03,476 --> 00:28:04,769
Bison.

318
00:28:10,108 --> 00:28:11,317
I'm waiting.

319
00:28:14,737 --> 00:28:17,282
My whole life rushing past me in an instant.

320
00:28:18,032 --> 00:28:21,160
- This one?
- Kafka talking to a bedbug.

321
00:28:21,536 --> 00:28:22,579
Correct.

322
00:28:22,704 --> 00:28:25,748
- You're full of shit. You know that?
- I thought it was Kafka.

323
00:28:25,623 --> 00:28:27,959
You wouldn't know Kafka
from Betty Davis.

324
00:28:28,084 --> 00:28:30,211
And you, you're a mental case.

325
00:28:30,336 --> 00:28:34,048
- Yes, maybe I am.
- Ingratiating bastard.

326
00:28:34,632 --> 00:28:37,218
Do you always play kiss-ass
with the loonies?

327
00:28:37,552 --> 00:28:39,846
- No.
- I like you Kane, You're regular.

328
00:28:43,183 --> 00:28:46,060
Take the medal,
I'll take this book.

329
00:28:46,186 --> 00:28:47,520
What book?

330
00:28:49,272 --> 00:28:52,400
"I Remember Mamma"
by Oedipus Rex.

331
00:29:02,452 --> 00:29:05,914
- May I go?
- You're gone, you're gone...

332
00:29:29,562 --> 00:29:31,606
- Saint Christopher.
- Protect us.

333
00:29:37,195 --> 00:29:39,948
- There's something engraved on the back of it.
- Ora pro nobis?

334
00:29:42,033 --> 00:29:43,952
"I'm a buddhist...

335
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:47,747
... In case of an accident, call a lama"

336
00:29:53,503 --> 00:29:55,213
What's Cutshaw's religion?

337
00:29:55,380 --> 00:29:57,674
I don't know.
Read the file; it's all in the file.

338
00:30:01,469 --> 00:30:03,221
Elementary psychology.

339
00:30:05,056 --> 00:30:06,432
Well, here are my pants.

340
00:30:09,936 --> 00:30:10,979
What's this?

341
00:30:11,062 --> 00:30:12,438
I think it's a dog.

342
00:30:13,147 --> 00:30:14,607
Goddammit, not the pants!

343
00:30:17,652 --> 00:30:21,072
Ah, there you are!
Why do I have to put up with your
temperament this early in the morning?

344
00:30:22,323 --> 00:30:24,701
Sorry Colonel. It's hard to keep track of -

345
00:30:24,742 --> 00:30:27,495
- Major Groper, let it be.
- But Colonel!

346
00:30:27,662 --> 00:30:30,748
Alright. The men may see me whenever they need to.

347
00:30:30,832 --> 00:30:32,792
You heard?

348
00:30:33,001 --> 00:30:34,669
Whatever you say, sir.

349
00:30:37,297 --> 00:30:40,633
Quit drinking buttermilk Daiquiris
in the closet, Groper.

350
00:30:43,011 --> 00:30:45,930
That man is a lunatic and dangerous.

351
00:30:46,264 --> 00:30:48,933
Once when I was walking the grounds,

352
00:30:49,017 --> 00:30:51,186
I hear his whispering and I look...

353
00:30:51,728 --> 00:30:57,358
And up in the branches of a cypress tree
there's Groper the crazy bastard
talking in whispers with an owl.

354
00:30:57,525 --> 00:31:01,487
- What?
- A big black and white owl. They're common.

355
00:31:02,155 --> 00:31:04,115
I could'nt testify what they were saying.

356
00:31:04,365 --> 00:31:06,534
They were whispering... you understand me?

357
00:31:06,826 --> 00:31:10,163
I couldn't hear them clearly.
And what I don't know for a fact, I don't say.

358
00:31:10,246 --> 00:31:12,290
That's the kind of hairpin I am.

359
00:31:12,874 --> 00:31:16,252
Reno...

360
00:31:12,874 --> 00:31:16,252
No, Sir, the words weren't clear.
Really sir, believe me.

361
00:31:16,419 --> 00:31:18,421
But there is no cypress tree on the ground.

362
00:31:18,505 --> 00:31:21,883
Doctor, its easy to dig up a tree...

363
00:31:22,342 --> 00:31:25,887
...and then anyone with money
can fill in the hole.

364
00:31:26,304 --> 00:31:27,514
I didn't think of that.

365
00:31:27,889 --> 00:31:30,141
No, you didn't.

366
00:31:30,350 --> 00:31:31,601
Is this your dog?

367
00:31:31,684 --> 00:31:33,436
What does it look like? My zebra?

368
00:31:34,187 --> 00:31:36,022
- What do you call him?
- Irresponsible...

369
00:31:36,022 --> 00:31:38,399
... he's ten minutes late for rehearsal.

370
00:31:38,441 --> 00:31:40,610
Out, Sir Lawrence.

371
00:31:42,862 --> 00:31:46,533
Lieutenant Reno is adapting
Shakespeare's plays for dogs.

372
00:31:46,574 --> 00:31:49,827
A labor of love! A fucking headache!
But goddammit, somebody's got to do it!

373
00:31:50,203 --> 00:31:53,373
We are just getting into Julius Ceasar.
Want to come to rehearsal?

374
00:31:53,831 --> 00:31:58,169
We're doing that terribly gripping scene
where this very noble-looking dalmatian...

375
00:31:58,378 --> 00:32:02,590
... whips his toga around himself - thusly...

376
00:32:03,758 --> 00:32:06,803
and snarls "Et tu, White Fang?"

377
00:32:06,886 --> 00:32:09,889
I'd like to ask your opinion
about a problem in Hamlet.

378
00:32:10,181 --> 00:32:14,269
You see, if i cast a Great Dane in the role,
they're gonna accuse me of -

379
00:32:10,181 --> 00:32:14,269
Frankie, look...

380
00:32:16,688 --> 00:32:19,315
Lieutenant Spinell,
my casting director.

381
00:32:19,899 --> 00:32:21,901
- Hi fellas.
- We're looking for talent.

382
00:32:22,110 --> 00:32:24,320
So far this production is a one-dog-show.

383
00:32:25,822 --> 00:32:26,990
Who's that?

384
00:32:27,615 --> 00:32:30,285
That dog may be Rosencrantz
or Guildenstern.

385
00:32:30,869 --> 00:32:34,706
Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are males,
this dog is a female.

386
00:32:35,456 --> 00:32:36,666
So we take a license.

387
00:32:37,333 --> 00:32:40,336
Get the fuck out of here.

388
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:42,589
Ok, I was only suggesting.

389
00:32:45,675 --> 00:32:46,718
Sorry.

390
00:32:47,719 --> 00:32:48,803
Quiet, Sir Lawrence!

391
00:32:48,845 --> 00:32:52,098
Jesus, why do I live like this!
One moment and he thinks
 he's Barbara Streisand.

392
00:32:55,018 --> 00:32:58,646
Read the classics. It improves
the whole respiratory system.

393
00:33:03,902 --> 00:33:05,028
Adiós.

394
00:33:10,450 --> 00:33:13,077
Quiet! I asked for Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.
And what did you bring me?

395
00:33:13,119 --> 00:33:16,998
Tiny Alice!
I want dobermans, I want even a collie...

396
00:33:17,081 --> 00:33:18,791
Stop breaking my balls!

397
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:21,252
Fairbanks...

398
00:33:23,087 --> 00:33:25,673
It is one of my multiple personalities...

399
00:33:26,216 --> 00:33:28,468
I am sister Eve Black.

400
00:33:29,344 --> 00:33:30,762
I understand...

401
00:33:31,095 --> 00:33:35,016
"The little Sisters of the poor"
is a recognised charity, Krebs.

402
00:33:35,225 --> 00:33:36,643
Fuck off.

403
00:33:39,312 --> 00:33:40,855
They're all that bad?

404
00:33:41,356 --> 00:33:43,733
He was flying those planes we got
from the Germans, you know..

405
00:33:43,733 --> 00:33:46,319
...the ones that take off from the
vertical and then fly straight?

406
00:33:46,694 --> 00:33:49,239
24 of the damned things crashed
for no reason at all...

407
00:33:49,531 --> 00:33:52,408
And right after number 24, Fairbanks found
out that he could talk to trees.

408
00:33:53,117 --> 00:33:54,619
You think they're faking it, then?

409
00:33:54,744 --> 00:33:56,871
I don't know..I just got back myself a week ago.

410
00:33:59,832 --> 00:34:01,376
Biggest mystery is Cutshaw, I guess.

411
00:34:01,543 --> 00:34:02,877
Why him?

412
00:34:02,919 --> 00:34:05,630
Well, he wasn't in combat...
So why should he fake it?

413
00:34:05,672 --> 00:34:08,800
And what about Reno? That man owns a
Congressional medal of honor.

414
00:34:08,842 --> 00:34:11,010
He's pretending insanity to get out of combat?

415
00:34:12,345 --> 00:34:14,848
Well, I'll tell you one thing.
They all have high IQs.

416
00:34:14,973 --> 00:34:17,225
Some of them genius, matter-of-fact.

417
00:34:17,684 --> 00:34:19,811
And most other fakery I've heard about from the corps...

418
00:34:19,811 --> 00:34:23,940
... comes under the category of falling
out of parade in front of a reviewing stand
and then urinating,

419
00:34:23,982 --> 00:34:26,901
...preferably on some field-grade officer's leg.

420
00:34:29,070 --> 00:34:30,113
I don't know.

421
00:34:31,155 --> 00:34:33,491
Maybe we are just fish out of the water.

422
00:34:33,533 --> 00:34:34,784
What was that?

423
00:34:36,744 --> 00:34:38,496
I just think about...

424
00:34:38,872 --> 00:34:41,207
sickness...

425
00:34:41,749 --> 00:34:43,710
cancer in children...

426
00:34:44,419 --> 00:34:46,504
earthquakes, war...

427
00:34:47,964 --> 00:34:49,841
...painful death.

428
00:34:51,593 --> 00:34:53,344
Death.

429
00:34:55,763 --> 00:34:57,348
Just death.

430
00:34:58,975 --> 00:35:02,145
If these things are just part of our natural environment...

431
00:35:02,187 --> 00:35:04,898
Why do we think of them as evil?

432
00:35:05,190 --> 00:35:07,358
Why do they horrify us so?

433
00:35:07,775 --> 00:35:10,695
...unless we were meant for someplace else.

434
00:35:11,905 --> 00:35:15,241
I don't think evil grows out of madness.

435
00:35:16,534 --> 00:35:19,621
I think madness grows out of evil.

436
00:35:20,622 --> 00:35:21,956
Hell, I don't know.

437
00:35:23,458 --> 00:35:26,419
Maybe I'll give them all shock treatment, you know.

438
00:35:28,379 --> 00:35:30,048
Might shake out the phonies, what do you think?

439
00:35:32,675 --> 00:35:33,426
You hate it.

440
00:35:37,889 --> 00:35:39,182
Well I'll see you later.

441
00:37:39,177 --> 00:37:41,721
SHOCK TREATMENT - CURATIVE

442
00:37:51,105 --> 00:37:55,527
What're you holding... ?

443
00:38:04,118 --> 00:38:05,119
All secure, sir.

444
00:38:06,579 --> 00:38:07,914
Sargeant Krebs.

445
00:38:09,082 --> 00:38:11,918
Please tell  Colonel Fell
I want to see him.

446
00:38:12,794 --> 00:38:15,171
Colonel Fell has signed out for the day, sir.

447
00:38:15,839 --> 00:38:18,508
Capitain Bennish may need a thorazine injection.

448
00:38:19,008 --> 00:38:21,052
Who has a key to the drug locker?

449
00:38:22,136 --> 00:38:23,263
Only Colonel Fell, sir.

450
00:38:24,097 --> 00:38:25,306
Sargeant Krebs.

451
00:38:26,349 --> 00:38:30,186
Please tell Colonel Fell I need to see
him as soon as he gets back.

452
00:38:30,687 --> 00:38:32,397
Yes, sir. I will.

453
00:38:33,439 --> 00:38:35,525
- Good night, Sargeant.
- Good night, Sir.

454
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:41,197
Close the door please, Krebs.

455
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:28,453
Colonel, what are you holding...?

456
00:39:28,620 --> 00:39:32,207
You cut off his head with a wire
and he kept on talking...

457
00:39:32,498 --> 00:39:35,084
...Colonel, he was just a boy.

458
00:39:39,923 --> 00:39:41,591
Let's go to the beach.

459
00:39:41,966 --> 00:39:43,968
It's night, and it's raining.

460
00:39:48,515 --> 00:39:51,059
I see you're determined to start an argument.

461
00:39:51,309 --> 00:39:52,644
Go to bed, please.

462
00:39:53,770 --> 00:39:57,857
Hud, there is nothing less attractive
than a psychiatrist who pouts.

463
00:39:58,274 --> 00:40:00,902
What do I have to do to just get in a word with you?

464
00:40:01,569 --> 00:40:03,071
Offer sacrifice?

465
00:40:06,658 --> 00:40:07,825
Then, here!

466
00:40:11,871 --> 00:40:13,331
I brought you a mud-pie.

467
00:40:13,748 --> 00:40:15,250
Now, can I talk to you?

468
00:40:16,417 --> 00:40:17,836
Will you talk about the moon?

469
00:40:18,628 --> 00:40:21,339
Listen, everyone knows that
the moon is Roquefort.

470
00:40:22,215 --> 00:40:24,467
I've come here to talk about Colonel Fell.

471
00:40:25,134 --> 00:40:27,846
- What about him?
- Major Nammack approached him this morning,

472
00:40:28,388 --> 00:40:30,890
complaining of a strange and wondrous illness.

473
00:40:31,599 --> 00:40:34,227
And do you know what that
heartless butcher prescribed?

474
00:40:35,144 --> 00:40:37,021
He said "Here, take this...

475
00:40:36,938 --> 00:40:40,441
... It's a suicide pill with a
mild laxative side-effect"

476
00:40:41,192 --> 00:40:43,194
What kind of bedside manner is that?

477
00:40:43,903 --> 00:40:45,864
I break the arrow of peace.

478
00:40:47,031 --> 00:40:48,324
Why did you buy that arm-band?

479
00:40:48,992 --> 00:40:50,827
- Because I am in mourning.
- For whom?

480
00:40:50,827 --> 00:40:54,163
For God. If God exists, then he's a fink.
Or more likely a Foot:

481
00:40:54,205 --> 00:40:57,500
A giant all-knowing all-powerful Foot.

482
00:40:57,792 --> 00:40:59,919
I don't belong to God...

483
00:40:59,961 --> 00:41:02,213
... so I don't have to hide
in an Argentina Club.

484
00:41:02,463 --> 00:41:04,424
But I believe in the Devil alright.

485
00:41:04,632 --> 00:41:06,134
You know why?

486
00:41:06,259 --> 00:41:08,428
Because the prick keeps doing commercials.

487
00:41:08,428 --> 00:41:10,638
The Original sin might be real.

488
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:12,056
Hello, operator?

489
00:41:12,307 --> 00:41:14,058
Maybe it is something genetic.

490
00:41:14,392 --> 00:41:16,060
Can you prove there is a Foot?

491
00:41:16,436 --> 00:41:18,730
There are some arguments for reason.

492
00:41:19,022 --> 00:41:23,735
Are those the things that we used to
justify dropping atomic bombs on Japan?

493
00:41:25,236 --> 00:41:27,572
I am sorry we have to rush the job like this, Fell.

494
00:41:28,031 --> 00:41:31,576
When I got into what we were trying, we hit the
ceiling. We needed all the help we could get.

495
00:41:31,576 --> 00:41:32,827
And in a hell of a hurry.

496
00:41:34,370 --> 00:41:37,332
- Think we convinced him?
- Oh yeah, he bought it.

497
00:41:37,832 --> 00:41:40,001
- God, I hope so.
- I know how you feel.

498
00:41:40,668 --> 00:41:42,337
You do?

499
00:41:42,837 --> 00:41:44,547
No, I guess I don't.

500
00:41:45,882 --> 00:41:47,425
Well that's life, huh?

501
00:41:48,259 --> 00:41:50,428
Take it easy, now.

502
00:41:50,512 --> 00:41:52,931
- I sure hope it all works out for you.
- Yeah.

503
00:41:54,307 --> 00:41:56,768
Every kind thought thought
is the hope of the world, right?

504
00:41:57,435 --> 00:41:58,520
See you later.

505
00:42:07,362 --> 00:42:08,363
Good luck.

506
00:42:15,537 --> 00:42:18,623
- Horacio...
- Get me a grey hound.

507
00:42:28,591 --> 00:42:31,302
I said get me a grey hound.

508
00:42:32,053 --> 00:42:35,723
- Grey hound.
- That's right...

509
00:42:36,683 --> 00:42:38,268
Pekingese.

510
00:42:38,476 --> 00:42:40,395
And you'll play three feet off the ground?

511
00:42:41,604 --> 00:42:43,982
I want people to wonder about him.

512
00:42:43,982 --> 00:42:45,650
I don't know.

513
00:42:46,025 --> 00:42:49,779
- Why the fuck are you bothering me?
- Polonius...

514
00:42:49,863 --> 00:42:52,407
My Laertes is supposed to be a foil to Hamlet.

515
00:42:52,407 --> 00:42:53,575
Polonius...

516
00:42:53,616 --> 00:42:56,160
- I swear I'm going to hit you in the mouth.
- Polonius...

517
00:42:56,369 --> 00:42:59,122
- Un Chow.
- Labrador...

518
00:43:03,751 --> 00:43:05,545
What the fuck are you doing?

519
00:43:05,587 --> 00:43:07,714
I think he's suffocating.

520
00:43:07,881 --> 00:43:09,674
Good night, sweetheart.

521
00:43:41,039 --> 00:43:42,665
Colonel?

522
00:43:44,751 --> 00:43:47,754
I am telling you Kane is the one who's crazy.

523
00:43:48,046 --> 00:43:52,258
He just sat there doing this. All the time - doing this!

524
00:43:52,967 --> 00:43:54,594
Hell he never even saw me!

525
00:43:55,261 --> 00:43:59,432
I want you to drop like an overripe mango.

526
00:44:00,058 --> 00:44:03,978
A lot of psychiatrists are deeply disturbed.

527
00:44:05,688 --> 00:44:08,483
They've got the highest suicide
rate of any profession in the world..

528
00:44:08,525 --> 00:44:10,610
Now that's a fact, you can check it Captain Billy.

529
00:44:12,862 --> 00:44:14,906
What the hell were you doing at the clinic?

530
00:44:15,156 --> 00:44:17,242
I had cookies in my teeth...

531
00:44:17,367 --> 00:44:19,911
... raisins and crap like that, you know.

532
00:44:19,994 --> 00:44:21,955
I needed some dental floss.

533
00:44:24,332 --> 00:44:25,500
I'm telling you...

534
00:44:25,500 --> 00:44:28,169
He is Gregory Peck
in Spellbound.

535
00:44:28,837 --> 00:44:32,423
He comes to take over the mental asylum,
and he's nuts himself.

536
00:44:32,507 --> 00:44:34,676
I swear it, it's just like that picture.

537
00:44:36,845 --> 00:44:39,347
I took a fork and a tablecloth in front of him...

538
00:44:39,389 --> 00:44:42,100
... I made ski tracks and he fainted.

539
00:44:43,601 --> 00:44:46,980
Would you kindly have the goodness to admit
that you are able read my thoughts?

540
00:44:47,105 --> 00:44:49,691
...that my space-ship crashed on the planet Venus...

541
00:44:49,732 --> 00:44:52,277
...that this is Venus
and you are a Venusian!

542
00:44:52,402 --> 00:44:55,238
That you have ILLEGALLY invaded my mind,

543
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:56,865
making me believe that I am still on earth,

544
00:44:56,906 --> 00:44:59,242
with some demonic hypnotic illusion!

545
00:44:59,284 --> 00:45:01,369
This is NOT earth!
You're NOT an earthman!

546
00:45:01,411 --> 00:45:04,622
I'm standing here with fungus upto my ass,
you bastard.

547
00:45:04,706 --> 00:45:06,374
And you're a giant brain!

548
00:45:06,374 --> 00:45:09,169
Please give me back my flying-belt.
I won't use it to escape..

549
00:45:09,169 --> 00:45:11,379
..I swear to God, I won't. Give me the flying -

550
00:45:11,880 --> 00:45:14,174
I wanna play Tinkerbell...

551
00:45:14,174 --> 00:45:16,676
...in a drag in a fungoid
production of Peter Pan.

552
00:45:16,676 --> 00:45:18,803
Can I help you with anything, sir?

553
00:45:19,554 --> 00:45:21,306
Medication is indicated here.

554
00:45:21,681 --> 00:45:23,266
Colonel Fell isn't back yet, sir.

555
00:45:23,558 --> 00:45:25,894
Yeah he isn't up, like you know where he is?
He's up there with my flying-belt.

556
00:45:26,102 --> 00:45:29,522
You're giving me back my flying-belt!
I want my flying-belt back!

557
00:45:32,233 --> 00:45:35,320
Michael, I want you to be calm.
I want you to be calm.

558
00:45:35,445 --> 00:45:39,115
There are lots of sick people in this house,
and many of them are sleeping.

559
00:45:39,407 --> 00:45:41,701
This is embarrasing, I'm terribly sorry.

560
00:45:52,837 --> 00:45:54,923
- Captain Cutshaw.
- Vincent.

561
00:45:56,633 --> 00:46:01,763
In order for life to appear spontaneously on earth...

562
00:46:02,430 --> 00:46:07,310
... there first had to be hundreds of
millions of protein molecules...

563
00:46:07,727 --> 00:46:11,314
- ...of the ninth configuration.
- Vincent.

564
00:46:12,565 --> 00:46:15,860
But given the size of the planet Earth...

565
00:46:16,569 --> 00:46:21,407
do you know how long it would take for
just one of these protein molecules...

566
00:46:21,574 --> 00:46:24,577
... to appear entirely by chance?

567
00:46:24,786 --> 00:46:26,663
Vincent...

568
00:46:27,539 --> 00:46:36,256
Roughly 10 to the 243rd power
billions of years.

569
00:46:37,882 --> 00:46:42,262
And I find that far far more fantastic...

570
00:46:42,887 --> 00:46:46,307
...than simply believing in God.

571
00:47:02,490 --> 00:47:03,449
Colonel, what are you...

572
00:47:07,871 --> 00:47:10,790
Shouldn't sleep like that; wrinkles the pants.

573
00:47:14,169 --> 00:47:16,880
- What time is it?
- 8:15.

574
00:47:17,547 --> 00:47:18,756
Got a word you were looking for me?

575
00:47:19,841 --> 00:47:21,509
Where were you?

576
00:47:21,509 --> 00:47:24,012
Personal matters,
I've got an uncle in trouble.

577
00:47:24,846 --> 00:47:26,639
Any way I can help?

578
00:47:26,931 --> 00:47:29,601
No, we're doing what we can.
Appreciate it though, thanks.
What's up?

579
00:47:34,272 --> 00:47:36,649
Captain Bennish could use some sedation.

580
00:47:39,027 --> 00:47:41,738
Please, might I have the duplicate
key to the drug-chest?

581
00:47:41,905 --> 00:47:43,448
We had to break into it..

582
00:47:43,615 --> 00:47:45,575
I think it'll be better if we both had a key.

583
00:47:45,825 --> 00:47:48,077
Boy you look beat... didn't you get sleep?

584
00:47:48,912 --> 00:47:52,749
Every time I dropped off, another
one of the men was at the door.

585
00:47:52,790 --> 00:47:55,418
- Keep it closed.
- No.

586
00:47:55,668 --> 00:47:58,588
They've got to be able to talk to
me every time they need to.

587
00:47:58,963 --> 00:47:59,964
It's upto you.

588
00:48:10,642 --> 00:48:11,976
Something wrong?

589
00:48:15,021 --> 00:48:16,314
Something right?

590
00:48:17,232 --> 00:48:19,859
- That dream.
- I didn't get you.

591
00:48:23,655 --> 00:48:27,116
I just flashed on this dream I keep having.

592
00:48:28,117 --> 00:48:30,453
Julius Caesar's wife said to Sigmund Freud,
you tell me yours and I'll tell you mine.

593
00:48:30,453 --> 00:48:32,705
- It isn't my dream.
- I didn't get you.

594
00:48:35,667 --> 00:48:39,712
I said...it isn't my dream.

595
00:48:40,255 --> 00:48:41,422
Was it rented?

596
00:48:49,889 --> 00:48:51,266
A patient of mine,

597
00:48:52,725 --> 00:48:54,644
a Colonel at Vietnam,

598
00:48:56,229 --> 00:49:01,734
he had this grotesque recurring nightmare.

599
00:49:03,695 --> 00:49:07,365
Something that happened to him in combat.

600
00:49:10,285 --> 00:49:12,829
Ever since he told me about it,

601
00:49:15,498 --> 00:49:16,958
I keep dreaming it.

602
00:49:17,750 --> 00:49:18,418
Jesus.

603
00:49:20,128 --> 00:49:21,296
Yeah, strange.

604
00:49:21,671 --> 00:49:24,382
Weird is the word..that's carrying
transferance a little far, isn't it?

605
00:49:27,594 --> 00:49:29,929
- It was my brother.
- The patient?

606
00:49:30,180 --> 00:49:31,556
- Yes.
- Oh my God.

607
00:49:31,723 --> 00:49:32,849
Twin brother?

608
00:49:35,018 --> 00:49:36,519
No.

609
00:49:39,063 --> 00:49:41,774
Yeah, but; that would still explain it,
wouldn't it? I mean a...

610
00:49:43,610 --> 00:49:45,778
You're psychically attuned.
You're brothers. You're close...

611
00:49:45,945 --> 00:49:48,615
- No, we're not.
- But you must be.

612
00:49:50,783 --> 00:49:52,410
Fell.

613
00:49:53,203 --> 00:49:55,955
Have you ever heard of 'Killer' Kane?

614
00:49:56,039 --> 00:49:57,081
Buck Rogers?

615
00:49:57,790 --> 00:50:01,669
No, 'Killer' Kane the Marine.

616
00:50:02,504 --> 00:50:05,965
Oh yeah, sure. The guerilla-warfare guy who
killed thirty-forty guys with his hands.

617
00:50:07,133 --> 00:50:08,134
More than that.

618
00:50:10,094 --> 00:50:11,137
What's the point?

619
00:50:13,515 --> 00:50:15,058
Me is my brother.

620
00:50:15,517 --> 00:50:16,518
Bullshit.

621
00:50:17,268 --> 00:50:18,186
No, it's true.

622
00:50:18,645 --> 00:50:19,229
You're kidding!

623
00:50:20,313 --> 00:50:21,773
I wish I were.

624
00:50:23,900 --> 00:50:25,318
Uh-oh; you two guys don't get along huh?

625
00:50:27,111 --> 00:50:28,446
What's the beef?

626
00:50:31,241 --> 00:50:32,367
He's a murderer.

627
00:50:32,951 --> 00:50:34,327
He's a Marine.

628
00:50:34,327 --> 00:50:36,913
He gets dropped behind the enemy
lines and does his duty.

629
00:50:37,247 --> 00:50:38,706
Just forget it.

630
00:50:38,915 --> 00:50:41,125
Are you sure you know what business you're in?

631
00:50:41,167 --> 00:50:44,337
These recruiting-office sergeants
can be pretty sneaky sometimes.

632
00:50:44,379 --> 00:50:47,173
Vincent...

633
00:50:48,341 --> 00:50:49,634
You a friend of Jane Fonda?

634
00:50:52,053 --> 00:50:53,805
- We're close.
- You're kidding.

635
00:50:54,430 --> 00:50:55,682
I'm kidding.

636
00:51:02,438 --> 00:51:03,398
Drugs.

637
00:51:05,567 --> 00:51:06,693
What was that?

638
00:51:07,443 --> 00:51:09,362
So many of these doctors get hooked on drugs.

639
00:51:15,410 --> 00:51:18,788
Hey, how is your brother by the way?
You know I met him once over in Korea.

640
00:51:19,539 --> 00:51:21,666
Kind of palled around, we guys; matter-of-fact.

641
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,419
I liked him. I liked him a helluva lot.

642
00:51:27,714 --> 00:51:28,673
He's dead.

643
00:51:29,841 --> 00:51:31,718
Oh, holy Christ. Hey, I'm sorry.

644
00:51:32,635 --> 00:51:34,429
- I'm really sorry.
- Its alright.

645
00:51:37,390 --> 00:51:38,433
Yes, come in.

646
00:51:39,434 --> 00:51:42,145
Colonel Kane,
could I see you for a second?

647
00:51:42,687 --> 00:51:44,314
Well I gotta go you guys, I'll see you later.

648
00:52:07,921 --> 00:52:12,342
To my darling, my dearest,
my flaming secret love.

649
00:52:13,218 --> 00:52:17,555
How I've hungered for this moment,
when I may rip away my mask...

650
00:52:18,139 --> 00:52:21,518
...and unburden by aching bleeding heart.

651
00:52:21,976 --> 00:52:27,774
My sweetest, I saw you but an instant; a semi-instant;
yet I knew I was your slave.

652
00:52:28,816 --> 00:52:35,448
Wondorous creature, I adore you!
You are sandalwood from Nineveh,
truffles from the moon...

653
00:52:36,241 --> 00:52:40,912
In my dreams, I am a madman.

654
00:52:41,287 --> 00:52:46,918
Yes! I rip away your dress, and then your bra,
and then your glasses, and I-

655
00:52:48,044 --> 00:52:51,047
- Groper, is this necessary?
- Look at the signature.

656
00:52:56,177 --> 00:52:58,972
Major Marvin Groper.

657
00:52:59,556 --> 00:53:03,768
Sir, I got phone call after phone call this
morning from broads who got letters like this one.

658
00:53:04,602 --> 00:53:06,145
Where did you get this?

659
00:53:07,105 --> 00:53:10,692
- Well sir, some of the women, they -
- Women?

660
00:53:11,317 --> 00:53:14,737
- Well, they happened to come here today and -
- Happened?

661
00:53:16,072 --> 00:53:17,198
Well sir; I asked them...

662
00:53:17,824 --> 00:53:19,742
- ...ones with the nice voices.
- Groper.

663
00:53:20,118 --> 00:53:23,121
They are ugly, sir!
Ugly as sin!

664
00:53:23,413 --> 00:53:27,542
And I think the bastard who wrote all those letters
needs some kind of punishment and restriction, sir!

665
00:53:28,459 --> 00:53:30,670
Who wrote this letter?

666
00:53:30,795 --> 00:53:33,423
Look at the envelope, sir.
The address...

667
00:53:33,715 --> 00:53:37,385
Sir, there's only one mind here who is this diabolical!

668
00:53:38,136 --> 00:53:44,726
See that? Its made up to look like its been mimeoed.
Like its part of a mass commercial mailing, sir.

669
00:53:45,476 --> 00:53:46,936
"To : Occupant"

670
00:53:51,941 --> 00:53:53,902
Some of this stuuff's just got to stop, sir.

671
00:53:54,819 --> 00:53:57,030
Maybe so, Groper. Yes.

672
00:53:58,031 --> 00:53:59,574
It's getting out of hand.

673
00:54:00,575 --> 00:54:01,618
Yes.

674
00:54:02,827 --> 00:54:06,164
Maybe we do need a few restrictions.

675
00:54:06,873 --> 00:54:08,166
Colonel.

676
00:54:10,043 --> 00:54:11,336
Colonel.

677
00:54:12,462 --> 00:54:14,589
 -I'm in trouble, I need help. Immediate help.
 -Take an enema; call me soon.

678
00:54:16,132 --> 00:54:18,259
Dr. Fell, you're wanted in surgery.

679
00:54:18,885 --> 00:54:20,512
I've been having an argument, a monster...

680
00:54:20,803 --> 00:54:23,139
...and I'll like you to settle it once and for all.

681
00:54:31,064 --> 00:54:33,525
Some Shakespearean-
Hold this please.

682
00:54:34,234 --> 00:54:36,361
Some Shakespearean scho -
Thank you.

683
00:54:38,029 --> 00:54:42,325
Some Shakespearean scholars say that when
Hamlet is pretending he's crazy...

684
00:54:42,534 --> 00:54:44,661
...he really is crazy,
Correct?

685
00:54:42,534 --> 00:54:44,661
That's right.

686
00:54:45,245 --> 00:54:48,706
Now other Shakespearean scholars
say that when Hamlet...

687
00:54:56,297 --> 00:54:59,467
Other Shakespearean scholars say that
when Hamlet is pretending to be nuts...

688
00:54:59,676 --> 00:55:03,304
...he really isn't nuts, its an act.
Please give me your opinion.

689
00:55:03,513 --> 00:55:05,807
I would like to hear your's first.

690
00:55:06,015 --> 00:55:09,060
Terrific psychiatrist.
That's class.

691
00:55:12,355 --> 00:55:13,815
Pretty...

692
00:55:15,024 --> 00:55:18,611
Why don't you go inoculate a fucking armadillo, Fell?

693
00:55:18,653 --> 00:55:20,738
No really, I'm interested. I'm terribly interested.

694
00:55:21,155 --> 00:55:26,619
Your interests are coextensive
with on Nero's ass on Sunday morning.

695
00:55:26,953 --> 00:55:28,538
Heady concept, Frankie.

696
00:55:30,331 --> 00:55:34,919
Now listen, Colonel.
considering how Hamlet is acting...

697
00:55:35,879 --> 00:55:38,089
...is he really and truly crazy?

698
00:55:38,089 --> 00:55:40,383
- Yes.
- No.

699
00:55:40,758 --> 00:55:43,052
You're both wrong.

700
00:55:45,263 --> 00:55:47,265
Now think what happens:

701
00:55:48,016 --> 00:55:51,227
First the father dies; then his girl leaves him flat.

702
00:55:51,477 --> 00:55:53,813
then there's the appearance by his father's ghost...

703
00:55:54,314 --> 00:55:58,610
...Bad enough, but then the ghost says he was murdered.
And by whom?

704
00:55:58,735 --> 00:56:03,114
By Hamlet's uncle, who recently married Hamlet's mother!

705
00:56:06,951 --> 00:56:09,579
Now that by itself is a helluva hangup;

706
00:56:09,662 --> 00:56:13,458
because Hamlet liked his mother...

707
00:56:15,126 --> 00:56:16,461
...a lot!

708
00:56:16,794 --> 00:56:19,005
But then we agreed than Hamlet's insane.

709
00:56:19,047 --> 00:56:20,590
No, he's not.

710
00:56:20,882 --> 00:56:23,051
He is pretending,
but...

711
00:56:23,718 --> 00:56:29,140
...if Hamlet hadn't pretended to be crazy,
he would have gone crazy.

712
00:56:35,730 --> 00:56:37,315
See, Hamlet isn't psycho.

713
00:56:38,024 --> 00:56:39,442
He's hanging on a brink.

714
00:56:40,735 --> 00:56:47,200
A little shove, a little teensy eensy little
eensy push, and the kid's gone! Bananas! Whacked out!

715
00:56:47,367 --> 00:56:50,995
So his unconscious mind makes
him do what keeps him sane...

716
00:56:51,496 --> 00:56:54,165
...namely acting like he's nuts!

717
00:56:55,250 --> 00:56:57,585
See 'Cause acting crazy...

718
00:56:58,545 --> 00:57:06,970
...is a way to let off steam; a way to
get rid of your fucking aggression. A way
to get rid of your fears and your terrors...

719
00:57:08,096 --> 00:57:14,853
If I did what Hamlet does in this play,
they'd lock me up; they'd put me in prison.
They'll punish me, sure!

720
00:57:16,312 --> 00:57:22,193
But him? Prince Royal Garbagemouth
gets away with murder. And why?

721
00:57:23,736 --> 00:57:26,281
Because nuts are not responsible!

722
00:57:26,322 --> 00:57:29,576
Meantime, the crazier Hamlet acts...

723
00:57:29,742 --> 00:57:34,581
the more he indulges himself,
the healthier he gets!

724
00:57:35,582 --> 00:57:39,127
- Yes. I think...
- I'm waiting.

725
00:57:41,588 --> 00:57:43,882
I think I agree with your theory.

726
00:57:44,007 --> 00:57:45,758
Yes! There!

727
00:57:45,842 --> 00:57:50,930
You see? You understand that now,
you dumb stupid idiot?

728
00:57:51,055 --> 00:57:53,766
From now on, we do the scene my way!

729
00:57:55,101 --> 00:57:56,477
Come on, Sir Lawrence.

730
00:57:56,895 --> 00:57:59,147
God bless your veins and your arteries, Colonel.

731
00:57:59,480 --> 00:58:01,566
Sir Lawrence,
you don't know shit...

732
00:58:03,651 --> 00:58:05,028
Did he buy it?

733
00:58:05,403 --> 00:58:09,324
Did he buy it?
Hell, I bought it.

734
00:58:10,408 --> 00:58:12,994
Billy, I think there is something wrong with us.

735
00:58:34,057 --> 00:58:35,767
Groper, get off the line.

736
00:58:37,018 --> 00:58:39,103
The Hamlet theory is correct.

737
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:47,529
Hello, coLonel Kane here.
Get me Captain Pendelton.

738
00:58:48,112 --> 00:58:50,532
Yes, the Quartermaster's office.

739
00:58:51,783 --> 00:58:53,159
Thank you.

740
00:58:56,037 --> 00:58:57,705
We'll need some supplies.

741
00:58:58,206 --> 00:58:59,290
What for?

742
00:59:00,792 --> 00:59:02,794
We're going to indulge the men.

743
00:59:04,963 --> 00:59:08,299
...just like the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel?

744
00:59:08,383 --> 00:59:11,177
Would you care to enter a comment
on the frog-man suit...

745
00:59:11,219 --> 00:59:13,471
... or the German Gestapo uniforms?

746
00:59:15,682 --> 00:59:17,141
You'll pick the uniforms...

747
00:59:18,017 --> 00:59:19,894
Sure, go ahead...

748
00:59:21,437 --> 00:59:22,772
Oh, I see.

749
00:59:24,732 --> 00:59:27,944
They want tp play
"Great Escape".

750
00:59:30,280 --> 00:59:33,575
And tunnels 1 and 2 are decoys.

751
00:59:38,329 --> 00:59:39,497
Jesus.

752
00:59:45,628 --> 00:59:47,547
- Some weather we are having...
- Jesus.

753
00:59:52,760 --> 00:59:54,929
You are out of uniform.

754
00:59:55,680 --> 00:59:56,931
Jesus.

755
01:00:01,603 --> 01:00:05,106
Out, take a hike. Out!

756
01:00:06,691 --> 01:00:09,527
And tell your stupid agent never
to waste any more of my time!

757
01:00:12,280 --> 01:00:14,115
Can you imagine? Look at that!

758
01:00:14,157 --> 01:00:17,285
Here I am casting Julius Caesar,
and what do they send me?

759
01:00:17,327 --> 01:00:18,828
A dog that lisps.

760
01:00:19,579 --> 01:00:22,248
Spinell, out. Get out.

761
01:00:23,333 --> 01:00:26,336
You too Nammack.
Get out now, get lost.

762
01:00:29,172 --> 01:00:31,466
Gimme a reason.
One good reason.

763
01:00:33,259 --> 01:00:34,302
Colonel, do me a favor? Please?

764
01:00:34,677 --> 01:00:38,848
Explain to this moron here that in none
of the plays of  Shakespeare...

765
01:00:38,890 --> 01:00:40,975
...can there be a part for Superman.

766
01:00:41,059 --> 01:00:44,229
There could be, the way I explained it.

767
01:00:44,229 --> 01:00:45,480
The way you explained! Jesus!

768
01:00:45,605 --> 01:00:47,232
You know what he wants? You want to hear?

769
01:00:47,273 --> 01:00:49,609
When the conspirators draw their knives,

770
01:00:49,609 --> 01:00:51,861
he wants to rescue Julius Caesar!

771
01:00:51,986 --> 01:00:56,741
Ready? Swoop down like a rocket, pick him
up and go hurdling mighty temples in one
single, incredible bound!

772
01:00:57,033 --> 01:01:01,287
Jesus, Nammack. Are you crazy?

773
01:01:02,163 --> 01:01:05,083
Gentlemen, who put the flies in my paint palette?

774
01:01:06,292 --> 01:01:07,293
Bananas!

775
01:01:08,962 --> 01:01:12,006
Krebs!
Next.

776
01:01:13,091 --> 01:01:16,678
Starlet. Look at this!
Did you bring any photographs, honey?

777
01:01:20,890 --> 01:01:22,392
Jesus.

778
01:01:23,434 --> 01:01:26,271
Go talk to your brother,
I think he has 'The Falling Sickness'.

779
01:01:37,490 --> 01:01:38,575
Put your head up.

780
01:01:41,703 --> 01:01:45,415
- I'm going to the roof.
- Let go of my stethoscope please.

781
01:01:45,498 --> 01:01:47,625
Will these people be staying for dinner?

782
01:01:47,625 --> 01:01:50,086
The cook is fixing Mexican.
He wants to know how many.

783
01:01:50,211 --> 01:01:52,005
I can't get this...the man just threw up.

784
01:01:53,590 --> 01:01:54,674
I gotta go check on him.

785
01:01:55,550 --> 01:01:57,510
Dr. Fromme, can I talk to you please?

786
01:02:01,472 --> 01:02:02,849
She bit me.

787
01:02:03,349 --> 01:02:06,811
I told her she was lousy and she bit me.

788
01:02:08,271 --> 01:02:10,231
Maybe, I ought to use penguins.

789
01:02:11,357 --> 01:02:14,777
You here that, dammit?
You can be replaced.

790
01:02:17,322 --> 01:02:20,074
The atoms in water have manners.

791
01:02:20,325 --> 01:02:24,162
Look. There he is.
Our heavenly shrink.

792
01:02:24,412 --> 01:02:27,749
You are ours and ours alone and no one else's.

793
01:02:27,999 --> 01:02:33,379
- Hip, hip...!
- Hurray!

794
01:03:03,076 --> 01:03:08,957
Colonel, what are you holding...?

795
01:03:09,374 --> 01:03:11,668
- Colonel, what are you...?
- Jesus! it is...

796
01:03:19,092 --> 01:03:22,136
Colonel, why do I have to wear this?

797
01:03:22,929 --> 01:03:23,596
What?

798
01:03:24,806 --> 01:03:26,599
I said why do I have to wear this?

799
01:03:27,600 --> 01:03:30,228
Its psychodrama, major.

800
01:03:31,354 --> 01:03:35,441
Roleplay.
A standard tool for therapy.

801
01:03:36,192 --> 01:03:40,363
The inmates are playing the role of Allied prisoners of war,

802
01:03:40,905 --> 01:03:43,199
attemping to tunnel their way through freedom.

803
01:03:43,199 --> 01:03:45,326
We are their captors.

804
01:03:45,326 --> 01:03:47,537
Bullshit,
we're their prisoners!

805
01:03:47,579 --> 01:03:50,331
A bunch of yellow-bellied goof-offs
    out there havin' a ball.

806
01:03:50,832 --> 01:03:54,169
Why should I have to help their fun,
I'm not a psychiatrist!

807
01:03:54,335 --> 01:03:57,005
Its a goddam chicken-shit crazy idea.

808
01:03:58,006 --> 01:04:00,967
Jesus! Jesus Crist, man!

809
01:04:01,342 --> 01:04:04,304
Why don't you love somebody just a little!

810
01:04:04,637 --> 01:04:06,848
Why don't you help somebody! Help them!

811
01:04:07,807 --> 01:04:10,101
help! For the love of Christ!!

812
01:04:10,435 --> 01:04:13,021
You green-soaked caterpillar-torturing bastard!

813
01:04:13,271 --> 01:04:16,774
You're going to wear that uniform,
sleep in it, bathe in it.

814
01:04:16,816 --> 01:04:20,820
Try to take it off and you'll die in it!
Is that clear!

815
01:04:51,309 --> 01:04:54,479
I claim this swamp for Poland!

816
01:04:55,146 --> 01:04:58,733
Major Groper, please get out of here.

817
01:04:58,983 --> 01:05:02,070
Immediately!
And keep that uniform clean.

818
01:05:10,745 --> 01:05:12,830
The man has a flag-fetish.

819
01:05:19,379 --> 01:05:23,716
Now, then Major Strasser.
Tomorrow night we're switching roles.

820
01:05:24,843 --> 01:05:28,012
You'll be the inmates and we'll be the guards.

821
01:05:28,429 --> 01:05:32,350
Here, study your part for tomorrow night's interrogation.

822
01:05:32,600 --> 01:05:35,728
Notice, incidentally, that you'll crack on page 3.

823
01:05:37,021 --> 01:05:37,981
Yes.

824
01:05:40,149 --> 01:05:41,150
Who are you?

825
01:05:44,237 --> 01:05:45,071
Who are you?

826
01:05:46,406 --> 01:05:49,242
You're too human to be human.

827
01:05:55,456 --> 01:05:56,749
I don't know.

828
01:05:58,334 --> 01:06:00,920
Maybe you're P.T. Barnum.

829
01:06:01,254 --> 01:06:03,464
P.T. Barnum slaughtered lambs.

830
01:06:04,215 --> 01:06:06,634
He put up a cage of side shows...

831
01:06:06,634 --> 01:06:09,137
...and he stuck in a panther and a lamb together.

832
01:06:09,179 --> 01:06:11,431
And there was never any trouble.

833
01:06:12,140 --> 01:06:14,934
Huddy, the public just went lollipops.

834
01:06:15,059 --> 01:06:19,939
Look, a panther and a lamb and they don't even argue!

835
01:06:20,190 --> 01:06:22,650
They don't even  discuss!

836
01:06:23,568 --> 01:06:26,946
But Hud,
what the public never knew...

837
01:06:27,488 --> 01:06:30,658
...was that it was never the same lamb.

838
01:06:30,700 --> 01:06:36,247
That fucking panther ate up a lamb every single
day at intermission for three hundred days,

839
01:06:36,289 --> 01:06:39,375
and then they shot him for asking for mint sauce.

840
01:06:41,503 --> 01:06:45,006
Animals are innocent.
Why should they suffer?

841
01:06:46,132 --> 01:06:49,177
Why should children suffer?
Will you tell me?

842
01:06:50,386 --> 01:06:53,515
Why should any baby have to suffer and die?

843
01:06:53,848 --> 01:06:54,891
Why should men?

844
01:06:55,850 --> 01:07:00,605
Oh, come on now.
Don't try that thing on me.

845
01:07:00,605 --> 01:07:02,565
You've got answers for it.

846
01:07:02,607 --> 01:07:04,901
Like: "Pain makes people noble"

847
01:07:04,943 --> 01:07:08,571
And how could man be more than a
talking, tennis playing panda bear...

848
01:07:08,613 --> 01:07:11,824
...if there weren't at least the
possibility of suffering?

849
01:07:11,991 --> 01:07:14,202
But what about animals, Hud?

850
01:07:14,202 --> 01:07:17,497
Does pain make turkeys noble?

851
01:07:17,539 --> 01:07:21,960
Why is all of creation based on dog eat dog,
and the little fish are eaten by the big fish?

852
01:07:22,126 --> 01:07:24,420
Animals screaming in pain.

853
01:07:24,420 --> 01:07:28,007
Our creation an open wound, a fucking slaughterhouse!

854
01:07:28,049 --> 01:07:30,468
- We've talked about that.
- Not enough!

855
01:07:30,468 --> 01:07:33,096
We said 'The original sin' might be the cause.

856
01:07:33,137 --> 01:07:35,723
Then why doesn't the Foot just
come down and tell us?

857
01:07:35,765 --> 01:07:38,226
Is Foot running short of tablets of stone?

858
01:07:38,268 --> 01:07:40,854
My Uncle Eddie owns a quarry;
I can get them for him wholesale.

859
01:07:40,979 --> 01:07:43,106
You're asking for miracles.

860
01:07:43,106 --> 01:07:46,317
I'm asking Foot to either
shit or get off the pot.

861
01:07:46,317 --> 01:07:49,487
Diarrhetic strange Gods have
been waiting in the line!

862
01:07:49,529 --> 01:07:52,115
Maybe God cannot interfere in our affairs.

863
01:07:52,115 --> 01:07:54,075
So I noticed.

864
01:07:54,117 --> 01:07:58,037
Maybe He can't because to do so
will spoil his plans for the future.

865
01:07:58,162 --> 01:08:02,667
Some evolution of man and the world
that's so unthinkably beautiful...

866
01:08:02,750 --> 01:08:06,337
...that its's worth all the pain of
every suffering thing that ever lived.

867
01:08:06,421 --> 01:08:08,840
I say it's spinach and to hell with it.

868
01:08:08,882 --> 01:08:11,426
You're convinced that God is dead
because there's evil in the world.

869
01:08:11,426 --> 01:08:12,635
Correct.

870
01:08:12,635 --> 01:08:15,763
Then why don't you think He's alive
because of the goodness in the world?

871
01:08:15,805 --> 01:08:18,808
- What goodness?
- Every where! In man.

872
01:08:18,850 --> 01:08:22,812
- You're commendable.
- If we're nothing but atoms...

873
01:08:22,854 --> 01:08:27,192
molecular structures no different
in kind from this desk or that pen,

874
01:08:27,275 --> 01:08:30,278
Then we ought to always be rushing
irresestibly blindly...

875
01:08:30,320 --> 01:08:32,906
...to our own selfish ends?

876
01:08:33,281 --> 01:08:36,451
So how is it that there is love in this world?

877
01:08:36,659 --> 01:08:39,662
I mean love as a God might love.

878
01:08:39,704 --> 01:08:43,291
- And a man will give his life for another.
- Never happened.

879
01:08:43,333 --> 01:08:44,375
Ofcourse it's happened.

880
01:08:44,584 --> 01:08:47,045
- Give me an example.
- Happens all the time.

881
01:08:47,128 --> 01:08:49,255
Name one example!

882
01:08:51,424 --> 01:08:57,347
A soldier throws himself on top of a live grenade
to prevent the other men in his squad from being hit.

883
01:08:57,388 --> 01:08:59,516
That's reflex action.

884
01:08:59,557 --> 01:09:02,310
A shipwreck survivor in the middle of an ocean...

885
01:09:02,310 --> 01:09:05,438
... finds out that he has typhoid...

886
01:09:05,480 --> 01:09:07,899
... and deliberately goes over
 the side of the life-boat...

887
01:09:07,899 --> 01:09:11,069
... to keep the others in the
boat from contracting the disease.

888
01:09:11,069 --> 01:09:13,196
Now, what do you call that? Reflex action?

889
01:09:13,238 --> 01:09:15,365
No, I call that suicide.

890
01:09:15,365 --> 01:09:17,992
Suicide and giving up your life are not the same.

891
01:09:18,034 --> 01:09:19,786
You're so dumb you're adorable.

892
01:09:19,786 --> 01:09:22,121
The essence of suicide is dispair.

893
01:09:22,121 --> 01:09:25,375
The essence of suicide is you
don't collect the insurance.

894
01:09:25,458 --> 01:09:29,379
Listen, who doesn't know what all these
examples we keep on hearing about aren't bullshit?

895
01:09:29,504 --> 01:09:32,799
And don't have some basically bullshit selfish explanation?

896
01:09:33,049 --> 01:09:34,843
- I know.
- I don't.

897
01:09:35,301 --> 01:09:39,013
Now give me just one example - just one -
that you know of personally.

898
01:09:39,472 --> 01:09:41,599
Personally, just one!

899
01:09:54,195 --> 01:09:55,655
I thought as much.

900
01:10:05,498 --> 01:10:09,669
Tomorrow's Sunday. Take me to Mass.

901
01:10:28,688 --> 01:10:31,900
Would Foot give a shit about what I'm wearing?

902
01:10:40,283 --> 01:10:42,118
Is that Edgar Cayce?

903
01:10:53,630 --> 01:10:56,591
If anyone enters by me, he will be saved.

904
01:10:56,716 --> 01:11:01,679
The thief comes only to steal,
to kill, and destroy.

905
01:11:02,263 --> 01:11:07,060
But I have come that they may have life,
life in all its fullness.

906
01:11:07,727 --> 01:11:10,063
That the father knows me,

907
01:11:10,063 --> 01:11:13,358
and I know the Father,
in the same way I know my sheep,

908
01:11:13,358 --> 01:11:16,778
and they know me, and I am willing to die for them.

909
01:11:16,819 --> 01:11:18,947
"I have given YOU an example"

910
01:11:18,988 --> 01:11:22,784
I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd
gives his life for his sheep.

911
01:12:11,332 --> 01:12:14,919
Infinite goodness is creating a being...

912
01:12:14,961 --> 01:12:19,924
...that you know in advance is going to complain.

913
01:12:22,927 --> 01:12:26,973
"To be or not to be"

914
01:12:30,602 --> 01:12:32,270
Thanks, I dug it.

915
01:12:40,528 --> 01:12:42,822
If you die first and there's life after death,

916
01:12:42,906 --> 01:12:45,116
...will you give me a sign?

917
01:12:45,783 --> 01:12:48,620
- I'll try.
- You're terrific.

918
01:12:52,582 --> 01:12:54,709
Did Cutshaw behave himself?

919
01:12:54,751 --> 01:12:57,128
As usual. Where are you going?

920
01:12:57,170 --> 01:13:00,548
To the beach. The diner down there serves
great eggs Benedict. You'd like to come?

921
01:13:01,716 --> 01:13:05,553
- Yeah, it's my favorite food.
- Why don't you come along?

922
01:13:07,555 --> 01:13:11,518
No, thanks. I feel tired. I think
I'm going to lie down for a while.

923
01:13:12,101 --> 01:13:13,311
- Excuse me.
- Sure.

924
01:13:15,480 --> 01:13:17,857
I was hoping you'd come along and pick up the check.

925
01:13:17,857 --> 01:13:20,193
- Colonel...
- Goddamit!

926
01:13:25,573 --> 01:13:27,742
Is there any news from earth?

927
01:13:27,742 --> 01:13:28,952
I'm sorry.

928
01:13:30,203 --> 01:13:31,704
Any letters?

929
01:13:31,746 --> 01:13:35,041
- Your planet has demanded your return.
- Fuck that.

930
01:13:35,083 --> 01:13:36,709
Any packages?

931
01:13:36,876 --> 01:13:40,421
When I was on Mars my mother
sent me a cheesecake once a month.

932
01:13:40,463 --> 01:13:43,383
She used to pack it in popcorn to keep it moist.

933
01:13:43,383 --> 01:13:46,594
All that shit about canals on Mars is a myth.

934
01:13:46,594 --> 01:13:49,138
Mars is drier than an armpit in hell.

935
01:13:49,180 --> 01:13:50,473
Yes, I know.

936
01:13:50,765 --> 01:13:53,518
But not here! Here it's nice.

937
01:13:55,520 --> 01:13:58,231
Well Ok, I'm sealing off my mind.

938
01:14:17,959 --> 01:14:19,419
Colonel Kane.

939
01:14:23,673 --> 01:14:26,301
- Yes?
- New inmate, sir.

940
01:14:26,426 --> 01:14:30,430
He got in about half an hour ago.
I put him in your office.

941
01:14:31,222 --> 01:14:35,059
I didn't think you'd want him mixing
with the others until you'd -

942
01:14:35,143 --> 01:14:37,395
well - sort ofexplained things to him.

943
01:14:38,813 --> 01:14:41,316
He seems pretty straight to me, sir.

944
01:14:41,399 --> 01:14:43,693
Just combat fatigue, from the look of him.

945
01:14:44,736 --> 01:14:48,031
-Thanks Krebs, I'll see him in a minute.
-Right, sir.

946
01:15:14,182 --> 01:15:15,600
Jesus.

947
01:15:18,436 --> 01:15:19,979
'Killer' Kane!

948
01:15:27,570 --> 01:15:30,907
Colonel, Colonel. Its me, Gilman!

949
01:15:32,534 --> 01:15:33,493
Come on, let's go.

950
01:15:35,245 --> 01:15:36,788
Hey, you got a Charlie.

951
01:15:37,539 --> 01:15:40,792
- Just a boy.
- Forget about it sir, let's get out of here...

952
01:15:41,376 --> 01:15:44,045
I cut off his head with a wire...

953
01:15:44,170 --> 01:15:46,339
...and he kept on talking.

954
01:15:46,631 --> 01:15:48,299
What're you holding?

955
01:15:48,925 --> 01:15:50,677
What's there in your -

956
01:15:51,386 --> 01:15:53,638
Jesus!

957
01:16:07,402 --> 01:16:09,529
Christ, this is obviously mistake, sir.

958
01:16:10,154 --> 01:16:13,366
Some computer must have goofed up.
It puts you down as...

959
01:16:13,700 --> 01:16:16,703
... incharge of the state asylum...

960
01:16:17,161 --> 01:16:21,541
...your MOS as 'Psychiatrist'.
Your serial number's wrong...

961
01:16:22,625 --> 01:16:24,794
There must be another Colonel Kane.

962
01:16:27,755 --> 01:16:31,467
There must be another Colonel Kane.

963
01:16:38,933 --> 01:16:40,602
Vincent.

964
01:17:12,091 --> 01:17:15,386
Tell me again about goodness in the world.

965
01:17:15,887 --> 01:17:18,306
You lying bloody butchering bastard!

966
01:17:20,517 --> 01:17:25,188
Don't touch me, don't come near me.
There's your brother up there.

967
01:17:25,522 --> 01:17:29,317
There's your bloody green-soaked brother
that's Kane. That's 'Killer' Kane!

968
01:17:29,317 --> 01:17:31,903
He'll cut your fucking head off with a wire!

969
01:17:53,550 --> 01:17:55,635
I needed you!

970
01:18:11,359 --> 01:18:14,904
- What happened?
- You fainted, don't you remember?

971
01:18:21,411 --> 01:18:22,954
What do you remember?

972
01:18:24,914 --> 01:18:26,207
I don't know.

973
01:18:28,585 --> 01:18:29,878
Nothing.

974
01:18:31,504 --> 01:18:33,715
I was walking to my room...

975
01:18:35,175 --> 01:18:37,343
You remember the new inmate?

976
01:18:39,470 --> 01:18:41,389
New inmate?

977
01:18:44,559 --> 01:18:46,227
You don't remember.

978
01:18:46,519 --> 01:18:48,771
What the hell are you talking about?

979
01:18:57,989 --> 01:19:00,617
Groper, who was that?

980
01:19:04,204 --> 01:19:05,830
Cutshaw, sir.

981
01:19:30,313 --> 01:19:32,649
When Kane got the orders, he was...

982
01:19:32,732 --> 01:19:36,194
... he was commanding a Special
Forces camp just south of DMZ.

983
01:19:37,529 --> 01:19:40,406
By the time he got to the States,
they'd caught the mistake.

984
01:19:40,448 --> 01:19:42,909
But by then it was clear he
meant to go through with it.

985
01:19:43,576 --> 01:19:45,411
We've been watching him.

986
01:19:46,454 --> 01:19:49,666
We heard the - we heard the stories about his cracking.

987
01:19:50,625 --> 01:19:55,171
He seemed to be on the edge of a
very serious breakdown, and then...

988
01:19:56,381 --> 01:20:00,802
...one computer dropped the stitch
and gave a halfway out:

989
01:20:01,219 --> 01:20:04,597
A way to find help without facing his illness;

990
01:20:04,848 --> 01:20:07,350
A way to hide from himself;

991
01:20:08,142 --> 01:20:09,936
But mostly...

992
01:20:11,771 --> 01:20:16,359
Mostly a way to wash away all the blood:

993
01:20:17,777 --> 01:20:21,614
a way to do penance for all
the killing - by curing.

994
01:20:21,906 --> 01:20:24,576
At first, it was just a pretense but...

995
01:20:25,785 --> 01:20:29,289
...on the way back from Viet Nam
it developed into something more.

996
01:20:29,664 --> 01:20:32,834
His hatred of the Kane who killed became denial,

997
01:20:32,834 --> 01:20:34,586
and also projection:

998
01:20:34,627 --> 01:20:37,797
'Someone else must have done all the killing'.

999
01:20:38,214 --> 01:20:41,509
Then after a time the denial became so strong that...

1000
01:20:41,676 --> 01:20:44,929
...it totally obliterated Kane's identity.

1001
01:20:44,971 --> 01:20:47,182
He suppressed the Kane who was the killer,

1002
01:20:47,182 --> 01:20:50,268
and became the better-self that's in all of us.

1003
01:20:50,310 --> 01:20:51,644
Completely.

1004
01:20:52,812 --> 01:20:54,856
Except when he dreamed.

1005
01:21:05,408 --> 01:21:07,368
We were experimenting, you see...

1006
01:21:08,536 --> 01:21:11,456
He was on the inside, looking out.

1007
01:21:11,581 --> 01:21:14,167
An inmate functioning as a psychiatrist...

1008
01:21:14,167 --> 01:21:17,295
...and coming to bear on the problem
like nothing we'd ever seen before.

1009
01:21:17,921 --> 01:21:22,342
We hoped he might come up with a new
answer, or atleast some new insight.

1010
01:21:23,301 --> 01:21:24,719
And I think he did.

1011
01:21:25,428 --> 01:21:27,805
I think the men have been responding to him.

1012
01:21:29,474 --> 01:21:36,814
But he suffered a setback today. And a bad one.
...You see, his only hope of finding cure
for himself is ...

1013
01:21:37,065 --> 01:21:40,610
...to wipe away the guilt by a saving act...

1014
01:21:41,736 --> 01:21:43,863
by curing the other inmates,

1015
01:21:44,989 --> 01:21:47,325
or atleast see some improvement.

1016
01:21:49,536 --> 01:21:51,579
But that takes time.

1017
01:21:52,789 --> 01:21:54,082
Time and your help.

1018
01:21:54,624 --> 01:21:58,253
And you've seen my orders. But I
want Kane to play out the string.
You understand?

1019
01:21:58,461 --> 01:22:00,088
- Lieutenant Gilman.
- Yes, sir.

1020
01:22:00,129 --> 01:22:06,469
I'd like you to try to convince the other inmates
that you were mistaken. That shouldn't be too
hard to sell around here? Will you do that?

1021
01:22:07,053 --> 01:22:08,221
Oh yeah, sure.

1022
01:22:11,182 --> 01:22:14,561
Groper, Krebs, Christian and the
others will back you up. So will I.

1023
01:22:17,313 --> 01:22:18,773
Colonel.

1024
01:22:20,066 --> 01:22:22,819
Let me get something straight.

1025
01:22:24,612 --> 01:22:27,991
You've been incharge here, all the time.

1026
01:22:29,075 --> 01:22:30,326
That's right.

1027
01:22:31,286 --> 01:22:34,038
Kane is Vincent Kane.
I'm Hudson.

1028
01:22:35,123 --> 01:22:36,541
I'm the psychiatrist.

1029
01:22:37,625 --> 01:22:39,752
Vincent is my patient.

1030
01:22:45,633 --> 01:22:49,512
When we ah - when we were kids
I used to make him laugh all the time.

1031
01:22:49,888 --> 01:22:51,931
I was the clown, you know.

1032
01:22:54,100 --> 01:22:57,437
And I've been trying to help
him remember me. But he won't do it.

1033
01:22:59,856 --> 01:23:01,065
He's my brother.

1034
01:23:45,985 --> 01:23:51,449
Hey waitress, could I have a runway
for the young lady and one more scotch.

1035
01:23:51,491 --> 01:23:54,369
Sir, you've got five right there in front of you.

1036
01:23:56,079 --> 01:23:57,747
I wanted six.

1037
01:23:59,457 --> 01:24:00,500
Quiet.

1038
01:24:01,334 --> 01:24:03,545
That's him. I know that's him.

1039
01:24:03,670 --> 01:24:07,507
- You're demented.
- Up yours! I've seen his picture in the paper.

1040
01:24:09,676 --> 01:24:11,594
You don't read papers, Stanley.

1041
01:24:11,761 --> 01:24:15,723
- You're an illiterate.
- Then TV, you asshole!

1042
01:24:15,807 --> 01:24:17,934
Look at him! Look at his face!

1043
01:24:18,059 --> 01:24:20,645
He's the astronaut,
the one that lost his marbles!

1044
01:24:20,728 --> 01:24:23,398
What's he doin' in a joint like this?

1045
01:24:23,398 --> 01:24:25,567
Now, how the fuck do I know?

1046
01:24:25,817 --> 01:24:29,571
Dude, they have all types of those army
whackos stashed up in that Biltmore dump!

1047
01:24:29,612 --> 01:24:31,906
What if it could be one of them?
I don't know!

1048
01:24:32,490 --> 01:24:36,077
But that's him, I swear.
I'm positive.

1049
01:24:36,286 --> 01:24:39,247
How positive is positive, Stanley?

1050
01:24:40,540 --> 01:24:41,708
You wanna bet?

1051
01:24:43,042 --> 01:24:44,419
Yeah, how much?

1052
01:24:48,047 --> 01:24:52,385
Just a beer and a shot in the mouth.

1053
01:24:55,471 --> 01:24:56,681
Lead on.

1054
01:24:57,390 --> 01:24:59,601
I think he's kinda cute.

1055
01:25:02,353 --> 01:25:06,566
- I told you not to smoke!
- Hey Steve, two beers and two bourbon rocks.

1056
01:25:17,827 --> 01:25:19,329
You desire an audience?

1057
01:25:19,954 --> 01:25:21,789
What's your name?

1058
01:25:24,083 --> 01:25:25,710
Rumpelstiltskin.

1059
01:25:28,546 --> 01:25:31,424
- Wise-ass.
- A literate.

1060
01:25:33,009 --> 01:25:34,219
Your name.

1061
01:25:35,470 --> 01:25:37,555
My maiden name or married?

1062
01:25:38,598 --> 01:25:40,141
Too literate.

1063
01:25:41,434 --> 01:25:43,061
Waitress!

1064
01:25:46,898 --> 01:25:48,566
See? Marines.

1065
01:25:48,942 --> 01:25:51,069
USMC.

1066
01:25:51,819 --> 01:25:54,447
Unbridled Sex for the Masters Clubs.

1067
01:25:58,117 --> 01:25:59,953
Is it something I said?

1068
01:26:00,203 --> 01:26:04,832
If I lose this bet Richard, I'm
going to punch him in the mouth.

1069
01:26:05,416 --> 01:26:08,461
One more scotch and two spittoons, love,

1070
01:26:08,753 --> 01:26:11,589
Fill them with caterpillar's blood.
My friends here are very...

1071
01:26:12,048 --> 01:26:13,258
Hey, cut that out!

1072
01:26:27,730 --> 01:26:29,524
It's him.

1073
01:26:29,899 --> 01:26:31,651
It's really him.

1074
01:26:31,693 --> 01:26:35,029
I got his dog tags Richard, its him!

1075
01:26:35,238 --> 01:26:37,699
The bigshit astronaut.

1076
01:26:38,199 --> 01:26:39,617
My God!

1077
01:26:40,994 --> 01:26:44,914
Hey! Everybody!
Guess what we've got here...

1078
01:26:45,248 --> 01:26:49,335
A damned celebrity!
A chicken, wigged-out astronaut!

1079
01:26:57,510 --> 01:27:03,933
This here is Captain Billy Cutshaw,
brothers and sisters.

1080
01:27:08,229 --> 01:27:09,480
Oh my God.

1081
01:27:12,150 --> 01:27:13,776
Now I propose...

1082
01:27:16,654 --> 01:27:24,037
I propose that we make him an
honorary member of our club.

1083
01:27:29,375 --> 01:27:31,127
Now that's friendly!

1084
01:27:35,548 --> 01:27:37,800
Would you like to join our club?

1085
01:27:38,718 --> 01:27:40,303
Fuck you.

1086
01:27:52,524 --> 01:27:54,943
Okay. Don't fuck you.

1087
01:28:06,454 --> 01:28:10,625
Now this is what I learnt in the boyscouts.

1088
01:28:17,048 --> 01:28:19,175
Hello? Could you help me please?

1089
01:28:19,300 --> 01:28:22,220
Do you have a listing for some kind of asylum -

1090
01:28:22,804 --> 01:28:29,936
...could you maybe invite Charlie Price and
Dick Cooey and Jeniffer and -

1091
01:28:31,938 --> 01:28:33,815
I'm sorry...

1092
01:28:34,274 --> 01:28:38,319
Do you have a number for some kind
of asylum for marines or something?

1093
01:28:39,237 --> 01:28:42,740
First, we must baptize the chicken-mother.

1094
01:28:45,118 --> 01:28:49,122
- Richard, you may have the honors.
- Thank you, Stanley.

1095
01:28:50,164 --> 01:28:51,624
Lets have a countdown.

1096
01:28:52,208 --> 01:29:02,218
10, 9, 8, 7, 6,
5, 4, 3, 2, 1..

1097
01:29:02,677 --> 01:29:04,554
Splash down!

1098
01:29:13,563 --> 01:29:17,942
Everything A-O.K. there, spaceman?

1099
01:29:20,737 --> 01:29:24,991
Could you polish your chains,
they're old and little cruddy

1100
01:29:56,731 --> 01:30:00,151
Welcome...to the club.

1101
01:30:01,236 --> 01:30:02,403
Colonel Kane.

1102
01:30:03,404 --> 01:30:05,031
No, I'm on.

1103
01:30:10,703 --> 01:30:12,580
Where are you located?

1104
01:30:13,581 --> 01:30:22,048
5, 4, 3, 2, 1...

1105
01:30:22,841 --> 01:30:25,218
Splash down!

1106
01:30:28,054 --> 01:30:29,347
Again!

1107
01:30:30,640 --> 01:30:36,229
10, 9, 8, 7...

1108
01:30:52,161 --> 01:30:53,413
Cutshaw.

1109
01:30:55,331 --> 01:30:58,376
- Been meeting your family.
- I think it's his keeper.

1110
01:31:00,420 --> 01:31:03,798
I think we got us a new beach ball.

1111
01:31:07,051 --> 01:31:08,052
Come on.

1112
01:31:10,180 --> 01:31:12,599
That's my beach ball, man.
Put it down.

1113
01:31:13,516 --> 01:31:14,893
Yeah, you tell him, Stan.

1114
01:31:14,893 --> 01:31:19,272
- You better call the M.P.s!
- Nah, the S.P.s: that's the Shit Patrol!

1115
01:31:21,399 --> 01:31:23,484
Here's your goodness in man.

1116
01:31:24,611 --> 01:31:25,820
Did you talk?

1117
01:31:27,155 --> 01:31:29,616
I think the beach ball here just said something!

1118
01:31:33,119 --> 01:31:35,163
Did you talk?

1119
01:31:35,455 --> 01:31:36,706
Let go of him, please.

1120
01:31:38,249 --> 01:31:41,503
You, let go of my beach ball.

1121
01:31:42,420 --> 01:31:44,464
Please let us go.

1122
01:31:44,714 --> 01:31:46,049
Pretty please.

1123
01:31:48,426 --> 01:31:49,511
Pretty please?

1124
01:31:52,889 --> 01:31:54,140
Now say...

1125
01:31:56,309 --> 01:31:58,520
... "Marines are chicken."

1126
01:32:08,655 --> 01:32:11,533
Come on, say it.

1127
01:32:14,577 --> 01:32:15,370
Marines...

1128
01:32:16,329 --> 01:32:17,080
Let's finish it.

1129
01:32:20,208 --> 01:32:21,125
Marines are chicken.

1130
01:32:23,878 --> 01:32:26,089
Wait wait, just two more.

1131
01:32:34,097 --> 01:32:35,390
Now say...

1132
01:32:35,723 --> 01:32:38,810
"Marines all suck."

1133
01:32:45,358 --> 01:32:46,276
Now come on.

1134
01:32:48,528 --> 01:32:50,864
You're gonna say it and get outta here?

1135
01:32:52,365 --> 01:32:54,868
Go on, now. Say it.

1136
01:32:57,954 --> 01:33:03,376
Say it:"Marines all suck."

1137
01:33:06,129 --> 01:33:07,589
And you can go.

1138
01:33:20,810 --> 01:33:22,353
Marines...

1139
01:33:25,023 --> 01:33:27,734
Come on, let's finish it.

1140
01:33:30,403 --> 01:33:31,863
Marines...

1141
01:33:34,782 --> 01:33:36,492
Marines...

1142
01:33:38,661 --> 01:33:39,871
...all...suck.

1143
01:33:43,750 --> 01:33:45,877
Let's play beach ball!

1144
01:33:48,630 --> 01:33:53,426
U.S.M.C.!

1145
01:33:54,260 --> 01:33:59,432
U.S.M.C.!

1146
01:34:02,477 --> 01:34:04,103
Ah, it's break time! Isn't that so?

1147
01:34:05,396 --> 01:34:17,033
U.S.M.C.!, U.S.M.C.!

1148
01:34:18,826 --> 01:34:20,245
The marines have landed.

1149
01:34:20,453 --> 01:34:22,956
You want a little drink, lunar boy?

1150
01:34:25,208 --> 01:34:28,002
- Richard, get me a beer-
- Coming up.

1151
01:34:28,753 --> 01:34:30,213
Uh-oh, here comes Stanley.

1152
01:34:52,402 --> 01:34:54,028
Fucking slob.

1153
01:34:55,321 --> 01:34:57,365
Now clean up the mess.

1154
01:35:08,626 --> 01:35:10,420
I'm on vacation!

1155
01:35:20,722 --> 01:35:22,056
Now lick it.

1156
01:35:22,724 --> 01:35:23,850
Lick it!

1157
01:35:25,101 --> 01:35:26,227
Lick it!

1158
01:35:28,813 --> 01:35:30,231
Hey, cut that out!

1159
01:35:33,067 --> 01:35:34,027
Lick it.

1160
01:35:34,903 --> 01:35:36,487
And I'll let you both go.

1161
01:35:37,322 --> 01:35:38,740
You and your friend.

1162
01:35:41,492 --> 01:35:42,702
Now lick it.

1163
01:35:53,755 --> 01:35:55,006
Lick it.

1164
01:36:03,431 --> 01:36:05,141
Jesus Christ.

1165
01:36:05,975 --> 01:36:09,312
Chicken-shit turd.
He did it!

1166
01:36:23,326 --> 01:36:24,494
Scum.

1167
01:36:28,456 --> 01:36:31,751
That's for disgracing the fucking uniform.

1168
01:36:31,751 --> 01:36:33,086
You bastards!

1169
01:36:33,336 --> 01:36:35,630
- Sons of bitches!
- Get him down.

1170
01:36:35,755 --> 01:36:38,216
Get him down on the floor. I got a present for him.

1171
01:36:52,272 --> 01:36:54,232
Hold the bastard steady.

1172
01:37:00,738 --> 01:37:02,115
Hold him down, will ya?

1173
01:37:08,913 --> 01:37:12,166
- How're you doing, Richard?
- That guy's a fighter.

1174
01:37:14,544 --> 01:37:16,671
I think he wants some more...

1175
01:37:31,728 --> 01:37:32,604
Oh my God.

1176
01:37:46,117 --> 01:37:47,493
What the fuck...

1177
01:37:58,087 --> 01:37:58,963
You son of a -

1178
01:38:51,750 --> 01:38:54,461
- Come on, Coronel.
- You said yourself he was provoked.

1179
01:38:54,503 --> 01:38:57,715
- Yeah, but he also...
- No, goddammit! He stays!

1180
01:39:09,810 --> 01:39:11,729
We're taking him in, sir.

1181
01:39:12,646 --> 01:39:14,690
Sorry, but we are.

1182
01:39:14,899 --> 01:39:18,652
And you can either produce him,
or we'll find him ourselves.

1183
01:39:27,661 --> 01:39:28,662
Come on, Frank.

1184
01:39:32,791 --> 01:39:34,793
Better hold it right there pal.

1185
01:39:47,598 --> 01:39:48,766
Colonel?

1186
01:40:10,579 --> 01:40:12,456
Colonel Kane, Sir.

1187
01:40:21,841 --> 01:40:24,260
Has anybody told Ann?

1188
01:40:27,012 --> 01:40:30,224
- Ann?
- My wife.

1189
01:40:34,520 --> 01:40:38,440
No, its alright.

1190
01:40:42,027 --> 01:40:43,904
Where's Gilman?

1191
01:40:46,949 --> 01:40:49,243
He's downstairs, sir.

1192
01:40:50,077 --> 01:40:51,453
Is he alright?

1193
01:40:55,124 --> 01:40:58,169
Yes, sir. He's fine sir.

1194
01:41:02,006 --> 01:41:03,340
Cutshaw.

1195
01:41:04,133 --> 01:41:05,676
Yes, sir?

1196
01:41:07,636 --> 01:41:10,556
Why won't you go to the moon?

1197
01:41:26,113 --> 01:41:28,282
Because I'm afraid.

1198
01:41:30,075 --> 01:41:31,368
Afraid?

1199
01:41:33,704 --> 01:41:35,623
That's right, sir.

1200
01:41:39,960 --> 01:41:42,338
See the stars...

1201
01:41:43,672 --> 01:41:46,050
So cold...

1202
01:41:46,675 --> 01:41:48,886
So far...

1203
01:41:50,513 --> 01:41:52,932
and so very lonely.

1204
01:41:54,099 --> 01:41:56,519
Oh, so lonely.

1205
01:41:57,770 --> 01:41:59,647
All that space...

1206
01:42:01,565 --> 01:42:04,318
just empty space.

1207
01:42:07,321 --> 01:42:09,573
and so...far way from home.

1208
01:42:13,536 --> 01:42:15,788
I've circled round...

1209
01:42:15,955 --> 01:42:18,958
...and round this house.

1210
01:42:20,167 --> 01:42:22,211
Orbit...

1211
01:42:22,711 --> 01:42:24,380
...after orbit.

1212
01:42:26,966 --> 01:42:29,176
And sometimes I wonder...

1213
01:42:30,553 --> 01:42:35,474
...what it would be like never to stop.

1214
01:42:37,726 --> 01:42:40,312
and circle alone up there...

1215
01:42:41,856 --> 01:42:43,524
...forever.

1216
01:42:46,068 --> 01:42:48,362
And what if I got there,

1217
01:42:50,489 --> 01:42:52,616
got to the moon,

1218
01:42:58,205 --> 01:43:00,374
and couldn't get back?

1219
01:43:02,459 --> 01:43:05,421
Sure, everyone dies.

1220
01:43:07,548 --> 01:43:10,217
but I'm afraid to die alone...

1221
01:43:10,718 --> 01:43:13,095
...so far from home.

1222
01:43:16,098 --> 01:43:18,517
And if there's no God..

1223
01:43:20,436 --> 01:43:22,646
then that's really...

1224
01:43:23,355 --> 01:43:25,441
...really...

1225
01:43:25,691 --> 01:43:27,818
...alone.

1226
01:43:52,051 --> 01:43:54,261
Not...much time.

1227
01:43:57,640 --> 01:43:59,517
Time.

1228
01:44:01,310 --> 01:44:03,437
No time.

1229
01:44:07,650 --> 01:44:09,777
But I'll show you...

1230
01:44:11,529 --> 01:44:16,283
But I'll show you...God exists.

1231
01:44:21,372 --> 01:44:23,582
That's right, sir...

1232
01:44:26,210 --> 01:44:29,880
One example...

1233
01:44:36,345 --> 01:44:38,806
And the others...

1234
01:44:39,974 --> 01:44:42,601
maybe...

1235
01:44:43,143 --> 01:44:45,271
help.

1236
01:44:45,896 --> 01:44:48,649
Try to cure...

1237
01:44:49,817 --> 01:44:53,654
Try to cure them too.

1238
01:44:55,155 --> 01:44:57,199
I don't know.

1239
01:45:02,371 --> 01:45:04,707
No other way now.

1240
01:45:07,459 --> 01:45:09,503
Time.

1241
01:45:12,673 --> 01:45:14,717
No time.

1242
01:45:18,596 --> 01:45:21,640
Had to try...

1243
01:45:23,267 --> 01:45:25,060
Shock...

1244
01:45:25,686 --> 01:45:28,480
shock treatment.

1245
01:45:41,327 --> 01:45:43,537
What was that, sir?

1246
01:45:51,879 --> 01:45:53,214
Tired.

1247
01:45:58,260 --> 01:45:59,386
Tired.

1248
01:46:08,270 --> 01:46:09,855
Oh, God.

1249
01:46:11,065 --> 01:46:13,192
I love -

1250
01:48:02,510 --> 01:48:04,220
Oh God.

1251
01:48:04,720 --> 01:48:05,763
Oh, my God.

1252
01:48:06,305 --> 01:48:07,473
Ok, Sir.

1253
01:48:11,060 --> 01:48:12,770
He's on his way.

1254
01:48:14,146 --> 01:48:16,398
Can we talk to the other?

1255
01:48:26,659 --> 01:48:29,703
Hey, what the hell is going on?
Why the cops?

1256
01:48:30,037 --> 01:48:32,164
Alright. Sorry, go back to bed.

1257
01:48:33,707 --> 01:48:35,793
Where's Cutshaw?

1258
01:48:36,836 --> 01:48:40,130
Krebs, look in the dorm, will you please?
Christian, go up -

1259
01:48:41,298 --> 01:48:43,050
Oh, my God.

1260
01:49:07,491 --> 01:49:09,034
He's dead.

1261
01:49:14,707 --> 01:49:17,042
He gave up his life.

1262
01:50:02,630 --> 01:50:03,839
Major?

1263
01:50:58,227 --> 01:51:03,107
If you die first and there's life after death...

1264
01:51:03,107 --> 01:51:06,402
Will you give me a sign?

1265
01:53:55,863 --> 01:53:57,781
Captain Cutshaw,

1266
01:53:58,199 --> 01:54:00,367
I'm taking my life...

1267
01:54:00,367 --> 01:54:04,580
...in the hope that my death will provide
the shock that is curative therapy.

1268
01:54:04,622 --> 01:54:08,417
In any case,
you now have your one example.

1269
01:54:09,168 --> 01:54:12,630
If ever I've injured you, I am sorry.

1270
01:54:13,005 --> 01:54:15,716
I have been fond of you.

1271
01:54:15,841 --> 01:54:19,261
I know some day I will see you again.

1272
01:54:19,428 --> 01:54:21,055
Vincent Kane.

1273
01:54:44,703 --> 01:54:47,915
Sure heard some stories about this place, sir.

1274
01:54:48,666 --> 01:54:52,670
Heard they had a doctor there
that was really a killer.

1275
01:55:00,302 --> 01:55:02,680
He was a lamb.

1276
01:55:13,774 --> 01:55:14,733
Ok.

1277
01:55:30,291 --> 01:55:33,002
Hey, hold it, hold it.

1278
01:55:35,296 --> 01:55:38,966
Where did the Saint Christopher medal come from?
