1
00:01:07,499 --> 00:01:12,473
Now, the E Street Band has come
thousands of miles tonight.

2
00:01:15,145 --> 00:01:17,682
And we're here for one reason.

3
00:01:19,152 --> 00:01:21,354
Because you're here.

4
00:01:26,164 --> 00:01:32,140
And where we want to go, we
can't get there by ourselves.

5
00:01:34,412 --> 00:01:39,420
Where we want to go, we can't
get there by ourselves.

6
00:01:40,522 --> 00:01:42,392
We need you.

7
00:01:45,464 --> 00:01:50,104
So I got one question
that I want to ask you.

8
00:01:50,106 --> 00:01:53,210
Can you feel the spirit?

9
00:01:57,785 --> 00:02:03,329
If you can feel the spirit, I want you
to answer me with a "Yeah, yeah!"

10
00:02:04,431 --> 00:02:07,267
Can you feel the spirit?

11
00:02:07,269 --> 00:02:12,108
Yeah! Yeah!

12
00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:15,281
Can you feel the spirit now?

13
00:02:15,283 --> 00:02:21,261
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

14
00:02:36,418 --> 00:02:42,395
My three words for Bruce Springsteen
are hope, heart and perspective.

15
00:02:42,397 --> 00:02:45,501
Intense, passionate
and earnest.

16
00:02:51,212 --> 00:02:53,180
Bruce is power.

17
00:02:53,182 --> 00:02:54,816
Bruce is belief.

18
00:02:54,818 --> 00:02:58,622
Bruce is togetherness.

19
00:02:58,624 --> 00:03:03,131
My first experience with Bruce
Springsteen was in here

20
00:03:03,133 --> 00:03:06,904
<i>in this venue, 1987, The
Tunnel Of Love Express Tour.</i>

21
00:03:06,906 --> 00:03:10,911
And my journey
started on that night.

22
00:03:10,913 --> 00:03:16,288
I was nine years old and I was
hanging in the fences up here

23
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:18,892
and having a blast
and, you know,

24
00:03:18,894 --> 00:03:22,364
there must have been 100 people
behind me who couldn't see the show.

25
00:03:22,366 --> 00:03:26,304
But I was a kid at the time,
so they probably thought,

26
00:03:26,306 --> 00:03:28,775
"Hey, let the boy
enjoy himself. "

27
00:03:28,777 --> 00:03:31,947
But I remember
I recorded the entire show,

28
00:03:31,949 --> 00:03:36,521
three and a half hours,
on an old Walkman,

29
00:03:36,523 --> 00:03:40,395
and on the old cassette tapes,
and I still have them at home.

30
00:03:40,397 --> 00:03:43,366
I keep them in a box and...

31
00:03:43,368 --> 00:03:46,840
Once every now and then,
I stumble on to this box

32
00:03:46,842 --> 00:03:51,614
and I look at it and I smile, you
know, because I actually remember.

33
00:03:51,616 --> 00:03:55,788
I remember the night. It was
a beautiful summer night.

34
00:03:55,790 --> 00:03:59,795
What these tapes represent
is basically why I keep them

35
00:03:59,797 --> 00:04:05,239
and they represent a great day
in a nine-year-old boy's life

36
00:04:05,241 --> 00:04:07,710
and that's priceless.

37
00:04:07,712 --> 00:04:09,980
My favorite singer
is Bruce Springsteen

38
00:04:09,982 --> 00:04:13,886
because I think

39
00:04:13,888 --> 00:04:17,959
he puts like when
he has a concert,

40
00:04:17,961 --> 00:04:23,003
he puts a lot of effort
into his singing.

41
00:04:23,005 --> 00:04:26,843
Like he takes a deep
breath before every song

42
00:04:26,845 --> 00:04:29,513
and like when the
camera goes close up,

43
00:04:29,515 --> 00:04:32,719
you can just see
his veins popping out

44
00:04:32,721 --> 00:04:36,325
because he's working so
hard and after one song

45
00:04:36,327 --> 00:04:39,298
he's as sweaty as
a normal singer would be

46
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:42,001
after he's done like 10 songs.

47
00:04:42,003 --> 00:04:44,774
These are some of
the pictures that I've...

48
00:04:44,776 --> 00:04:48,347
I won, or I bought
or framed them.

49
00:04:48,349 --> 00:04:51,919
But this particular one,
it's a little moldy.

50
00:04:51,921 --> 00:04:55,425
I used to hold this
picture up to my son

51
00:04:55,427 --> 00:04:58,397
and say, "Daddy, Daddy. "

52
00:04:58,399 --> 00:05:03,573
So I think maybe I played
some head games with my son

53
00:05:03,575 --> 00:05:07,679
for the first few years of his life
thinking that this was his daddy.

54
00:05:07,681 --> 00:05:09,682
A song about growing up.

55
00:05:14,926 --> 00:05:18,798
<i>♪ Well, I stood
stone-like at midnight</i>

56
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:22,372
<i>♪ Suspended in my masquerae</i>

57
00:05:22,374 --> 00:05:25,911
<i>♪ And I combed my hair
it looked just right</i>

58
00:05:25,913 --> 00:05:29,550
<i>♪ And commanded
the night brigade</i>

59
00:05:29,552 --> 00:05:33,592
<i>♪ I was open to pain
and crossed by the rain</i>

60
00:05:33,594 --> 00:05:36,930
<i>♪ And I walked on
my crooked crutch</i>

61
00:05:36,932 --> 00:05:40,669
<i>♪ I strolled all alone
through a fallout zone</i>

62
00:05:40,671 --> 00:05:44,510
<i>♪ And came out with
my soul untouched</i>

63
00:05:44,512 --> 00:05:47,883
<i>♪ I hid in the clouded
wrath of the crowd</i>

64
00:05:47,885 --> 00:05:51,021
<i>♪ When they said sit down
I stood up</i>

65
00:05:55,763 --> 00:05:57,999
<i>♪ Growing up</i>

66
00:06:02,141 --> 00:06:05,914
<i>♪ Well, the flag of piracy
blew from my mast</i>

67
00:06:05,916 --> 00:06:09,219
<i>♪ My sails were
set wing to wing</i>

68
00:06:09,221 --> 00:06:12,959
<i>♪ I had a jukebox graduate
for first mate</i>

69
00:06:12,961 --> 00:06:16,599
<i>♪ She couldn't sail
but she sure could sing</i>

70
00:06:16,601 --> 00:06:20,605
<i>♪ I pushed B-52 and bombed
them with the blues</i>

71
00:06:20,607 --> 00:06:24,046
<i>♪ With my gear set
stubborn on standing</i>

72
00:06:24,048 --> 00:06:27,685
<i>♪ I broke all the rules,
strafed my old high scho,</i>

73
00:06:27,687 --> 00:06:31,625
<i>♪ And never once
gave thought to landing</i>

74
00:06:31,627 --> 00:06:35,098
<i>♪ I hid in the clouded
wrath of the crowd</i>

75
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:38,637
<i>♪ But when they said come don
I threw up</i>

76
00:06:43,146 --> 00:06:45,549
<i>♪ Growing up</i>

77
00:07:13,131 --> 00:07:16,335
Hi. I'm Theresa Martin

78
00:07:16,337 --> 00:07:21,311
and this is what I've
collected over the years.

79
00:07:21,313 --> 00:07:27,156
I have an abundance
of love for Bruce.

80
00:07:28,258 --> 00:07:32,096
So, Theresa, when did you actually
become a Bruce Springsteen fan?

81
00:07:32,098 --> 00:07:35,869
I became a Bruce Springsteen
fan in 1982.

82
00:07:35,871 --> 00:07:40,711
Really? And do you recall how
many live shows you actually attended?

83
00:07:40,713 --> 00:07:44,884
I'm not sure. I'm in
double digits clearly.

84
00:07:45,754 --> 00:07:47,356
But I'd say 30 plus.

85
00:07:47,358 --> 00:07:50,293
30 plus, that's quite
an adventure you had.

86
00:07:50,295 --> 00:07:54,701
I also understand that you've won
a few Bruce Springsteen contests.

87
00:07:54,703 --> 00:07:58,875
Is that correct? That is correct.
I've won two.

88
00:07:58,878 --> 00:08:04,152
One being... The first
contest I won was...

89
00:08:07,692 --> 00:08:10,429
<i>Help me.
The Today Show.</i>

90
00:08:10,431 --> 00:08:13,100
That's one. And you know what?
I'm good.

91
00:08:13,102 --> 00:08:15,738
<i>Because you know what?
It was The Today Show.</i>

92
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:19,311
<i>It was in 2002 when
The Risifirst came out</i>

93
00:08:19,313 --> 00:08:23,886
and I gave birth
to my first son.

94
00:08:23,888 --> 00:08:27,058
And he was a month old.

95
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:31,065
And I actually was home

96
00:08:31,067 --> 00:08:34,170
<i>and The Today Show
had questions.</i>

97
00:08:34,172 --> 00:08:38,177
I answered them and I won and
we went to New York City.

98
00:08:38,179 --> 00:08:42,451
So I'd kind of like to
introduce my son Dominic.

99
00:08:44,254 --> 00:08:46,726
And this is my son now.

100
00:08:46,728 --> 00:08:50,298
He's 10 years old and...

101
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:55,372
Well, Dominic, you had a little
bit of a special moment, didn't you?

102
00:08:55,374 --> 00:08:57,443
What's the question?

103
00:08:57,445 --> 00:08:59,781
You had a bit of a special Bruce
Springsteen moment, didn't you?

104
00:08:59,783 --> 00:09:02,451
Yes, I did. And can you
explain that to us?

105
00:09:04,189 --> 00:09:05,959
I've got it.

106
00:09:08,798 --> 00:09:13,772
This is the picture
I got after the concert.

107
00:09:13,774 --> 00:09:15,475
We were waiting on the curb

108
00:09:15,476 --> 00:09:18,814
and a friend was going
to get the vehicle.

109
00:09:18,816 --> 00:09:24,793
And the police came and stopped all
the cars from where they were going.

110
00:09:25,895 --> 00:09:30,467
And a black SUV came.

111
00:09:30,469 --> 00:09:34,407
And in the back seat with his
window down was Bruce Springsteen.

112
00:09:34,409 --> 00:09:37,044
Everyone ran up to the car.

113
00:09:37,046 --> 00:09:40,251
She was told to back off by the
policeman standing next to her.

114
00:09:40,253 --> 00:09:45,395
And I shook his hand while
getting this close-up picture.

115
00:09:46,497 --> 00:09:50,034
Dominic,
where was that concert at?

116
00:09:50,036 --> 00:09:51,972
Fenway Park in Boston.

117
00:09:51,974 --> 00:09:54,475
Awesome. Awesome.

118
00:09:54,477 --> 00:09:58,115
So now you're the next generation
Bruce Springsteen fan.

119
00:09:58,117 --> 00:10:00,419
Yes, I am.
Excellent.

120
00:10:00,421 --> 00:10:02,422
What's your favorite
Bruce song?

121
00:10:02,424 --> 00:10:04,292
<i>Death To My Hometown.</i>

122
00:10:04,294 --> 00:10:05,560
Why?

123
00:10:05,562 --> 00:10:08,065
I like it.

124
00:10:08,067 --> 00:10:10,135
Which is good. However...

125
00:10:10,137 --> 00:10:12,406
Because of the words.

126
00:10:12,408 --> 00:10:16,079
Taught to me by
this person right here.

127
00:10:16,081 --> 00:10:18,651
And when Mommy tells you
to listen to the words,

128
00:10:18,653 --> 00:10:21,321
or understand the words,
what do you say?

129
00:10:21,323 --> 00:10:23,058
Okay.

130
00:10:24,228 --> 00:10:26,531
And do you hear the words?
Yes.

131
00:10:26,533 --> 00:10:28,935
Do you really hear the words?
Yes.

132
00:10:28,937 --> 00:10:30,672
Okay, I just want to make sure.

133
00:10:30,674 --> 00:10:32,942
Thank you, goodbye.

134
00:10:32,944 --> 00:10:36,214
Thank you, Dominic.
Yeah!

135
00:10:36,216 --> 00:10:38,351
So we got to the
park at four o'clock

136
00:10:38,353 --> 00:10:40,989
with our signs with us,
our home-made signs.

137
00:10:40,991 --> 00:10:42,659
<i>♪ You can't start a fire</i>

138
00:10:42,661 --> 00:10:45,096
I had my "I'll be your
Courtney Cox" sign.

139
00:10:45,098 --> 00:10:48,001
<i>♪ I'm stranded with
a broken heart</i>

140
00:10:48,003 --> 00:10:51,473
I had my Aviator sunglasses on.
It was pouring with rain.

141
00:10:51,475 --> 00:10:53,946
I had my
Courtney Cox T-shirt on.

142
00:10:53,948 --> 00:10:56,650
<i>♪ You can't start a fire</i>

143
00:10:56,651 --> 00:10:59,689
Then James said to me, "Rachel, come on.
Get on my shoulders. "

144
00:10:59,691 --> 00:11:01,992
And I was like,
"Oh, no, I don't want to. "

145
00:11:01,994 --> 00:11:04,997
I felt bad for the people behind us.
They wouldn't be able to see.

146
00:11:04,999 --> 00:11:08,070
He's like, "Come on. You never know
when we're going to see Bruce again. "

147
00:11:09,572 --> 00:11:11,742
Literally, a couple of
seconds into the song,

148
00:11:11,744 --> 00:11:13,712
Bruce spotted me
and started laughing

149
00:11:13,714 --> 00:11:16,351
and he was pointing at me
and I was waving at him.

150
00:11:16,353 --> 00:11:19,322
Next thing I know, I get put on
the big screen with my sign.

151
00:11:25,633 --> 00:11:29,172
The next thing I know, the girl in
front of me just turned around to me

152
00:11:29,174 --> 00:11:32,779
and screamed, "He wants you on the stage!
"He wants you on the stage!"

153
00:11:32,781 --> 00:11:35,550
<i>♪ Hey, baby!</i>

154
00:11:35,552 --> 00:11:39,624
The next thing I know, I'm just being
pushed through a sea of black bodies.

155
00:11:39,626 --> 00:11:44,232
I had my sunglasses on.
I couldn't see anything.

156
00:11:44,234 --> 00:11:47,739
The next thing I know I'm dancing
with Bruce Springsteen on stage.

157
00:12:20,161 --> 00:12:22,465
Before I knew it, it was all over.
That was it.

158
00:12:22,467 --> 00:12:25,103
We took a bow
and he gave me a big hug

159
00:12:25,105 --> 00:12:28,274
and the only thing I could say
to him was, "Bruce, I love you. "

160
00:12:30,345 --> 00:12:32,883
<i>♪ You can't start a fire</i>

172
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:16,925
<i>and it always
helps me feel bett.</i>

173
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:20,398
<i>A song by Bruce can
stop me dead in my tracks,</i>

174
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:24,572
<i>even a song I've heard over
and over again for 28 years.</i>

175
00:13:24,574 --> 00:13:27,311
<i>But Bruce
is timeless.</i>

176
00:13:27,313 --> 00:13:30,749
<i>He's helped me live in my own
time and become who I am.</i>

177
00:13:30,751 --> 00:13:34,690
<i>I've been a fan of
Springsteen's all my life.</i>

178
00:13:34,692 --> 00:13:39,396
<i>He was just standing in that
spotlight and he was so powerful</i>

179
00:13:39,398 --> 00:13:44,005
<i>and the whole crowd was just
mesmerised by what he could do</i>

180
00:13:44,007 --> 00:13:47,545
<i>and the stories that he could tell
and I just remember thinking,</i>

181
00:13:47,547 --> 00:13:53,391

185
00:14:09,486 --> 00:14:14,291
Hi. My name is Kitty.
I'm a truck driver.

186
00:14:14,293 --> 00:14:19,335
And Bruce Springsteen is my favorite
artist to listen to on the road.

187
00:14:20,437 --> 00:14:22,838
Recently I drove
through Arizona

188
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:27,714
<i>and I listened to
his album Nebraska</i>

189
00:14:27,716 --> 00:14:32,857
<i>and the song
Atlantic City came on.</i>

190
00:14:32,859 --> 00:14:38,066
And it just felt really good,
listening to that loud,

191
00:14:38,068 --> 00:14:40,504
while driving
through the desert.

192
00:14:42,942 --> 00:14:48,655
In fact, I think every
important moment of my life

193
00:14:50,857 --> 00:14:55,096
has a theme song
that's Bruce Springsteen.

194
00:14:55,098 --> 00:14:57,666
So all of these CDs in my car,

195
00:14:57,668 --> 00:15:01,539
absolutely every single one
is Bruce Springsteen.

196
00:15:01,541 --> 00:15:06,548
Wait, actually one is his wife
Patti, my favorite album from Patti.

197
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:08,618
But that's all
we listen to in this car,

198
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:11,057
so my three sons,
they have no choice.

199
00:15:11,059 --> 00:15:13,093
I only listen to Bruce

200
00:15:13,095 --> 00:15:17,601
and they are schooled in the
music of Bruce Springsteen

201
00:15:17,603 --> 00:15:19,537
when they drive
around with Mommy

202
00:15:19,539 --> 00:15:22,075
and I have to take them
all over God's creation.

203
00:15:22,077 --> 00:15:26,817
They know they don't have a choice.
It's no Disney bop nonsense music.

204
00:15:26,819 --> 00:15:29,422
It's Bruce Springsteen.

205
00:15:29,424 --> 00:15:31,926
And I love it, because
it gives me such joy.

206
00:15:31,928 --> 00:15:36,534
I'm so proud of them when they can
sing songs that are 30 years old

207
00:15:36,536 --> 00:15:40,941
from when I was little.

Bruce... Bruce's sound
and E Street Band

217
00:16:17,807 --> 00:16:21,777
sounded completely different than
anything else I'd ever heard.

218
00:16:21,779 --> 00:16:25,852
With Clarence in there
and the keyboard layers

219
00:16:25,854 --> 00:16:30,928
and the heavier drumming.

220
00:16:30,930 --> 00:16:33,533
It's like a punchy
soul band or something.

00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:35,537
Sexy sax.

222
00:16:35,539 --> 00:16:39,977
Hence began my love
for rhythm and blues

223
00:16:39,979 --> 00:16:43,683
and sex music,
I guess, soul music.

224
00:16:43,685 --> 00:16:45,753
Bruce's lyrics...

225
00:16:50,696 --> 00:16:53,901
...always made me feel...

226
00:16:56,573 --> 00:17:02,016
...like I was going through
someone's family photo album

227
00:17:03,118 --> 00:17:05,253
and looking at their life

228
00:17:06,223 --> 00:17:09,728
and feeling what they felt

229
00:17:10,897 --> 00:17:15,872
and smelling their coffee

230
00:17:15,874 --> 00:17:21,583
and feeling their sadness

231
00:17:23,887 --> 00:17:27,793

So, David, what does
Bruce Springsteen mean to you?

245
00:20:19,957 --> 00:20:25,132
Bruce Springsteen means love,

246
00:20:25,134 --> 00:20:29,240
not for him, but for you.

247
00:20:29,242 --> 00:20:33,314
You being a fan, I've had
Bruce Springsteen songs

248
00:20:33,316 --> 00:20:37,387
rammed down my throat 24/7.

249
00:20:37,389 --> 00:20:41,594
It tends to lose its edge.
It really does.

250
00:20:43,098 --> 00:20:45,234
I've been all over Europe.

251
00:20:45,236 --> 00:20:49,140
So how many concerts
have you been to?

252
00:20:49,142 --> 00:20:52,012
You... I think you reminded me.
It was about eight.

253
00:20:52,014 --> 00:20:55,518
Eight that
I've actually been to.

254
00:20:55,520 --> 00:21:01,197
Yeah, Amsterdam, Paris, I mean,
I've seen some beautiful cities

255
00:21:02,299 --> 00:21:06,471
along the way, but then I've
always had this little bit

256
00:21:06,473 --> 00:21:10,478
where I've had to go to a
concert in the middle of it,

257
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:14,051
which tends to spoil it for me.

258
00:21:14,053 --> 00:21:17,456
And his dream was to get
on stage with Springsteen.

259
00:21:17,458 --> 00:21:20,428
I heard him talking about
it from the time we met

260
00:21:20,430 --> 00:21:22,531
until it actually happened.

261
00:21:22,533 --> 00:21:25,570
That's my lifelong dream. And I said,
"You're really going to do it?"

262
00:21:25,572 --> 00:21:28,208
And he goes. "I'm going to do
it. " I said, "Do you promise?"

263
00:21:28,210 --> 00:21:30,178
And he said, "I promise. "

264
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:34,118
So he puts a suit on. He's dragging
me across the street to get there

265
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:37,358
and as soon as he got up there,
people are going, "Hey, Elvis. "

266
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:40,530
And they're high fiving him and
they're wanting their picture taken

267
00:21:40,532 --> 00:21:43,368
and they're asking him to sing
songs and he just kind of...

268
00:21:43,370 --> 00:21:45,672
All the anxiety
just melted away.

269
00:21:45,674 --> 00:21:48,710
We had a sign that said... Can
the King sing with the Boss?

270
00:21:48,712 --> 00:21:50,614
Can the King
sing with the Boss?

271
00:21:50,616 --> 00:21:52,818

<i>♪ Hey, hey, hey</i>

278
00:22:13,288 --> 00:22:17,394
All of a sudden he stopped singing
and the band kept playing

279
00:22:17,396 --> 00:22:20,165
and he said,
"Okay, King, come on up. "

280
00:22:20,167 --> 00:22:24,772
And it was like, "Oh, my God, I
can't believe it's happening. "

281
00:22:24,774 --> 00:22:28,279
It was like
my dream of 20 years.

282
00:22:28,281 --> 00:22:32,486
And there I was and I'm
being helped up on stage.

283
00:22:32,488 --> 00:22:34,422
Come on, King!

284
00:22:46,444 --> 00:22:48,714
When I saw him
being pulled up on stage,

285
00:22:48,716 --> 00:22:51,519
everybody around me is like,
"Hey, he's up there. "

286
00:22:51,521 --> 00:22:54,257
Because they all were sharing
the experience with me.

287
00:22:54,259 --> 00:22:58,264
It was surreal. It was like, "Oh,
my gosh, I'm married to Elvis"

288
00:22:58,266 --> 00:23:01,302
"and he's singing with Springsteen
and his dream's realized. "

289
00:23:01,304 --> 00:23:03,407

I was so excited.

296
00:23:25,714 --> 00:23:27,948
Right when he was about
to start singing,

297
00:23:27,950 --> 00:23:32,522
his son texted me and said, "Did
my dad get on stage? Ha-ha!"

298
00:23:32,524 --> 00:23:34,961
And I went,
"He's up there now. "

299

302
00:23:43,544 --> 00:23:45,647
I said, "He's singing

303
00:23:45,649 --> 00:23:47,383
"He's singing

304
00:23:47,385 --> 00:23:49,954
He had the faith
and he handed me the mic

305
00:23:49,956 --> 00:23:53,493
and I said,
"Okay, this is it. "

306
00:23:53,495 --> 00:23:56,865
So I did my best
and as I was singing,

307
00:23:56,867 --> 00:24:00,306
at one point,
I dropped to my knees...

308

Take it, Bruce!

312
00:24:17,337 --> 00:24:20,406
And I kick out my leg, which
when you look at the video,

313
00:24:20,408 --> 00:24:22,943
it looks like an Elvis move,
but the fact of the matter is

314
00:24:22,945 --> 00:24:25,414
when I dropped to my knees,
I pulled my hamstring.

315
00:24:25,416 --> 00:24:28,988
I immediately kicked out my leg,
because I'd pulled my hamstring

316
00:24:28,990 --> 00:24:32,394
and then I stood up and my
leg was hurting a little bit

317
00:24:32,396 --> 00:24:35,466
and at that point that's
when I said, "Hit it, Bruce. "

318
00:24:35,468 --> 00:24:36,901
And he did his guitar solo.

319
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,871
And then I realized
that during the guitar solo

320
00:24:57,873 --> 00:25:00,642
<i>that there is no guitar
solo in All Shook Up</i>

321
00:25:00,644 --> 00:25:03,614
and didn't quite know
what to do at that moment

322
00:25:03,616 --> 00:25:06,419
and I turned around
and looked at Max

323
00:25:06,421 --> 00:25:10,560
and I backed up, thinking that I'm
going to have to change the song.

324
00:25:10,562 --> 00:25:14,734
And out of no disrespect to Bruce
or the band, but I backed up

325
00:25:14,736 --> 00:25:18,707
and looked at Max and right at
the end of the guitar solo,

326
00:25:18,709 --> 00:25:22,981
<i>I went into Blue Suede Shoes and
the band was right there with me.</i>

329
00:25:30,463 --> 00:25:33,500
And I remember in the corner of
my eye, I see Bruce coming up

330
00:25:33,502 --> 00:25:35,970
and I remember, as I'm
singing, saying to myself,

331
00:25:35,972 --> 00:25:39,910
"Uh-oh, I think you're done, Nick,"
because just by looking at Bruce

332
00:25:39,912 --> 00:25:43,584
and I said, "Okay, Bruce, take
it home. " And he grabs the mic.

333
00:25:43,586 --> 00:25:45,654
Take it home, Bruce!

334
00:25:45,656 --> 00:25:48,492
Elvis has left the building!

335
00:25:50,696 --> 00:25:52,999
Elvis has left the building!

336
00:25:55,973 --> 00:25:57,941
Thank you, King.

337
00:25:57,943 --> 00:26:01,615
And then I remember
jumping off the stage and...

338
00:26:01,617 --> 00:26:05,554
He got totally mobbed by the crowd
because they were all so excited.

339
00:26:05,556 --> 00:26:08,828
Everybody wanted to hug him and,
you know, like high five him

340
00:26:08,830 --> 00:26:12,834
and I'm just waiting, because I
just can't wait to like hug him

341
00:26:12,836 --> 00:26:16,006
and kiss him and say, "Oh, my
God, we've realized your dream. "

342
00:26:16,008 --> 00:26:18,075
And it was like a scene from...

343
00:26:18,077 --> 00:26:21,982
<i>Wasn't it like a scene from Rocky and
Adrian were yelling for each other</i>

344
00:26:21,984 --> 00:26:24,922
just to try to catch up to
each other so we can embrace?

345
00:26:24,924 --> 00:26:27,192
And once we did,
it was like the most...

346
00:26:27,194 --> 00:26:30,631
I don't know. The tears fill your
eyes, because you're so happy.

347
00:26:39,315 --> 00:26:43,988
And as we turn around, we look up and
Bruce was holding that last note.

348
00:26:52,370 --> 00:26:55,341
He pointed to us
and he kept saying,

349
00:26:55,344 --> 00:26:58,280
"The Philly Elvis.
The Philly Elvis. "

350
00:26:59,115 --> 00:27:01,385
The Philly Elvis!

351
00:27:02,788 --> 00:27:05,324
The Philly Elvis!

352
00:27:05,326 --> 00:27:10,368
Then the last thing he said, which I'll
never forget. He looks and says...

353
00:27:10,370 --> 00:27:14,341
I have no idea where the
he came from.

354
00:27:15,877 --> 00:27:17,947
Thank you, King.

355
00:27:21,921 --> 00:27:25,292
He means inspiration.
He means joy.

356
00:27:25,294 --> 00:27:29,133
And he means salt of the earth.

357
00:27:29,135 --> 00:27:32,739
I know it's three words,
of the three words

358
00:27:32,741 --> 00:27:35,009
but I don't want to alter
salt of the earth.

359
00:27:35,011 --> 00:27:38,114
He's just the best.
He's the best.

360
00:27:38,116 --> 00:27:41,954
Happy, handsome and hot.

361
00:27:41,956 --> 00:27:47,731
Supernatural,
divine, inspiration.

362
00:27:47,733 --> 00:27:49,233
My soul brother.

363
00:27:49,235 --> 00:27:53,275
A local legend.

364
00:27:53,277 --> 00:27:58,349
In three words, I would
say, in him we trust.

365
00:27:58,351 --> 00:28:01,088
Am I looking okay? Okay.

366
00:28:01,090 --> 00:28:03,859
Passion, passion, passion.

367
00:28:05,329 --> 00:28:09,435
It was March 29th, 1976,

368
00:28:09,437 --> 00:28:12,274
right smack in the
middle of the '70s.

369
00:28:12,276 --> 00:28:15,413
And it seemed like
all our parents were gone.

370
00:28:15,415 --> 00:28:18,518
Just working,

371
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:21,188
busy, drunk
at the country club.

372
00:28:21,190 --> 00:28:25,463
So somehow it was okay
for a group of girls

373
00:28:25,465 --> 00:28:31,407
to go to see a rock 'n' roll
concert on a Monday night

374
00:28:31,409 --> 00:28:33,778
in March of our 9th grade year.

375
00:28:33,780 --> 00:28:37,518
I don't remember what happened
when we got to the concert.

376
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:40,156
I don't know what happened
to the other girls,

377
00:28:40,158 --> 00:28:42,426
but I know that
as soon as I got there,

378
00:28:42,428 --> 00:28:44,395
as soon as the lights went out,

379
00:28:44,397 --> 00:28:47,434
I made my way
to the front of the stage,

380
00:28:47,436 --> 00:28:49,505
back when you could do that.

381
00:28:51,876 --> 00:28:57,853
And was front and center up against
the stage right in front of Bruce.

382
00:28:57,855 --> 00:29:01,158
Even after all these years and
all the shows that I've seen,

383
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:04,531
the concert still
defies description.

384
00:29:04,533 --> 00:29:10,009
And I think that only the people
who saw him in the early days

385
00:29:11,111 --> 00:29:16,986
in the small venues,
before the mega crowds...

386
00:29:16,988 --> 00:29:21,327
And when you could get so close
that you were sharing the sweat

387
00:29:21,329 --> 00:29:25,367
and spit of whatever band
member you were closest to,

388
00:29:25,369 --> 00:29:30,945
can really know the ferocity and
intimacy of those concerts.

425
00:31:59,335 --> 00:32:02,506
After graduation, I
couldn't really get a job

426
00:32:02,508 --> 00:32:08,415
and so I started
working at Jamba Juice

427
00:32:08,417 --> 00:32:11,420
making oatmeal
in the early morning.

428
00:32:11,422 --> 00:32:13,725
I'd have to get up
at three o'clock.

429
00:32:13,727 --> 00:32:18,333
I didn't have a car,
so I rode my bike to work

430
00:32:18,335 --> 00:32:21,940
<i>and that was when
Working on a Dreacame out.</i>

431
00:32:21,942 --> 00:32:25,879
I would listen to that on my
way to work and feel like,

432
00:32:25,881 --> 00:32:30,720
"Oh, I'm such
a hard-working person. "

433
00:32:32,459 --> 00:32:36,363
"I'm the backbone of
America. " That's what...

434
00:32:36,365 --> 00:32:42,273
Well, sometimes I feel like that
when I listen to Bruce like,

435
00:32:42,275 --> 00:32:47,352
you know, like I'm really
important, the work I do, the...

436
00:32:51,792 --> 00:32:55,297
The more physically
demanding my job is,

437
00:32:55,299 --> 00:32:57,934
the more important I am,
when I listen to Bruce.

438
00:32:57,936 --> 00:33:03,277
I don't know if that makes any
sense, but that's how I feel.

439
00:33:03,279 --> 00:33:07,351
<i>Madison Square Garden,
2000, the Reunion Tour.</i>

440
00:33:08,621 --> 00:33:10,422
I'd worked in
a factory for 20 years

441
00:33:10,424 --> 00:33:13,729
and I'd saved up
enough money eventually

442
00:33:13,731 --> 00:33:17,735
to afford to go on a Bruce
trip as we call it,

443
00:33:17,737 --> 00:33:22,377
four days in New York, two
concerts at Madison Square Garden.

444
00:33:22,379 --> 00:33:27,620
So me and my lovely wife Kath
stayed in the Hotel Pennsylvania,

445
00:33:27,621 --> 00:33:31,326
across the road from
Madison Square Garden.

446
00:33:31,328 --> 00:33:33,930
We went down to the bar
to pick up our tickets

447
00:33:33,932 --> 00:33:38,305
on the night of the
concert, the first concert,

448
00:33:40,375 --> 00:33:42,913
and excitedly opened the
envelope, looked at the tickets,

449
00:33:42,915 --> 00:33:46,585
looked at the map seating plan

450
00:33:46,587 --> 00:33:50,559
and we were right at the
back, right at the top.

451
00:33:50,561 --> 00:33:53,698
So a bit disappointed,
but we were in New York,

452
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:56,569
America for the first time.

453
00:33:56,571 --> 00:34:01,011
So looked at the positives,
we went across the road,

454
00:34:01,013 --> 00:34:04,516
up the escalators right to
the top, right to the back,

455
00:34:04,518 --> 00:34:06,687
and as we got to the top level,

456
00:34:06,689 --> 00:34:12,564
this rather bear-like character
in baggy shorts and a beard,

457
00:34:12,566 --> 00:34:16,136
as he walked past me,
muttered the immortal words,

458
00:34:17,139 --> 00:34:19,743
"You want to be upgraded?"

459
00:34:19,745 --> 00:34:23,383
Sorry? Didn't know what he meant?
Didn't quite hear him.

460
00:34:23,385 --> 00:34:26,654
"Let me see your tickets," he said,
so I showed him our tickets.

461
00:34:26,656 --> 00:34:28,592
He looked at them and said,

462
00:34:28,594 --> 00:34:30,996
"I think we can do better than that.
Give me your wrist. "

463
00:34:30,998 --> 00:34:34,502
I put my wrist out and he
slapped an orange wristband

464
00:34:34,504 --> 00:34:37,940
on my wrist and Kath's and
I said, "What's that for?"

465
00:34:37,942 --> 00:34:41,414
He said, "Don't remove that from your wrist.
Don't leave the building. "

466
00:34:41,416 --> 00:34:44,486
"If you leave the building,
you won't be allowed back in. "

467
00:34:44,488 --> 00:34:47,024
And like he'd
said it 1,000 times.

468
00:34:47,026 --> 00:34:48,993
He put our tickets
in his pockets

469
00:34:48,995 --> 00:34:52,200
and then he peeled off a couple
of tickets, gave them to us

470
00:34:52,202 --> 00:34:54,035
and said something like,

471
00:34:54,037 --> 00:34:57,040
"I work for Bruce. I don't
want any money from you. "

472
00:34:57,042 --> 00:35:01,114
"I don't want any recognition. Please
don't point me out to other people. "

473
00:35:01,116 --> 00:35:03,718
"Thank you for your support.
Enjoy the show. "

474
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:05,789
And he was gone.

475
00:35:05,791 --> 00:35:10,898
So we're looking at the tickets,
entrance whatever it was.

476
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:13,001
We thought, "We'd better
find this entrance, then. "

477
00:35:13,003 --> 00:35:16,640
So we walked round Madison
Square Garden at the top

478
00:35:16,642 --> 00:35:19,712
and there was no entrance
and I thought,

479
00:35:19,714 --> 00:35:22,918
"I've just given my tickets
to a complete stranger"

480
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:26,692
"and we've got tickets that
don't get us in anywhere. "

481
00:35:26,694 --> 00:35:30,765
Kath, my wife, pointed out that
we'd just gone past a cocktail bar,

482
00:35:30,767 --> 00:35:35,740
like they do in America, not a
beer stand like in England.

483
00:35:35,742 --> 00:35:38,945
And she said, "There's a couple in
there with orange wristbands on. "

484
00:35:38,947 --> 00:35:41,585
"Let's go and ask them. "
We went to the cocktail bar.

485
00:35:41,587 --> 00:35:44,054
Sure enough, very elegant
couple sitting there,

486
00:35:44,056 --> 00:35:46,827
and we said, "Excuse me".
And we told them our story.

487
00:35:46,829 --> 00:35:48,864
He said,
"Let me see your tickets. "

488
00:35:48,866 --> 00:35:51,134
He looked at the
tickets and he goes,

489
00:35:51,136 --> 00:35:54,171
"You got the best seats in the house.
What's your problem?"

490
00:35:54,173 --> 00:35:57,711
I still found it
a bit hard to believe.

491
00:35:57,713 --> 00:36:01,118
But sure enough we went to
a staff member, showed him

492
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:04,724
and he just pointed us down
through that entrance

493
00:36:04,726 --> 00:36:09,332
and then the next level down,
keep going, keep going.

494
00:36:09,334 --> 00:36:12,071
We got to the back
of the front section

495
00:36:12,073 --> 00:36:14,174
with the maroon rope
across and thought,

496
00:36:14,176 --> 00:36:17,980
"Oh, we must be behind here somewhere.
This is fantastic. "

497
00:36:17,982 --> 00:36:21,018
We showed the man.
He unclipped the rope.

498
00:36:21,020 --> 00:36:23,356
"Down to the front, sir. "

499
00:36:23,358 --> 00:36:28,265
And we ended up on the front
row at Madison Square Garden

500
00:36:28,267 --> 00:36:31,170
to see Bruce Springsteen
and the E Street Band

501
00:36:31,172 --> 00:36:34,109
in the year 2000.

502
00:36:34,111 --> 00:36:37,681
I got so excited
I bought my wife

503
00:36:37,683 --> 00:36:41,622
three glasses of champagne
at seven dollars a glass.

504
00:36:41,624 --> 00:36:44,258
And I was a factory
worker at the time.

505
00:36:44,260 --> 00:36:47,898
And it was phenomenal.

506
00:36:47,900 --> 00:36:51,338
So that's what it's like to
be a Bruce Springsteen fan.

507
00:36:51,340 --> 00:36:56,283
<i>♪ Early in the morning
factory whistle blows</i>

508
00:36:57,385 --> 00:37:03,191
<i>♪ Man rises from bed
and puts on his clothes</i>

509
00:37:03,193 --> 00:37:08,869

510
00:37:08,871 --> 00:37:14,112
<i>♪ It's the working, the
working, just the working life</i>

511
00:37:15,214 --> 00:37:18,052
<i>♪ Through the mansions of fear</i>

512
00:37:18,054 --> 00:37:21,056
<i>♪ Through the mansions of pain</i>

513
00:37:21,058 --> 00:37:26,900
<i>♪ I see my daddy walking through
them factory gates in the rain</i>

514
00:37:26,902 --> 00:37:32,844
<i>♪ Factory takes his hear,

515
00:37:32,846 --> 00:37:38,286
<i>♪ The working, the worki,

516
00:38:02,161 --> 00:38:07,105
<i>♪ End of the day,

517
00:38:08,207 --> 00:38:13,847

518
00:38:13,849 --> 00:38:16,919

519
00:38:16,921 --> 00:38:19,957

521
00:38:26,004 --> 00:38:31,345
<i>♪ It's the working, the working,
just the working life ♪</i>

522
00:39:12,918 --> 00:39:18,158
Here we are just hanging out in the
evening at home in our living room,

523
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:21,030
talking about Bruce Springsteen,
like we do every night.

524
00:39:21,032 --> 00:39:24,336
Yes, we do.
Okay.

525
00:39:24,338 --> 00:39:29,611
Anyway, this is my vintage shirt.
Remember this one?

526
00:39:29,613 --> 00:39:33,551
I hardly ever wear it, because
I have to preserve it.

527
00:39:33,553 --> 00:39:37,292
And I never even went to a show.
How did you get that shirt?

528
00:39:37,294 --> 00:39:39,029
I never even went to a show.

529
00:39:39,031 --> 00:39:42,100
We'd never been able to get
tickets when we had money

530
00:39:42,102 --> 00:39:45,038
and then we didn't have
money, so we couldn't go.

531
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:48,611
Unfortunately not, but we're
still huge Bruce fans.

532
00:39:48,613 --> 00:39:51,015
Oh, God, honey.
What? We are.

533
00:39:51,017 --> 00:39:53,018
I know we are.
All right, so?

534
00:39:55,425 --> 00:39:59,464
Anyway, yes, this was my ex-boyfriend
who I was living with in Manhattan

535
00:39:59,466 --> 00:40:04,908
and he was a musician and I was
a writer-actress-waitress.

536
00:40:06,010 --> 00:40:10,616
And I think he went to the show,
but I was already seeing you.

537
00:40:10,618 --> 00:40:13,455
Then he was trying to woo me
back with the Bruce shirt.

538
00:40:13,457 --> 00:40:16,125
And it didn't quite work.
And I won.

539
00:40:16,127 --> 00:40:19,430
He might have been able to woo me
back if he'd bought Bruce with him.

540
00:40:21,103 --> 00:40:24,406
Anyway, yeah, so it's
my favorite shirt.

541
00:40:24,408 --> 00:40:27,312
I don't wear it too often.
I don't want to wear it out.

542
00:40:27,314 --> 00:40:29,615
Right, but for this occasion...

543
00:40:29,618 --> 00:40:31,452
But it's funny because we
were talking the other night.

544
00:40:31,454 --> 00:40:33,856
We were saying about how...

545
00:40:36,294 --> 00:40:41,538
You know, we were talking about like
how Bruce is kind of in our lives

546
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:45,376
and stuff like that and...

547
00:40:45,378 --> 00:40:49,083
And we were talking about
like the fact that we're...

548
00:40:49,085 --> 00:40:52,321
It sounds so stupid, but we
are kind of like the people

549
00:40:52,323 --> 00:40:55,126
that are in his songs
in different ways.

550
00:40:55,128 --> 00:40:58,131
Very much so, blue collar.
Blue collar.

551
00:40:58,133 --> 00:41:00,403
Together 28 years.
Struggling.

552
00:41:00,405 --> 00:41:02,506
Yeah, struggling with the kids

553
00:41:02,508 --> 00:41:06,212
and you go to work
every day in Manhattan

554
00:41:06,214 --> 00:41:10,386
and works with his hands and has
been doing that for over 30 years.

555
00:41:10,388 --> 00:41:14,193
But we're still together.
That's the main thing.

556
00:41:14,195 --> 00:41:18,333
But if you say it one more
time, we might not be.

557
00:41:18,335 --> 00:41:22,307
<i>So I've got these tickets to see
Bruce with my girlfriend in Hamilton</i>

558
00:41:22,309 --> 00:41:26,815
<i>and she calls me on October 20th,
the night before the concert,</i>

559
00:41:26,817 --> 00:41:31,857
<i>while I'm at work and just
tells me, "It's over. "</i>

560
00:41:31,859 --> 00:41:35,763
<i>And I think, "This is going to
be the worst day of my life. "</i>

561
00:41:35,765 --> 00:41:40,739
<i>So I get home, I get drinking and
I don't know what else to do,</i>

562
00:41:40,741 --> 00:41:44,745
<i>or what to think except I
guess I need somebody else</i>

563
00:41:44,747 --> 00:41:47,518
<i>to go see
Bruce Springsteen with me.</i>

564
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:51,624
<i>And I guess that
won't be too hard to find.</i>

565
00:41:51,626 --> 00:41:57,370
<i>And then I think, "I've got
tickets on the floor. "</i>

566
00:41:58,472 --> 00:42:04,282
<i>And I realized, "No, no, no,
what I need is a sign. "</i>

567
00:42:28,389 --> 00:42:32,428
<i>Hi, Bruce,
I just got dumped.</i>

568
00:42:32,430 --> 00:42:34,731
We all know what that's like.

569
00:42:36,637 --> 00:42:38,439
Where's my man, right there?

570
00:42:40,811 --> 00:42:44,350
What happened, bro?

571
00:42:44,352 --> 00:42:47,320
She didn't think I was
spending enough time with her.

572
00:42:48,958 --> 00:42:50,759
You probably weren't.

573
00:42:57,672 --> 00:42:59,708
Can you get a hug?

574
00:42:59,710 --> 00:43:01,544
Come on up here.

575
00:43:05,519 --> 00:43:07,489
It's going to be okay.

576
00:43:07,491 --> 00:43:09,760
It's going to be all right.

577
00:43:09,762 --> 00:43:11,462
Don't worry about a thing.

578
00:43:23,884 --> 00:43:25,887
I got dumped
plenty of times myself.

579
00:43:25,889 --> 00:43:28,893
Oh, they're regretting it now.

580
00:43:28,895 --> 00:43:31,830
That's right.
She'll be regretting it.

581
00:43:35,938 --> 00:43:41,014
That's right. They left too
soon, man, too soon they quit.

582
00:43:44,586 --> 00:43:46,657
Aha!

583
00:43:46,659 --> 00:43:50,030
And missed that record company
advance money, they left too soon.

584
00:43:57,610 --> 00:44:01,516
<i>♪ We sit in the car

604
00:45:12,039 --> 00:45:15,110
All right, my three words are

605
00:45:15,112 --> 00:45:17,112
poet,

606
00:45:17,781 --> 00:45:20,051
comfort,

607
00:45:20,053 --> 00:45:23,892
and gluteus maximostus.

608
00:45:23,894 --> 00:45:28,065
Hope, insurance and redemption.

609
00:45:31,840 --> 00:45:35,779
Working-class hero.

610
00:45:35,781 --> 00:45:39,317
And I think that in general Polish
people could relate to his music,

611
00:45:39,319 --> 00:45:43,559
especially during communism, because
he was singing about freedom.

612
00:45:43,561 --> 00:45:46,898
When you... At the time people
couldn't speak English so well,

613
00:45:46,900 --> 00:45:50,837
<i>so when like in the song
Born in the USA,</i>

614
00:45:50,839 --> 00:45:54,678
they could understand
only the chorus,

615
00:45:54,680 --> 00:45:57,283
so everybody was thinking that,

616
00:45:57,285 --> 00:46:01,723
"Oh, he's praising the fact that
he's an American. It's so great"

617
00:46:01,725 --> 00:46:06,064
<i>I guess that if you hear him singing
Born in the USA with such charisma,</i>

618
00:46:06,066 --> 00:46:08,903
you want to be like that.
I want to be an American, too.

619
00:46:08,905 --> 00:46:12,909
So those were like the sounds of
freedom, I would say, really.

620
00:46:12,911 --> 00:46:16,082
<i>♪ Born down in
a dead man's town</i>

621
00:46:16,084 --> 00:46:20,055
<i>♪ The first kick I took

622
00:46:20,057 --> 00:46:23,662
<i>♪ You end up like a dog

623
00:46:23,664 --> 00:46:28,803

00:46:28,805 --> 00:46:31,808

<i>♪ I was born in the USA</i>

00:46:35,751 --> 00:46:40,758
<i>♪ I was born in the USA</i>

627
00:46:40,760 --> 00:46:44,697
<i>♪ Born in the USA</i>

628
00:46:44,699 --> 00:46:48,437
<i>♪ Got in a little hometown jam</i>

629
00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:52,444
<i>♪ So they put a rifle

630
00:46:52,446 --> 00:46:56,084
<i>♪ Sent me off to a foreign land</i>

631
00:46:56,086 --> 00:47:00,358
<i>♪ To go and kill the yellow man</i>

632
00:47:00,360 --> 00:47:03,329
<i>♪ Born in the USA</i>

633
00:47:03,331 --> 00:47:07,437
<i>♪ I was born in the USA</i>

634
00:47:07,439 --> 00:47:11,410
<i>♪ I was born in the USA</i>

635
00:47:11,412 --> 00:47:16,051
<i>♪ I was born in the USA</i>

636
00:47:16,053 --> 00:47:18,756
And a special moment
for me was when

637
00:47:18,758 --> 00:47:23,164
<i>Bruce decided to go on the Reunion
Tour with the E Street Band</i>

638
00:47:23,166 --> 00:47:27,104
just around the millennium and the
boys, they hit Copenhagen as well.

639
00:47:27,106 --> 00:47:32,748
And I was here. It was one
of those nights to remember.

640
00:47:32,750 --> 00:47:37,323
I remember during
the encore of the show,

641
00:47:37,325 --> 00:47:39,960
<i>Bruce decides to
play Blood Brothers,</i>

642
00:47:39,962 --> 00:47:43,032
beautiful song, beautiful song.

643
00:47:43,034 --> 00:47:47,173
And during the
last verse of the song,

644
00:47:47,175 --> 00:47:51,179
the guy next to me...
I don't know his name.

645
00:47:51,181 --> 00:47:55,086
I'd never seen him before.
I haven't seen him since.

646
00:47:55,088 --> 00:47:57,557
He decides to
put his arm around me.

647
00:47:57,559 --> 00:48:02,098
You know, all of a sudden, this
big guy has his arm around me.

648
00:48:02,100 --> 00:48:06,105
And it was just one of those moments
where it didn't seem weird at all.

649
00:48:11,917 --> 00:48:14,954
<i>♪ On through the
houses of the dead</i>

650
00:48:16,490 --> 00:48:19,829
<i>♪ Past those fallen
in their tracks</i>

00:48:21,300 --> 00:48:24,938

00:48:26,408 --> 00:48:29,847
<i>♪ And never looking back</i>

653
00:48:45,241 --> 00:48:46,942
Let's sing.

00:49:03,672 --> 00:49:06,643
<i>♪ Now we're out e on this road</i>

655
00:49:08,280 --> 00:49:12,220
<i>♪ All along this road tonight</i>

<i>♪ Close my eyes and feel

00:50:04,176 --> 00:50:07,081
I remember walking home
after the show with my girl

667
00:50:07,083 --> 00:50:11,522
and she said to me, "At some point, I
felt like I was the only one there. "

668
00:50:11,524 --> 00:50:14,227
"I felt like he
was playing for me. "

669
00:50:14,229 --> 00:50:19,668
And I said, "I know. I know exactly
what you're talking about. I know. "

670
00:50:28,553 --> 00:50:32,726
Hello. My name is Jane.

671
00:50:32,728 --> 00:50:38,036
I'm living in Helsingor, in
Denmark, just a small town.

672
00:50:39,138 --> 00:50:42,408
This is the first time I've
ever tried to make a video

673
00:50:42,410 --> 00:50:45,815
from my camera,
so this is not very good.

674
00:50:45,818 --> 00:50:51,257
However, I wish to say
something about me and Bruce.

675
00:50:51,259 --> 00:50:55,298
We have been friends
ever since 1985,

676
00:50:55,300 --> 00:50:59,872
though he do not know me.

677
00:50:59,874 --> 00:51:05,482
I have listened to his music
every day since '85.

678
00:51:05,484 --> 00:51:08,121
I know the lyrics.
I know the music.

679
00:51:08,123 --> 00:51:13,197
Every day when I go home for work,
I hear his records in my car.

680
00:51:14,299 --> 00:51:16,535
I sort of relax.

681
00:51:16,537 --> 00:51:21,710
I sort of get in a very good
mood when I listen to Bruce.

682
00:51:21,712 --> 00:51:26,919
It doesn't matter whether it is
the new music or the old music.

683
00:51:26,921 --> 00:51:30,258
I just love listening
to his music.

684
00:51:30,260 --> 00:51:33,931
I'm not the kind of fan who
knows the size of his shoes,

685
00:51:33,933 --> 00:51:37,671
or the names of his children,
although I know he has three children

686
00:51:37,673 --> 00:51:41,912
and he has a lovely wife Patti.

687
00:51:41,914 --> 00:51:46,887
Which is also...
She has a wonderful vocal.

688
00:51:46,889 --> 00:51:51,595
And, of course, I understand
why he loves his woman.

689
00:51:51,597 --> 00:51:57,506
One of the best music I have
heard him sing is the...

690
00:51:57,508 --> 00:51:59,441
<i>Red Headed Woman.</i>

691
00:51:59,443 --> 00:52:04,584
It is the kind of song that a man
who really loves his woman has made

692
00:52:04,586 --> 00:52:10,560
and it must be wonderful to be
Patti to receive such a song.

693
00:52:13,802 --> 00:52:17,374
I don't know what to say. I'm the
kind of fan who has attended

694
00:52:17,376 --> 00:52:21,981
all his concerts
since '85 here in Denmark.

695
00:52:21,983 --> 00:52:27,257
I always stand in the first
row, screaming and shouting

696
00:52:27,259 --> 00:52:30,830
and dancing like a teenager
to a Beatles' concert.

697
00:52:32,700 --> 00:52:34,936
This summer I was that lucky

698
00:52:34,939 --> 00:52:40,012
that finally, after all
these years, I touched him.

699
00:52:40,014 --> 00:52:44,654
We touched each other twice
in Roskilde in Denmark

700
00:52:44,656 --> 00:52:49,730
and I cried like... I wept
because it was so big.

701
00:52:50,832 --> 00:52:54,671
It's a great song about a great
subject, cunnilingus. That's right.

702
00:52:54,673 --> 00:52:59,647
Yeah. I hope I'm pronouncing
that correctly.

703
00:53:00,749 --> 00:53:05,991
Yeah, as I like to say, if you can
pronounce it, you can probably do it.

704
00:53:05,993 --> 00:53:07,694
That's right.

705
00:53:09,097 --> 00:53:14,672
And what can I say about it?
It's a college town.

706
00:53:14,674 --> 00:53:17,377
There's probably people
practicing cunnilingus out there

707
00:53:17,379 --> 00:53:19,980
as we speak tonight.

708
00:53:19,982 --> 00:53:23,887
I hope so
and I do mean practicing,

709
00:53:23,889 --> 00:53:26,660
because you young
whipper-snappers,

710
00:53:26,662 --> 00:53:29,631
it takes a while to get that
under your belt.

711
00:53:31,435 --> 00:53:35,041
It's like balancing a plate
on the end of your nose.

712
00:53:35,043 --> 00:53:37,111
It's not as easy as it looks.

713
00:53:40,685 --> 00:53:45,826
It takes some dedication,
it takes discipline,

714
00:53:45,828 --> 00:53:48,798
attention to craft and detail.

715
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:52,003
That's right.
It takes... Yes.

716
00:53:54,408 --> 00:53:59,182
It takes patience, patience
and more patience.

717
00:54:02,656 --> 00:54:04,726
As I usually say.

718
00:54:05,561 --> 00:54:08,765
But anyway

719
00:54:08,767 --> 00:54:11,603
to not get into the whole
Freudian complications

720
00:54:11,605 --> 00:54:14,008
of moving from one song
into the other.

721
00:54:16,615 --> 00:54:19,184
We'll just leave
that alone, right?

722
00:54:22,590 --> 00:54:25,194
Whoo! What can I say?
Where was I?

723
00:54:33,643 --> 00:54:36,013
Oh, if there are
any kids out there,

724
00:54:36,015 --> 00:54:40,086
cunnilingus is Latin for "It's
nice to keep your room very neat. "

737
00:55:32,746 --> 00:55:36,050
I hadn't been to a ton
of rock 'n' roll yet,

738
00:55:36,052 --> 00:55:39,590
but I'd seen my share of shows.

739
00:55:39,592 --> 00:55:42,695
And I understood in some way
that what I was witnessing

740
00:55:42,697 --> 00:55:48,139
was something far beyond me
and my world as I knew it.

741
00:55:49,241 --> 00:55:54,951
I was way too in the moment to
know that my life was changing,

742
00:55:56,053 --> 00:56:01,994
but I did know that with each song,
I was leaving something behind.

743
00:56:03,765 --> 00:56:06,837
The really critical
departure happened during

744
00:56:06,839 --> 00:56:12,748
<i>the long soul-shaking
instrumental in Jungleland.</i>

745
00:56:12,750 --> 00:56:17,721
He turned his back to us and
he walked towards the drum.

746
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:25,337
He swayed and he danced to the sax,
the bass, the organ, the piano.

747
00:56:26,439 --> 00:56:32,084
He was young and taut
and all that man and men

748
00:56:34,286 --> 00:56:39,226
and song and sound
became something bigger

749
00:56:40,328 --> 00:56:45,737
and more powerful than anything
I understood or knew yet

750
00:56:45,739 --> 00:56:49,210
in my young body.

751
00:56:49,212 --> 00:56:52,348
And it was something
about rock 'n' roll and sex

752
00:56:52,350 --> 00:56:56,989
and men and music and myself

753
00:56:56,991 --> 00:57:02,334
and I grew a few years
and a few inches

754
00:57:03,436 --> 00:57:09,179
when that incredibly beautiful
man had his perfect body

755
00:57:10,281 --> 00:57:15,325
moving perfectly to
that crazy, sexy, sad song.

756
00:57:17,527 --> 00:57:22,433
Everyone was totally
transfixed, tranced out.

757
00:57:22,435 --> 00:57:27,542
I don't know if
anybody else was there,

758
00:57:27,544 --> 00:57:30,380
but it was like the genie had
been let out of the bottle

759
00:57:30,382 --> 00:57:32,952
and for me there
was no going back.

760
00:57:35,357 --> 00:57:39,163
I think I cried.
I must have.

761
00:57:39,165 --> 00:57:41,967
I was ripped out of my skin.

762
00:57:41,969 --> 00:57:44,405
I was ripped out of my senses.

763
00:57:44,407 --> 00:57:50,081
It was like the thunderbird had
swooped and had me in its talons.

764
00:57:50,083 --> 00:57:55,224
And then someone behind me
lifts me up onto the stage,

765
00:57:55,226 --> 00:57:58,196
really gently,
just lifts me up,

766
00:57:58,198 --> 00:58:01,535
and I stand up and I'm standing
right there next to him.

767
00:58:01,537 --> 00:58:06,210
And I'm so close I can see
the sweat through his jeans

768
00:58:06,212 --> 00:58:10,049
and his dirty Converse.

769
00:58:10,051 --> 00:58:13,355
And I look at him and he's
looking at me and he smiles

770
00:58:13,357 --> 00:58:15,359
and I sort of moved to the side

771
00:58:15,361 --> 00:58:18,029
and the next thing
I know someone comes

772
00:58:18,031 --> 00:58:23,541
and really gently lowers me back
down to where I was before.

773
00:58:24,643 --> 00:58:29,383
And I look around and there are
men all around me smiling.

774
00:58:30,286 --> 00:58:33,156
I'm soaked to the skin

775
00:58:33,158 --> 00:58:35,426

He's a very

792
00:59:49,790 --> 00:59:55,432
He tells me that it's okay
to be what you want to be.

793
00:59:55,434 --> 00:59:59,739

what he is to me, you know?

797
01:00:15,234 --> 01:00:17,537
He is rock 'n' roll.
He is country.

798
01:00:17,539 --> 01:00:19,506
He is a sex symbol.

01:00:19,508 --> 01:00:21,711

01:01:51,735 --> 01:01:56,774
I think that relationships
have been brought together

823
01:01:56,776 --> 01:02:00,815
and then folded before you've
actually finished your concert.

824
01:02:00,817 --> 01:02:02,885
It's just too long.

825
01:02:02,887 --> 01:02:07,793
For the people who are there
for their loved ones,

826
01:02:07,795 --> 01:02:09,931
it's quite a long
period of time.

827
01:02:09,933 --> 01:02:13,738
I'm thinking. "What time
does the last train leave?"

828
01:02:13,740 --> 01:02:18,712
"You know, how can I make this
picnic that I've brought last?"

829
01:02:18,714 --> 01:02:22,619
You know, it's things like
that that really matter to me.

830
01:02:33,639 --> 01:02:36,076
<i>The night before this
happened, I was so broke</i>

831
01:02:36,078 --> 01:02:38,713
<i>that I had to sleep
in a public park.</i>

832
01:02:38,715 --> 01:02:42,421
<i>And then 12 hours late, I'm standing
with my guitar from the street,</i>

833
01:02:42,423 --> 01:02:46,026
getting ready to play some cafes and
this guy comes up to me and says,

834
01:02:46,028 --> 01:02:48,899
"Hey, Bruce is coming
down the street. "

835
01:02:48,901 --> 01:02:52,739
And I said, "Oh, yeah. "
Just another hero for me.

836
01:02:52,741 --> 01:02:55,644
Didn't really believe it, but
then I looked across the street

837
01:02:55,646 --> 01:02:59,350
and I see Bruce out there and
this tall black man with him

838
01:02:59,352 --> 01:03:04,458
and that was Clarence Clemons
and I said, "Well... "

839
01:03:04,460 --> 01:03:08,365
I shouted out, "Hey, Bruce, why don't
you come and play us the real thing?"

840
01:03:08,367 --> 01:03:12,004
He kind of looked at me and
thought it was just funny

841
01:03:12,006 --> 01:03:14,477
and then I said again,
"Hey, come on. "

842
01:03:14,479 --> 01:03:17,548
And then he made a U-turn.
He came across the street.

843
01:03:17,550 --> 01:03:21,020
And that's where this picture
started happening here.

844
01:03:21,022 --> 01:03:23,725
I handed him one of the guitars

845
01:03:23,727 --> 01:03:27,030
<i>and he starts here
on the song I'm on Fire.</i>

846
01:03:27,032 --> 01:03:29,535
<i>♪ Hey little girl
is your daddy home</i>

847
01:03:29,537 --> 01:03:34,009
<i>♪ Did he go and
leave you all alone</i>

848
01:03:34,011 --> 01:03:36,748
<i>♪ I got a bad desire</i>

849
01:03:37,985 --> 01:03:42,023
<i>♪ Oh-oh-oh, I'm on fire</i>

850
01:03:42,025 --> 01:03:46,197
<i>And I said, "Hey, I got to
do something for my family. "</i>

851
01:03:46,199 --> 01:03:49,503
<i>I saw there was a video
camera across, you know,</i>

852
01:03:49,505 --> 01:03:52,208
<i>so I came behind him.</i>

853
01:03:54,479 --> 01:03:59,119
<i>♪ Oh-oh-oh, I'm on fire</i>

854
01:03:59,121 --> 01:04:03,694
I was kind of nervous about
what he would feel about it,

855
01:04:03,696 --> 01:04:08,804
but I kind of said, "Well,
hey, he should be cool enough",

856
01:04:09,906 --> 01:04:13,145
"you know, and this is the street.
We're all kings on the street. "

857
01:04:13,147 --> 01:04:15,388
"There's nobody
above another there. "

858
01:04:26,702 --> 01:04:29,638
<i>And it's kind of hard to
believe ths was all happening.</i>

859
01:04:29,640 --> 01:04:32,944
<i>There was a crowd in front,
you know, and...</i>

860
01:04:34,582 --> 01:04:36,684
You never can tell
what happens in life.

861
01:04:36,686 --> 01:04:39,690
You never can tell.
It was amazing.

862
01:04:40,893 --> 01:04:42,828
What do you know?

863
01:04:53,681 --> 01:04:58,322
We got on with it for I think it
was 15 minutes and 17 seconds.

864
01:04:58,324 --> 01:05:04,132
So, they say every man has 15
minutes of fame in his life.

865
01:05:04,134 --> 01:05:07,637
I went a bit overboard.

866
01:05:07,639 --> 01:05:12,045
<i>♪ Even if we're just
dancing in the dark</i>

867
01:05:15,586 --> 01:05:19,593
<i>♪ Even if we're just
dancing in the dark ♪</i>

868
01:05:22,932 --> 01:05:26,304
<i>I didn't really realize
what had happened.</i>

869
01:05:26,306 --> 01:05:30,011
<i>It was kind of...
It was kind of too qui.</i>

870
01:05:38,727 --> 01:05:43,901
<i>Then the day after I was on the
front pe singing with Bruce.</i>

871
01:05:46,006 --> 01:05:50,712
<i>This is a great thg
that such a big man</i>

872
01:05:50,714 --> 01:05:54,853
<i>would come and step down
and give, you know...</i>

873
01:05:54,855 --> 01:05:58,993
He wasn't... He was just
one of us, you know.

874
01:05:58,995 --> 01:06:02,967
Okay, he had had success, but
he was still just one of us

875
01:06:02,969 --> 01:06:06,840
and that's what I really
loved about it, you know.

876
01:06:06,842 --> 01:06:09,177
I really loved that.

877
01:06:11,283 --> 01:06:15,723
<i>We just said goodbye to one another
and he went his way and I went mine.</i>

878
01:06:15,725 --> 01:06:19,830
<i>It was exactly how it should
happen on the street, you know.</i>

879
01:06:27,143 --> 01:06:30,114
Hi, my name is Gillian.

880
01:06:30,116 --> 01:06:32,852
Hi, my name's Gillian.

881
01:06:32,854 --> 01:06:34,889
Hi, my name's Gillian

882
01:06:34,891 --> 01:06:37,160
and I'm a pretty big...
I'm a...

883
01:06:37,162 --> 01:06:41,500
Hi, my name's Gillian and I'm a
pretty big Bruce Springsteen fan.

884
01:06:41,502 --> 01:06:44,906
After my first
Bruce brought... Hi.

885
01:06:44,908 --> 01:06:46,977
No.

886
01:06:46,979 --> 01:06:48,813
No.

887
01:06:52,086 --> 01:06:57,061
Hi. My name's Gillian and I'm a
pretty big Bruce Springsteen fan.

888
01:06:57,063 --> 01:07:00,032
After my first
Bruce concert in April,

889
01:07:00,034 --> 01:07:03,304
I was so excited
and so full of emotion

890
01:07:03,306 --> 01:07:07,780
and I wanted to let Bruce know
how important he was to me,

891
01:07:07,782 --> 01:07:11,118
so I wrote him a letter, thinking
I'd be able to send it to him,

892
01:07:11,120 --> 01:07:15,794
but I couldn't find
a fan mail address.

893
01:07:15,796 --> 01:07:19,065
So I wrote it anyway
and just put it out there

894
01:07:19,067 --> 01:07:22,538
in case I'd ever have the chance
to tell him how important he is

895
01:07:22,540 --> 01:07:25,177
and his music is in my life.

896
01:07:25,179 --> 01:07:28,014
So this is the perfect
opportunity for that,

897
01:07:28,016 --> 01:07:30,852
so I'm going to share
that letter now.

898
01:07:30,854 --> 01:07:33,825
<i>Dear Bruce, to say
I am a fan of yours</i>

899
01:07:33,827 --> 01:07:36,396
<i>would be quite
an understatement.</i>

900
01:07:36,398 --> 01:07:39,234
<i>Your music is woven
into my very being.</i>

901
01:07:39,236 --> 01:07:42,238
<i>It has become a part
of the story of me,</i>

902
01:07:42,240 --> 01:07:46,981
<i>turning into a kind of soundtrack of
the past couple of years of my life.</i>

903
01:07:46,983 --> 01:07:50,018
<i>I first discovered your
music about four years ago.</i>

904
01:07:50,020 --> 01:07:53,291
<i>I heard Glory Days on the radio
and I guess it spoke to me</i>

905
01:07:53,293 --> 01:07:56,030
<i>and to where I was
at that point in my life.</i>

906
01:07:56,032 --> 01:07:58,133
<i>I started looking
at more of your songs</i>

907
01:07:58,135 --> 01:08:01,171
<i>and my parents were quite amused
that I was suddenly listening</i>

908
01:08:01,173 --> 01:08:04,377
<i>to music from their time.</i>

909
01:08:04,379 --> 01:08:09,486
<i>But that's the thing, Bruce, your
music doesn't have a time or a place.</i>

910
01:08:09,488 --> 01:08:13,559
<i>Your music is a story and it
bends and flows into the stories</i>

911
01:08:13,561 --> 01:08:16,097
<i>of everyone who listens to it.</i>

912
01:08:16,099 --> 01:08:20,170
<i>I guess what I'm trying
to say is thank you.</i>

913
01:08:20,172 --> 01:08:22,542
<i>It seems like every time
I hit a bump in life,</i>

914
01:08:22,544 --> 01:08:25,446
<i>I turn to you
and to your songs.</i>

915
01:08:25,448 --> 01:08:28,585
<i>They pick me up and dust me
off in a way that no one</i>

916
01:08:28,588 --> 01:08:31,524
<i>and nothing else can.</i>

917
01:08:31,526 --> 01:08:34,229
<i>We all go through
dark times in life</i>

918
01:08:34,231 --> 01:08:37,200
<i>and sometimes things
aren't going to get better</i>

919
01:08:37,202 --> 01:08:39,604
<i>and they're not going
to be all right.</i>

920
01:08:39,606 --> 01:08:43,444
<i>In those times, music can
be the best companion,</i>

921
01:08:43,446 --> 01:08:47,351
<i>because it reminds you there can
still be beauty in this world</i>

922
01:08:47,353 --> 01:08:51,359
<i>and that all is not lost
in spite of it all.</i>

923
01:08:51,361 --> 01:08:56,634
<i>Without you, I would be lost.
Thank you.</i>

924
01:08:56,636 --> 01:08:58,737
Thank you.
Thank you.

925
01:08:58,739 --> 01:09:00,507
Thanks, Bruce.
Thank you.

We love you.

the bottom of my heart.

Thank you, Bruce. Thank you
for your amazing music.

943
01:09:37,273 --> 01:09:38,774
I just want to say thanks.

Thanks, Bruce.

945
01:09:40,346 --> 01:09:41,578
Thank you, Bruce.

946
01:09:41,580 --> 01:09:43,248
Thank you so much.

947
01:09:43,250 --> 01:09:44,383
