1
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:19,813
After 5 or 6 years in the entertainment industry
I imposed some rules

2
00:01:19,896 --> 00:01:23,025
And one of them is: When am signing contract with a new artist

3
00:01:23,108 --> 00:01:27,195
- I have to sit down, take off my glasses,

4
00:01:27,279 --> 00:01:30,907
- Look him in the eye and say:

5
00:01:30,991 --> 00:01:37,372
"You have to listen seriously
This is not a joke."

6
00:01:37,456 --> 00:01:41,668
"If I do my job perfectly,
probably going to kill you".

7
00:01:52,554 --> 00:01:57,017
Shep Gordon has been my manager for 43 years.

8
00:01:57,100 --> 00:02:02,606
If you had not met Shep,
had ended after two or three years.

9
00:02:02,689 --> 00:02:07,527
I trusted Shep, absolutely.
He has the Midas touch.

10
00:02:07,736 --> 00:02:13,283
Shep is the best manager par excellence.
He has been a precursor. And everyone has followed.

11
00:02:13,367 --> 00:02:19,289
Shep Gordon's like Brian Epstein, Marshall McLuhan
and Mr. Magoo had had a son.

12
00:02:19,373 --> 00:02:24,628
I brag all the time about it.
Not only for their successes, which are many-

13
00:02:24,711 --> 00:02:28,548
- But it also is the most honest man I ever met.

14
00:02:28,632 --> 00:02:32,386
Could talk to him forever.

15
00:02:32,469 --> 00:02:39,393
Shep can be compassionate.
It can also be a bastard.

16
00:02:41,978 --> 00:02:44,981
Have the charisma of Elvis

17
00:02:45,065 --> 00:02:49,152
- physicist Steve Reeves,
wit Mark Twain

18
00:02:49,236 --> 00:02:52,906
- And you probably are as well equipped as
Long Dong Silver.

19
00:02:52,989 --> 00:03:00,372
Early on, Shep was like a professional bachelor.
With women in their door while leaving others behind.

20
00:03:00,455 --> 00:03:04,793
Met Shep in the 80s, in Hollywood.
Do not know if you remember Carlos & Charlies...

21
00:03:04,876 --> 00:03:09,172
Hypothetically, not me, say you were pulling cocaine
bathroom-

22
00:03:09,256 --> 00:03:13,760
- And then you threw away in the middle of a fight

23
00:03:13,844 --> 00:03:19,057
Shep was who you had to resort to
to reenter. Purely hypothetical.

24
00:03:19,391 --> 00:03:22,936
Shep and I have smoked marijuana for years
.

25
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:26,314
We are the canaries in the mine...

26
00:03:26,398 --> 00:03:29,484
As a young man working my way in the industry

27
00:03:29,568 --> 00:03:33,947
- They told me about the show that Shep had developed with Teddy
Pendergrass--

28
00:03:34,031 --> 00:03:38,201
- And how they managed to make way for black artists
breaking the "circuit Chitlin '"

29
00:03:38,285 --> 00:03:43,790
If someone asked me,
who invented the chef-celebrity

30
00:03:43,874 --> 00:03:48,003
- Undoubtedly, Shep Gordon.

31
00:03:48,086 --> 00:03:51,590
A "jubu" is a Jew who is also a Buddhist.

32
00:03:51,673 --> 00:03:55,677
And the Dalai Lama
plays an important role in his life.

33
00:03:55,761 --> 00:04:00,349
When Shep gets angry, which makes
is go and cook for the Dalai Lama.

34
00:04:00,432 --> 00:04:03,477
Am spiritual, I am Aries with an upward penis.

35
00:04:03,852 --> 00:04:07,814
I've met most famous
through Shep Gordon

36
00:04:07,898 --> 00:04:10,484
- That all my friends together.

37
00:04:10,567 --> 00:04:16,990
Before working with Shep, I did Ronnie Wood of the Rolling Stones
.

38
00:04:17,074 --> 00:04:21,453
The first thing he said was:
"Can you get access to Shep Gordon?"

39
00:04:21,912 --> 00:04:26,083
Everyone knows Shep.

40
00:04:26,166 --> 00:04:31,838
If walls could talk, Sheps
home in Maui will never be silent.

41
00:04:32,214 --> 00:04:35,258
Things correctly ago, most of the time.

42
00:04:35,342 --> 00:04:38,387
Sometimes libido controls.

43
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:43,934
He does not think necessarily head...

44
00:04:44,017 --> 00:04:47,521
... but in a different part.

45
00:05:13,755 --> 00:05:16,675
Good game, Mulligan.

46
00:05:16,758 --> 00:05:21,847
We've had - away - the legendary relationship.

47
00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:24,808
We have never had a contract.

48
00:05:24,891 --> 00:05:32,107
Think we've never taken the business as seriously as our friendship
.

49
00:05:33,442 --> 00:05:39,197
's Like a good marriage

50
00:05:39,281 --> 00:05:44,369
- They would do anything to protect. They love.
- Shep and I are family.

51
00:05:44,453 --> 00:05:50,876
If something would have happened, my wife and I,
he would have taken our children. And happy.

52
00:05:50,959 --> 00:05:56,173
Family is important. It is where you come from, your story.
It's part of who you are.

53
00:05:56,256 --> 00:05:59,843
The women in his life
have been incredibly beautiful.

54
00:05:59,926 --> 00:06:04,973
- I've always wanted a son.
- As you age...

55
00:06:05,057 --> 00:06:08,852
... I hope that things are equated.
- I love the smell of a baby.

56
00:06:08,935 --> 00:06:14,858
- Do not say you have to get a dog.
- It's the last chance to have my family.

57
00:06:14,941 --> 00:06:18,070
I'd like to see a good lady

58
00:06:18,153 --> 00:06:22,699
- That would give him as much as others

59
00:06:22,783 --> 00:06:26,870
I will be a few years yet,
to stay quiet.

60
00:06:26,953 --> 00:06:31,083
Deebemos remember that this is a man who used to wear a
-

61
00:06:31,166 --> 00:06:36,505
- shirt that read "No
blowjob, no backstage pass."

62
00:06:36,588 --> 00:06:41,551
Must be from that base.

63
00:06:42,928 --> 00:06:47,307
I graduated from the University of Buffalo.
Were the best days of my life

64
00:06:47,391 --> 00:06:55,023
I was an idealist and social-liberal.
I wanted to save the world.

65
00:06:55,107 --> 00:07:00,696
There were few jobs for sociologists,
and wanted to save some prisoners adolescents.

66
00:07:00,779 --> 00:07:04,866
You can not do anything to help
these petty criminals?

67
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:09,830
In 1968 I auditioned for the Prison Service
Parole in California.

68
00:07:09,913 --> 00:07:17,170
I left on my white horse to
Jail under Godparents, an hour from LA

69
00:07:17,254 --> 00:07:22,926
Had longish hair at the time,
and the other guards hated hippies.

70
00:07:23,009 --> 00:07:26,972
They sent me to play softball with the guys
.

71
00:07:27,055 --> 00:07:33,520
The guards laughed. It just came to me and started beating

72
00:07:33,603 --> 00:07:36,314
I was the ball.

73
00:07:36,398 --> 00:07:40,777
Understood that nobody wanted me there,
so I left.

74
00:07:40,861 --> 00:07:45,198
Drove to Los Angeles,
and found a vacant motel.

75
00:07:45,282 --> 00:07:50,829
It was a two story motel with pool.
I learned later that it was the "Landmark" of Hollywood.

76
00:07:50,912 --> 00:07:55,876
I checked, I took some acid.

77
00:07:55,959 --> 00:07:59,504
Was what we all did at that time.

78
00:07:59,588 --> 00:08:04,634
There it was, flown like a kite,
loving the world...

79
00:08:04,718 --> 00:08:08,638
... When I heard as if
trying to rape a girl in the pool.

80
00:08:08,722 --> 00:08:14,269
Ran to separate them, and the girl went crazy
and hit me.

81
00:08:14,353 --> 00:08:17,314
Were about to have sex, not fighting.

82
00:08:17,397 --> 00:08:22,361
Had been in Los Angeles only
24 hours and already I had beaten twice.

83
00:08:26,239 --> 00:08:30,410
When lowered in the morning,
heard again the voice of the girl.

84
00:08:30,494 --> 00:08:35,082
She asked me if I was the guy who had hit
yesterday. It was Janis Joplin.

85
00:08:35,165 --> 00:08:39,669
I was introduced to
guy who was sitting next to her. It was Jimi Hendrix.

86
00:08:39,753 --> 00:08:43,882
Jimi Hendrix  said: "You Jewish?" - Yes
"Then you should be manager.".

87
00:08:43,965 --> 00:08:48,136
"Whose No problem.?"
"Alice Cooper."

88
00:08:49,763 --> 00:08:53,600
Went to Landmark, we opened the door of his room

89
00:08:53,684 --> 00:08:59,106
was impossible to see through the smoke,
and cigarette was not precisely.

90
00:08:59,189 --> 00:09:02,150
When I could disperse the smoke

91
00:09:02,234 --> 00:09:08,657
- I saw Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin, Jim Morrison
with Shep on the couch.

92
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:16,289
The big names in the industry
taxiing with this guy.

93
00:09:16,373 --> 00:09:20,377
They entered,
and went to the bedroom

94
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:23,755
- I had a lot of
grass in a drawer.

95
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:28,844
I gave them a lot of grass, and they said:
"You will be our manager."

96
00:09:30,846 --> 00:09:35,600
The motel, Hollywood Landmark,
was where Janis died later.

97
00:09:35,684 --> 00:09:41,648
Was popular among musicians, but those were different times
was not a business.

98
00:09:41,732 --> 00:09:45,068
Era people struggling to survive
doing what they liked

99
00:09:45,152 --> 00:09:48,530
legends were not then.

100
00:09:48,613 --> 00:09:52,242
It was a great group of friends, and we
become a kind of family.

101
00:09:54,494 --> 00:09:58,248
When I started as manager, Alice had to play at a club called Cheetah
.

102
00:09:58,331 --> 00:10:01,626
The Doors headed the cartel,
so there were many people.

103
00:10:01,710 --> 00:10:05,505
Alice was drunk and yelling at people.

104
00:10:05,589 --> 00:10:09,885
Shouted "Nobody likes me"
which is one of their songs.

105
00:10:15,599 --> 00:10:18,310
It was horrible.

106
00:10:21,229 --> 00:10:23,607
"You stink, Alice Cooper!"

107
00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:28,111
He shouted: "Go home!"
They did. It was empty.

108
00:10:28,195 --> 00:10:34,284
Was a sabotage to the Doors, but I did not care.
No it was taking me seriously.

109
00:10:34,368 --> 00:10:37,579
I was selling drugs to people in the motel.

110
00:10:37,662 --> 00:10:44,044
I had to pretend I was manager if the police
wondered where he got the money.

111
00:10:44,127 --> 00:10:50,926
Jimi told me one day I had a group room
28. "Have cards?"

112
00:10:51,009 --> 00:10:54,346
"Cards?"
"You should have business cards".

113
00:10:54,429 --> 00:11:01,144
"? As the company proposed something lamara Jimi V and
appear the sign of peace, it would be cool".

114
00:11:01,228 --> 00:11:06,149
Went down to reception grabbed a dictionary.

115
00:11:06,233 --> 00:11:10,153
The first word
V we found was "Alive".

116
00:11:11,530 --> 00:11:16,410
My new clients were Pink Floyd.
I was his manager for nine days.

117
00:11:17,786 --> 00:11:24,334
I was really overwhelmed.
I was 22 and was manager of Alice.

118
00:11:24,418 --> 00:11:28,714
Thought I had achieved,
when Alice played the Fillmore.

119
00:11:28,797 --> 00:11:34,428
Bill Graham was the promoter
and marked the trend in the country.

120
00:11:34,511 --> 00:11:37,681
A Alice touched
telonear for Ike and Tina Turner.

121
00:11:37,764 --> 00:11:41,476
Assumed that Alice Cooper was an American folk
.

122
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:46,690
Did nothing to change his mind.

123
00:11:46,773 --> 00:11:50,569
Alice suddenly appeared with a
jacket made of dead rats.

124
00:11:50,652 --> 00:11:57,576
Bill sent his goons to get Alice
stage and evicted us.

125
00:11:57,659 --> 00:12:00,996
This star introduced the use of mascara for men, big deal.

126
00:12:02,289 --> 00:12:07,961
Many were arrested for possession
at the motel, so I had to stop.

127
00:12:08,045 --> 00:12:12,841
I asked Alice
would have to take seriously his career.

128
00:12:12,924 --> 00:12:16,219
We made a pact to stay together
to become millionaires.

129
00:12:16,303 --> 00:12:19,598
Never doubted Shep.

130
00:12:19,681 --> 00:12:25,228
I just knew we would
navigate through turbulence.

131
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:32,027
Started to get other gigs
but not enough. We had to do something radical.

132
00:12:32,110 --> 00:12:36,156
Part of the charm of the bands that were
at the level aspired -

133
00:12:36,239 --> 00:12:39,493
- was the fact that parents hated them.

134
00:12:39,576 --> 00:12:43,663
Knew that if parents hated us,
the kids would love it.

135
00:12:43,747 --> 00:12:49,836
I came up the ridiculousness of buying clothes
clear plastic.

136
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:55,384
Alice clunky
naked and then called for the police to arrest him

137
00:12:55,467 --> 00:13:01,890
- That would give media coverage,
to get parents hate us

138
00:13:01,973 --> 00:13:06,853
They boarded the stage completely naked,
and the public was completely shocked.

139
00:13:06,937 --> 00:13:10,982
Then called the police and told them that
had taken my son to this concert

140
00:13:11,066 --> 00:13:15,112
- In the band was naked.

141
00:13:15,195 --> 00:13:22,994
When police arrived, clothing was already tarnished
, by heat. Nothing was visible.

142
00:13:23,078 --> 00:13:28,083
The police looked and went again.

143
00:13:28,166 --> 00:13:33,630
Finally, we did not make that goal
arrested.

144
00:13:33,714 --> 00:13:38,343
- It was time to leave town.
- We were starving at that time.

145
00:13:38,427 --> 00:13:42,764
Alice was born in Detroit, so we could count
is that relatives would feed us

146
00:13:42,848 --> 00:13:46,977
We went to Detroit and played in several clubs
along the way.

147
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:51,356
All it can not happen to a band
happened to us.

148
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:55,861
Never had money, so we paid the motel
checks.

149
00:13:55,944 --> 00:14:00,115
We wrote bad checks and we were going cambiabando
hotel side.

150
00:14:00,198 --> 00:14:04,244
The Hotel called police,
and fled through the windows.

151
00:14:04,327 --> 00:14:07,998
We got into the car and drove
to the next town.

152
00:14:08,081 --> 00:14:11,293
Alleged that we had stolen towels.

153
00:14:11,376 --> 00:14:15,797
However, this is nonsense,
never swam.

154
00:14:15,881 --> 00:14:19,051
When we make money,
Shep turned and paid all the bills ..

155
00:14:19,134 --> 00:14:25,974
"I wrote a check without coverage
Let me get it right.." That's it.

156
00:14:27,851 --> 00:14:33,190
MC5 is an abbreviation for
Motor City 5. Son of Detroit.

157
00:14:36,026 --> 00:14:41,782
Went to the music scene in Detroit,
were the MC5 and The Stooges.

158
00:14:41,865 --> 00:14:45,619
In Shep develop my character to Alice.

159
00:14:45,702 --> 00:14:50,707
Said: "We have to invent something
no one has seen before."

160
00:14:54,669 --> 00:14:58,757
I had a teacher who said "You can achieve a great cultural impact
one of three things:

161
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:04,763
- Violence, sex or rebellion" Alice would
of the three.

162
00:15:04,846 --> 00:15:08,642
Shep had much to do in what would be
image and sound of Alice Cooper.

163
00:15:08,725 --> 00:15:12,437
Loved  We make a show on stage.

164
00:15:12,521 --> 00:15:15,857
The theatrical part was what distinguished us from other bands
.

165
00:15:15,941 --> 00:15:21,029
Alice is the vaudeville.
The idea was that people stand up and applaud

166
00:15:21,113 --> 00:15:26,660
so is that we put a
dollar bills into a sword, Alice tended to the public.

167
00:15:26,743 --> 00:15:29,913
If the first row stood
to grab them, everyone would do a jump.

168
00:15:29,996 --> 00:15:33,208
It had nothing to do with the song you were playing
-

169
00:15:33,291 --> 00:15:38,463
- but made everyone would stop,
shout and just have fun.

170
00:15:38,547 --> 00:15:42,926
Needed an end, and we had feather pillows
at the hotel.

171
00:15:43,009 --> 00:15:48,765
- So we stole.
- Filled the scene of feathers

172
00:15:48,849 --> 00:15:53,311
was fantastic and did not cost us anything.

173
00:15:53,395 --> 00:15:57,733
Knew how to put on a good show,
but did not know how to sell it.

174
00:15:57,816 --> 00:16:00,986
People have a certain image of
who is important.

175
00:16:01,069 --> 00:16:08,118
If you see someone being photographed
on the street, they get curious, wondering who will

176
00:16:08,201 --> 00:16:13,832
photographers often hired without
film cameras... just firing flashes

177
00:16:13,915 --> 00:16:17,002
Because that's the expectation what is "Be a Star"

178
00:16:17,085 --> 00:16:24,134
Even when we were starving, Shep
convinced us that we were a star.

179
00:16:24,217 --> 00:16:28,722
"If they have to get drunk every night, because it is
what makes a star, then do it."

180
00:16:28,805 --> 00:16:32,642
If you want to reach a wider audience

181
00:16:32,726 --> 00:16:39,483
The most effective medium is television, so we did things
bothering people.

182
00:16:39,566 --> 00:16:42,486
"Detroit Tubeworks" strikes again

183
00:16:42,569 --> 00:16:46,156
This is where we separate the juveniles from adults.

184
00:16:46,239 --> 00:16:51,661
- Introducing the ever offensive Alice Cooper

185
00:16:55,082 --> 00:17:01,713
started having a hearing in Detroit,
but we were losing money.

186
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:10,138
Then a miracle happened: I got a call
Organizer Toronto Rock & Roll Revival.

187
00:17:10,222 --> 00:17:14,184
Would be the debut of John Lennon without the Beatles.

188
00:17:14,267 --> 00:17:18,939
"If this festival brings hope, maybe we can take him around the world
"

189
00:17:19,022 --> 00:17:24,361
- Said: "You could help us organize the festival"
- Le offered 30% of the profits.

190
00:17:24,444 --> 00:17:31,284
He said, "I do not want money I want my band
touch between Lennon and the Doors in prime time..."

191
00:17:31,368 --> 00:17:35,664
My choice was to give Alice
chance to shine.

192
00:17:35,747 --> 00:17:41,336
60,000.
We were tearing down the place, and it was great.

193
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:46,466
Feathers fly.
I look down and see a chicken on stage.

194
00:17:46,550 --> 00:17:52,514
The only person I could have put it there
is Shep. Nobody brings a chicken to a concert.

195
00:17:52,597 --> 00:17:56,810
No one would say: "OK, I have the keys, I have the
entries, I have my hen...".

196
00:17:56,893 --> 00:18:00,897
Thought "A hen would be perfect..."
"grabbed the hen...

197
00:18:00,981 --> 00:18:05,527
And threw up, thinking it was going to fly

198
00:18:05,610 --> 00:18:09,114
- But plummeted
- They went mad..

199
00:18:09,197 --> 00:18:12,200
- The crowd smashed
- They threw back

200
00:18:12,284 --> 00:18:16,204
wings, head, legs, flying across the stage

201
00:18:16,288 --> 00:18:21,334
I saw blood and I had to look away to see her..

202
00:18:24,337 --> 00:18:28,759
The next day the newspapers wrote that Alice
had ripped his head and drunk the blood

203
00:18:28,842 --> 00:18:35,182
What could have been a bad press
was what put us on the map.

204
00:18:35,265 --> 00:18:40,896
- Now we could do whatever we wanted.
- We had to record a hit.

205
00:18:40,979 --> 00:18:47,903
We liked The Guess Who, who had made a great album

206
00:18:51,823 --> 00:18:56,703
Went to see the producer Jack Richardson,
and he brought a young man. Bob Ezrin.

207
00:18:56,787 --> 00:19:02,209
Bob Ezrin came after "The Wall" by Pink Floyd
and "Destroyer" by Kiss. He is brilliant.

208
00:19:02,292 --> 00:19:07,964
But never produced an album,
and I invited him to New York, to see Alice.

209
00:19:08,048 --> 00:19:13,053
Jack wanted nothing to do, and sent me there
to get rid of them.

210
00:19:13,136 --> 00:19:17,849
Jack had said "under no circumstances accept
cause them to disk"

211
00:19:17,933 --> 00:19:22,437
I was put in a table below,
and all the lights went out.

212
00:19:22,521 --> 00:19:29,778
Barely lit lights and I heard him sing "Sun Arise / come every morning"

213
00:19:29,861 --> 00:19:34,032
When the lights went on, had over
face Alice Cooper

214
00:19:34,116 --> 00:19:38,203
- And everyone was dressed rarer than the side

215
00:19:38,286 --> 00:19:43,041
all wore feathers and high boots.
No one was with jeans and t...

216
00:19:43,125 --> 00:19:47,129
This was not rock and roll.
When I came out and saw people dressed like them

217
00:19:47,212 --> 00:19:50,757
- I realized it was the beginning of a cultural movement
.

218
00:19:50,841 --> 00:19:55,637
I went to the dressing and undertook to produce them the
disk. I said, "I will!"

219
00:19:55,721 --> 00:19:58,765
Alice signed with the company of Frank Zappa.

220
00:19:58,849 --> 00:20:04,646
Zappa was an artist of Warner and had negotiated for
have its own label. Straight Records.

221
00:20:04,730 --> 00:20:10,694
I went where Zappa and told him we had to Richardson
went mad and said it was the wrong type

222
00:20:10,777 --> 00:20:14,614
"He makes pop records, we do not want,
do not need it, I will pay for it"

223
00:20:14,698 --> 00:20:21,872
So I went to talk to a guy from Warner
and told him we had to Richardson

224
00:20:21,955 --> 00:20:28,086
- They would do anything to work with Richardson.
They said "Let us see how we fix it".

225
00:20:28,170 --> 00:20:35,427
Came back and said "we have the budget, do not tell anyone
. I would remove the Doobie Brothers."

226
00:20:35,510 --> 00:20:40,140
That sums up the history of the Doobies. I laugh often her.

227
00:20:44,686 --> 00:20:50,275
Recorded the album "Love it to Death"
and one of the songs was "Eighteen."

228
00:20:50,359 --> 00:20:54,696
- Could feel it would be a success.
- "He said: Yes, I like, I can sell this."

229
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:59,618
Straight refused to publish records,
Frank thought it was too commercial.

230
00:20:59,701 --> 00:21:05,707
- So we had to promote it ourselves.
- Shep was very smart to sell.

231
00:21:05,791 --> 00:21:09,461
There was a radio station in Canada
called CKLW.

232
00:21:09,544 --> 00:21:14,216
If you colocabas a song on CKLW,
other stations in America also have touch.

233
00:21:14,299 --> 00:21:21,223
- Recalled that Canada had...
... The legislation radial content.

234
00:21:21,306 --> 00:21:26,937
At least 30% Canadian content
radios must be Canadian artists.

235
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:29,940
Alice was American.

236
00:21:30,023 --> 00:21:34,861
But fortunately had recorded in Canada, so that was enough.

237
00:21:34,945 --> 00:21:40,367
CKLW programmed the record because they had to.
Was Canadian.

238
00:21:40,450 --> 00:21:46,373
When "eighteen" started up in the lists of CKLW,
the other radios in the country wanted the song.

239
00:21:46,456 --> 00:21:51,962
But nobody knew where the disc was.
Warner was flooded with calls.

240
00:21:52,045 --> 00:21:56,925
Straight refused to publish it,
Warner realized they had to do something.

241
00:21:57,009 --> 00:22:02,639
They said, "Do not tell anything
a Straight, but we'll publish it."

242
00:22:02,723 --> 00:22:08,145
The album was released by Warner. Then
Straight sued and published them.

243
00:22:08,228 --> 00:22:12,024
Told them they could not get it out in Straight,
so I again became Warner again.

244
00:22:12,107 --> 00:22:18,405
The album was released in 17 editions.
Straight, Warner, Straight, Warner...

245
00:22:18,488 --> 00:22:21,700
ended in a trial of seven or eight years.

246
00:22:21,783 --> 00:22:25,454
There were many millions of dollars.

247
00:22:25,537 --> 00:22:29,124
Never got the money, they kept it.

248
00:22:32,002 --> 00:22:35,589
We were looking for money,
and the answer was England.

249
00:22:35,672 --> 00:22:40,886
I immediately booked for Alice
Wembley Arena, which seats 10,000 seats.

250
00:22:40,969 --> 00:22:47,225
We had only sold 50 tickets. So I asked how do
met Alice in England.

251
00:22:49,686 --> 00:22:54,566
- Warner had hired a guy named Derek Taylor.
- Derek Taylor, the Beatles publicist.

252
00:22:54,649 --> 00:23:01,615
Derek was a wonderful character, smoking his cigar
and spoke very little. He created the Beatlemania.

253
00:23:01,698 --> 00:23:06,161
- Derek is true that the Beatles are finished?
- No, not until they die.

254
00:23:06,244 --> 00:23:10,957
When I arrived at the office of Derek, there were
Harry Nilsson, George Harrison

255
00:23:11,041 --> 00:23:15,629
- And Carolyn Pfeiffer, our PR
charge in England.

256
00:23:15,712 --> 00:23:21,259
My portfolio represented included Barbra Streisand, Robert Redford
, Liza Minelli, Mac Cartney and Wings...

257
00:23:21,343 --> 00:23:28,141
Selling Alice in England was part of the general plan
to make him a rock star.

258
00:23:28,225 --> 00:23:33,980
Derek asked me to tell Alice Cooper.
I told him that Alice was all parents hate.

259
00:23:34,064 --> 00:23:39,111
Alice was photographed naked with a boa constrictor
on their genitals.

260
00:23:39,194 --> 00:23:43,365
Derek said: photo, truck, Picadilly and break.

261
00:23:43,448 --> 00:23:47,077
"Parents have to hate you."

262
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:52,708
He had the idea of putting a giant poster
truck and take it to Picadilly Circus.

263
00:23:52,791 --> 00:23:57,170
Had to drive to get there
during peak hours and then getting stuck.

264
00:23:57,254 --> 00:24:00,215
Is a main artery of London.

265
00:24:00,298 --> 00:24:06,054
Shep told the driver: "Whatever happens, do not move
You'll be rewarded if they arrest us care.."

266
00:24:06,138 --> 00:24:10,267
My job as PR was to get all the press
British knew.

267
00:24:10,350 --> 00:24:14,813
So there they were, taking photographs of a naked man with a snake
.

268
00:24:14,896 --> 00:24:18,233
The traffic was completely paralyzed in the center.

269
00:24:18,316 --> 00:24:23,780
- Appeared in all media. - Worked

270
00:24:23,864 --> 00:24:30,430
-
The next day, the tickets were sold out Wembley.
- This should be a milestone in the decline of the British Empire.

271
00:24:34,750 --> 00:24:41,089
After the concert, the single
"School's Out" was No. 1 in the UK and worldwide.

272
00:24:41,173 --> 00:24:48,638
It was great to get the money, but it turned out better than
us. I congratulated myself in the mirror.

273
00:24:48,722 --> 00:24:54,019
In the album "School's Out"
really took a big jump. It all came together.

274
00:24:54,102 --> 00:24:57,314
The voices in this album are absolutely unmatched.

275
00:24:59,399 --> 00:25:03,653
The idea for the cover was that you could bend
as the deck of a school bench.

276
00:25:03,737 --> 00:25:10,827
When it hits you had things like a switchblade
and gum.

277
00:25:10,911 --> 00:25:14,164
- And Shep said, "panties".
- Panties.

278
00:25:14,247 --> 00:25:17,417
- I said "Panties!? ?!"
- Panties.

279
00:25:17,501 --> 00:25:24,716
"If you're in the seventh grade, they open the bank and have
a pair of panties, you're a king."

280
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:29,930
And Shep says: "Let panties on disk."

281
00:25:30,013 --> 00:25:33,767
Types of Warner said You know how expensive is that?

282
00:25:33,850 --> 00:25:38,105
- But Shep said: You know how revolutionary it is ?.

283
00:25:38,188 --> 00:25:42,109
The album sold millions,
and started touring around the world.

284
00:25:42,192 --> 00:25:47,030
The life revolves difficult.
Never know well where you are when you wake up.

285
00:25:47,114 --> 00:25:50,450
Alcohol and drugs were the rule.

286
00:25:50,534 --> 00:25:54,079
I could order room service at night and have a Bloody Mary
on the bedside table

287
00:25:54,162 --> 00:25:57,958
- Upon waking, looked where he was and drank.

288
00:25:58,041 --> 00:26:01,670
One of the objectives was not having to unpack

289
00:26:01,753 --> 00:26:06,133
Because so you could wake up from a night of excess
and will be nothing left in the room.

290
00:26:06,216 --> 00:26:12,222
Life on Tour was a series of lists.
Is everyone here? Are all the cars were uploaded?

291
00:26:12,305 --> 00:26:19,646
All arrived at the airport?
They searched all the luggage? Is everyone at the door?

292
00:26:19,730 --> 00:26:25,569
You You came to the place of the show and Is all the equipment? Operators
lights, the spotlights.

293
00:26:25,652 --> 00:26:30,365
Half an hour before I need my computer
uniformed and ready.

294
00:26:30,449 --> 00:26:33,493
Five minutes before the band
standing beside the stage.

295
00:26:33,577 --> 00:26:38,331
One minute before the light goes
and the show starts on time.

296
00:26:57,726 --> 00:27:01,813
The three main tasks of a manager:
1 - Getting money

297
00:27:01,897 --> 00:27:04,733
2 - Always remember you should get the money

298
00:27:04,816 --> 00:27:09,529
- And never forget that you must remember to get money

299
00:27:09,613 --> 00:27:14,034
And then make sure everyone back after the show

300
00:27:14,117 --> 00:27:19,581
- no underage women, because they attract too much attention...

301
00:27:19,664 --> 00:27:23,418
- And that is wrong.
- And because it's wrong.

302
00:27:29,591 --> 00:27:33,804
The scene on the plane of "Almost Famous"
is based on something that happened to me when I was on tour.

303
00:27:33,887 --> 00:27:39,810
We were on the plane of Alice Cooper, Cameron Crowe
going to write an article about Alice.

304
00:27:39,893 --> 00:27:43,063
An engine caught fire. We thought we were going to fall.

305
00:27:43,146 --> 00:27:47,150
A roadie shouted "
going to die!" I have to confess something "!

306
00:27:47,234 --> 00:27:53,657
Turned to a guy whose wife was pregnant
and said "I am the true father of that baby."

307
00:27:53,740 --> 00:28:00,038
Several seconds later, the pilot apologized and said he would land
smoothly.

308
00:28:00,122 --> 00:28:04,251
The next 20 minutes were very uncomfortable.

309
00:28:04,334 --> 00:28:08,004
"I did not die!"

310
00:28:08,088 --> 00:28:12,759
They made the cover of
"Billion Dollar Babies" in London.

311
00:28:12,843 --> 00:28:16,805
- I lent them my baby.
- She had a beautiful daughter. Lola, appearing

312
00:28:16,810 --> 00:28:22,894
with painted eyes in the arms of Alice.
The Godfather it was Charlie Chaplin.

313
00:28:22,978 --> 00:28:25,480
The album was very, very successful.

314
00:28:29,693 --> 00:28:34,573
There were about boys and suddenly was here
the world's biggest band

315
00:28:34,656 --> 00:28:37,993
With his private plane, knowing the
exotic people in exotic locations

316
00:28:38,076 --> 00:28:42,205
They were accepted as superstars.

317
00:29:10,192 --> 00:29:13,236
Most managers say "Oh, no, do not do that,
is bad for your image..."

318
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:17,282
- But Shep was always very positive: "Do"

319
00:29:17,366 --> 00:29:24,164
We had gotten our first stage
baseball and we were thinking of doing something awesome.

320
00:29:24,247 --> 00:29:28,085
I called and Alice and I said I have it, we're going to
fired from a cannon.

321
00:29:28,168 --> 00:29:34,341
I said, "OK." I did not say: "It is dangerous, maybe we should not do
".

322
00:29:34,424 --> 00:29:38,261
I lay on the barrel, left-side

323
00:29:38,345 --> 00:29:44,309
And while put a doll in the barrel and fired a network

324
00:29:44,393 --> 00:29:49,064
I would have arrived and appear on the other side.
That was the trick.

325
00:29:51,441 --> 00:29:56,029
Fired, there was an explosion
and the doll flew less than a meter.

326
00:29:56,113 --> 00:30:01,868
- Fell right...
- I have never seen worse.

327
00:30:01,952 --> 00:30:06,832
People screamed with laughter,
worked as a gag Inspector Clouseau.

328
00:30:06,915 --> 00:30:11,878
Ended by selling the gun to
Rolling Stones.

329
00:30:14,548 --> 00:30:18,844
I moved to Los Angeles
for business reasons.

330
00:30:18,927 --> 00:30:24,224
In full 70, had much success,
too many beautiful women, too many drugs...

331
00:30:24,307 --> 00:30:29,062
Alice had problems with alcohol,
I spent time at the Playboy Mansion.

332
00:30:29,146 --> 00:30:36,278
The first time I left my clothes next to the jacuzzi and leaving
was gone, I thought I had been stolen.

333
00:30:36,361 --> 00:30:42,826
In the Playboy Mansion had ironed people you
and left hanging clothes while you bañabas.

334
00:30:42,909 --> 00:30:46,621
Being in Playboy Mansion and ironed while you were in the jacuzzi
-

335
00:30:46,705 --> 00:30:51,084
- it was a dream for every Jewish child of Rhode Island.

336
00:30:51,168 --> 00:30:54,963
Then I met Marcy Hanson a Playboy model.
We had a very intense relationship.

337
00:30:55,047 --> 00:30:58,842
We married after a short time

338
00:30:58,925 --> 00:31:04,431
- But we realized it was a mistake and consiguimos
annul the marriage.

339
00:31:04,514 --> 00:31:07,642
Then I started making money and bought some houses.

340
00:31:07,726 --> 00:31:14,733
One of them had a train between home and
pool. I also bought Alice's house.

341
00:31:14,816 --> 00:31:20,072
People would not stop ringing the doorbell and then
discovered that the house was in the "Hollywood Stars Map."

342
00:31:20,155 --> 00:31:25,160
Then I made a poster: "Alice Does not Live Here
back and ask for a refund.".

343
00:31:25,243 --> 00:31:30,332
When I lived there I had a cat called "sensitive"
and my neighbor was Cary Grant.

344
00:31:30,415 --> 00:31:34,461
One day the cat disappeared
someone said he was in the house of Cary Grant.

345
00:31:34,544 --> 00:31:38,965
So the other day I went to touch the bell,
and his assistant opened.

346
00:31:39,049 --> 00:31:44,805
For the crack could see Cary Grant in "sensitive"
and said it was my cat.

347
00:31:44,888 --> 00:31:49,184
But his wife said I could not take the cat
that had restored the joy of living.

348
00:31:49,267 --> 00:31:53,146
So we agreed to share custody.

349
00:31:56,942 --> 00:32:02,239
It is important for me in business try to make compassionate
negotiations.

350
00:32:02,322 --> 00:32:09,246
There are no losers, only winners.
Much of this is what I call "coupons".

351
00:32:09,329 --> 00:32:14,626
By this I mean paying people
yourself doing something you do not have to do.

352
00:32:14,710 --> 00:32:18,672
I have no words to express
how nice it is to have you on my show.

353
00:32:18,755 --> 00:32:22,050
Well, some money would not hurt...

354
00:32:23,260 --> 00:32:29,224
- I met Groucho through Alice.
- Groucho saw us on TV and wanted to see our show.

355
00:32:29,307 --> 00:32:32,269
When he went to see him, I saw him as vaudeville.

356
00:32:32,352 --> 00:32:39,192
Friends with Alice were made and accompanying literally
until he fell asleep at night. They saw TV

357
00:32:39,276 --> 00:32:44,948
And Alice told me Groucho comments on
everyone who came.

358
00:32:45,032 --> 00:32:50,871
"This is gay." "In that liked the dwarfs".
"That guy was fucking the girlfriend of Zeppo".

359
00:32:50,954 --> 00:32:57,961
- Had a history of each.
- But his finances were a mess.

360
00:32:58,045 --> 00:33:04,760
Shep promised to see your finances and put things in order
to Groucho.

361
00:33:04,843 --> 00:33:08,263
- So I went Groucho manager.
- And did it for free.
Every time we met, told me:

362
00:33:08,347 --> 00:33:12,351
Each time we met, I said:
"You're My manager Shep?"

363
00:33:12,434 --> 00:33:16,063
"Curious, do not look like a criminal."

364
00:33:16,146 --> 00:33:21,693
Investigate how things had made money,
and A & M had a live album.

365
00:33:21,777 --> 00:33:26,406
Heard about Jerry Moss, who was head of A & M.
was one of the giants of the industry.

366
00:33:26,490 --> 00:33:31,953
I asked if they could give Marx
an advance against future projects.

367
00:33:32,037 --> 00:33:36,541
Jerry, being who he is, made a big
for Groucho check.

368
00:33:36,625 --> 00:33:41,421
"What else I can do to help?"
I'm still paying the coupon back.

369
00:33:41,505 --> 00:33:47,719
'll Do anything, at any time, you need
Jerry Moss. That's a coupon.

370
00:33:47,803 --> 00:33:54,935
After a time with Alice and Groucho wanted to see if my talent
working with others.

371
00:33:55,018 --> 00:33:58,855
I did not understand at all what Anne Murray.

372
00:34:01,108 --> 00:34:06,947
- She was a Canadian folk singer.
- Had the purest voice...

373
00:34:07,030 --> 00:34:09,908
... and it was a different
Alice could get.

374
00:34:09,991 --> 00:34:14,746
I was not ostentatious.
It was just a really good singer.

375
00:34:14,830 --> 00:34:21,044
Very white, very clean, very American environment.
More than half American, was Canadian.

376
00:34:21,128 --> 00:34:24,923
When I was in Los Angeles recording,
lived in the house of Shep.

377
00:34:25,007 --> 00:34:29,428
Had not only brimming refrigerator alcohol

378
00:34:29,511 --> 00:34:35,267
But also someone had put a note:
"Anne: There's a surprise for you in the drawer".

379
00:34:35,350 --> 00:34:40,939
Looked and there was a large pot of white powder.

380
00:34:45,277 --> 00:34:50,949
I did not know that was there.
I did not know that until I read his book...

381
00:34:54,453 --> 00:34:59,332
What I was looking at Shep was to give me a boost
industry

382
00:34:59,416 --> 00:35:03,211
- And all who were "somebody"
were in the " Midnight Special ".

383
00:35:03,295 --> 00:35:10,802
At a time when the wave was all, Midnight Special
had no interest in a successful Canadian singer.

384
00:35:10,886 --> 00:35:16,975
Had to do something to Annie was really
in wave.

385
00:35:17,059 --> 00:35:22,064
She would play at the Troubadour, that was very cool,
but people were totally indifferent.

386
00:35:22,147 --> 00:35:26,777
One technique I use is called
"guilt associated."

387
00:35:26,860 --> 00:35:32,908
Involves taking someone really famous and put
to another person next, and shares its brightness to another.

388
00:35:32,991 --> 00:35:35,994
Alice had a group.
The Hollywood Vampires.

389
00:35:36,078 --> 00:35:41,458
The Hollywood Vampires we were a group of drinkers:
Harry Nilsson, Mickey Dolenz and John Lennon.

390
00:35:41,541 --> 00:35:44,920
He was going through a dark age
and rarely took pictures.

391
00:35:45,003 --> 00:35:49,299
A photo of Lennon would be great.

392
00:35:49,383 --> 00:35:54,721
I said Alice, I want the Hollywood Vampires
come listen to Anne Murray.

393
00:35:54,805 --> 00:36:02,270
The goal was to get a photo of Anne
these icons, the coolest people in the world.

394
00:36:02,354 --> 00:36:06,441
- Were all cynics.
- They were in the Rainbow, so I went...

395
00:36:06,525 --> 00:36:09,528
... I knelt and begged them.

396
00:36:09,611 --> 00:36:14,991
"Boys, I represent Anne Murray,
and she will play at the Troubadour".

397
00:36:15,075 --> 00:36:21,748
"If I can take a picture with it, I'll do it for you
". They agreed.

398
00:36:21,832 --> 00:36:29,423
The picture became more evident
any other photo in my career.

399
00:36:29,506 --> 00:36:37,055
Rolling Stone wanted to interview me, I suddenly was
LA girl. For a few weeks...

400
00:36:37,139 --> 00:36:42,269
I put in "Midnight Special". It helped.

401
00:36:48,191 --> 00:36:54,740
Annie never tried to be different from herself.
It was not a Midnight Special and transformed into something else.

402
00:37:02,998 --> 00:37:09,338
Believed that Shep was crazy for taking
Anne Murray, but the truth is I hated what Alice Cooper

403
00:37:09,421 --> 00:37:13,925
He liked the folk music of Anne Murray and things
as The Spinners.

404
00:37:14,009 --> 00:37:18,138
I have liked the music of Alice
be more like The Spinners

405
00:37:18,221 --> 00:37:24,561
Soul music. That's what I like. Aretha, Etta James
, Harold Melvin & The Blue Notes.

406
00:37:24,644 --> 00:37:30,400
There was a song "Wake Up Everybody" it was my
anthem. Listened every day.

407
00:37:33,820 --> 00:37:40,202
I received a call from CBS Records "We have an artist
we think will be great and we need a good manager"

408
00:37:40,285 --> 00:37:45,290
Era Teddy Pendergrass. Never heard of him.
I went to listen to Philadelphia.

409
00:37:45,374 --> 00:37:49,169
Touched in a small club.

410
00:37:49,252 --> 00:37:56,009
The show was absolutely pitiful,
with a layer to James Brown, with fat dancers.

411
00:37:56,093 --> 00:38:02,683
But he sang "Wake Up Everybody" and I realized that was the kind of
Harold Melvin and the blue notes.

412
00:38:02,766 --> 00:38:07,896
I went to wait in the hallway to talk to him, like all Jews
managers, lined up like cattle.

413
00:38:07,979 --> 00:38:13,402
Is So I left. I never talked to Teddy.
CBS called and asked how it was.

414
00:38:13,485 --> 00:38:19,658
I'm not going to line up in the hallway to say that I am
one cool guy, so we asked for a meeting at his house.

415
00:38:19,741 --> 00:38:24,705
Outside the building was a white Rolls-Royce saying
"TEDDY" in the patent.

416
00:38:24,788 --> 00:38:30,836
I took the elevator to the penthouse and said:
"I will not take away too long I do not know much about life.."

417
00:38:30,919 --> 00:38:35,007
"But I'll tell you what I can do: I can get high more
you..."

418
00:38:35,090 --> 00:38:39,302
"... You have most beautiful women, I can
drunk than you...

419
00:38:39,386 --> 00:38:43,640
" And when landslides with silver
show in your pocket... "

420
00:38:43,724 --> 00:38:47,144
" .. . I'll be able to put that money
safe and that no one steals. "

421
00:38:47,227 --> 00:38:51,481
He said," What? "I said," Why not get together
somewhere and bring your best drugs "? .

422
00:38:51,565 --> 00:38:56,611
"And if you're still standing after that, you do not need me
. If I'm standing, you need me "

423
00:38:56,695 --> 00:39:02,409
I expected a no, but instead said yes
thought." Shit, now I have to. "

424
00:39:02,492 --> 00:39:06,621
Thought, now I need a really cool bag

425
00:39:06,705 --> 00:39:11,710
- And I bought one of wood, it hits you and
was full of drugs. It was a pharmacy.

426
00:39:11,793 --> 00:39:15,547
We smoked grass, we pull cocaine
ate mushrooms, we quaaludes...

427
00:39:15,630 --> 00:39:22,220
The women came and went. We went bad.
Three days later he collapsed.

428
00:39:22,304 --> 00:39:26,058
I was his manager for
the rest of his life.

429
00:39:26,141 --> 00:39:32,356
Best of Shep are their stories.
In mind that Alice Cooper concert somewhere

430
00:39:32,439 --> 00:39:38,528
when Alice returned to the dressing
were plenty of tables with food, sandwiches, drinks

431
00:39:38,612 --> 00:39:42,783
But a month later, Teddy Pendergrass played in the same place

432
00:39:42,866 --> 00:39:45,869
back and just had a bottle of water.

433
00:39:45,952 --> 00:39:52,626
After the show I went to ask for money from Teddy to
promoter, but said he did not have it and refused to pay

434
00:39:52,709 --> 00:39:58,382
". If you do not pay, do not leave here alive"  I said
I have no family, I have nothing to lose, I do not care

435
00:39:58,465 --> 00:40:02,636
I offered her ring, so is
I took it and went where Teddy.

436
00:40:02,719 --> 00:40:07,182
"How the hell can I get 20% of this ring?"

437
00:40:07,265 --> 00:40:12,437
I then explained about something that blew my mind,
called "Chitlin circuit '."

438
00:40:12,521 --> 00:40:16,817
Promoters  possessing radio stations,
hire artists and play their discs

439
00:40:16,900 --> 00:40:19,653
- But do not get paid a dollar.

440
00:40:19,736 --> 00:40:25,367
The artists see if the shows do not
play them on the radio and lose their contracts to record.

441
00:40:25,450 --> 00:40:32,165
This made him realize that artists were being treated
a little right way.

442
00:40:32,249 --> 00:40:35,544
I said, "Fuck it, break the circuit."

443
00:40:35,627 --> 00:40:40,632
He said: "I do not want to scare you but
You know what happened to my ex manager?"

444
00:40:40,716 --> 00:40:43,802
"The shot dead is not playing with these guys.".

445
00:40:43,885 --> 00:40:48,265
Oh shit, she was murdered?
This is serious stuff

446
00:40:48,348 --> 00:40:51,768
At that time the industry was full of gangsters.

447
00:40:51,852 --> 00:40:57,274
You had to be able to deal and cope with this
kinds of people.

448
00:40:57,357 --> 00:41:00,777
I really believe that I had nothing to lose.
Was a guy just...

449
00:41:00,861 --> 00:41:04,781
".. Fuck you write down on a white place and you will pay
I will not do that shit."

450
00:41:04,865 --> 00:41:09,745
"Then kill us I do not care.."

451
00:41:09,828 --> 00:41:13,874
Reserve the Roxy in LA, it was so white
it was like too white.

452
00:41:18,670 --> 00:41:22,507
But did the most boring show that night.
He sat on a floor.

453
00:41:22,591 --> 00:41:26,386
After the show I scolded "Motherfucker,

454
00:41:26,470 --> 00:41:29,931
"I risk my life to see how you stay
sitting on a floor?"

455
00:41:30,015 --> 00:41:34,144
"All the girls in the audience
all you want to do is throw you to death..."

456
00:41:34,227 --> 00:41:37,522
"... And then you sit in a chair, making it the cool
".

457
00:41:37,606 --> 00:41:43,111
"I'd be the only guy in the room
when you have so hot".

458
00:41:43,195 --> 00:41:48,492
Then I had an idea. "Wait a second. Let
concerts for women only."

459
00:41:54,790 --> 00:42:00,837
There have been many cries, while the Greek theater
What causes such excitement? Teddy Pendergrass.

460
00:42:00,921 --> 00:42:05,467
Last night's concert, sold out,
was only for women.

461
00:42:05,550 --> 00:42:10,305
Teddy Then he realized it was all
sex, and then came the songs

462
00:42:10,597 --> 00:42:14,643
- What do you like about it?
- His body.

463
00:42:14,726 --> 00:42:20,107
Five platinum albums in a row.
That must be a record.

464
00:42:20,190 --> 00:42:26,571
He would be the black Elvis.
We said all along to support him.

465
00:42:30,158 --> 00:42:34,162
I have nothing to lose,
I have no family, I have children, I give a shit.

466
00:42:37,833 --> 00:42:42,129
At this point in my life was very successful, but no
meant nothing.

467
00:42:42,212 --> 00:42:49,136
That was stressed about LA culture of "what" are
instead of "who" you are. Everything was so superficial.

468
00:42:49,219 --> 00:42:54,766
A friend who invited all parties,
but I wanted a family and did not have

469
00:42:54,850 --> 00:42:57,936
I had no time to woo anyone.

470
00:42:58,020 --> 00:43:02,441
All the people I met,
was damaged by fame.

471
00:43:02,524 --> 00:43:07,279
At that time, Jimi Hendrix was dead,
Jim Morrison was dead, Janis Joplin...

472
00:43:07,362 --> 00:43:13,201
- And Alice was in treatment.
Subías to the top and fall would be worse. The pattern was obvious.

473
00:43:13,285 --> 00:43:16,913
Dawned on me,
I was becoming one of them.

474
00:43:30,052 --> 00:43:33,305
Maui is the newest mass of planet Earth.

475
00:43:33,388 --> 00:43:39,436
The island has the personality of a child.
Smells sweet, like a child

476
00:43:39,519 --> 00:43:42,814
Everything has a baby has the island.

477
00:43:42,898 --> 00:43:46,318
There is an incredible innocence.

478
00:43:47,694 --> 00:43:51,365
I came to Maui in 1974.

479
00:43:51,448 --> 00:43:55,202
I knew immediately that I would stay here forever.

480
00:43:55,285 --> 00:44:00,082
Sold the house in Los Angeles
and then I moved to Maui.

481
00:44:00,165 --> 00:44:04,002
My life revolves around my home in Hawaii.

482
00:44:04,086 --> 00:44:07,714
I paid probably $ 620,000.

483
00:44:07,798 --> 00:44:11,885
Now the value is 15-20000000.

484
00:44:11,968 --> 00:44:15,055
But I do not sell ..

485
00:44:16,431 --> 00:44:22,521
I open doors for my friends,
can stay while I'm gone.

486
00:44:22,604 --> 00:44:26,191
Probably because as a child I had no friends...

487
00:44:26,274 --> 00:44:30,821
... now I'm compensating somehow

488
00:44:31,488 --> 00:44:35,867
Shep was born with a smile, and smile
accompanying since

489
00:44:35,951 --> 00:44:40,163
grew in Oceanside,
a small town in upstate New York.

490
00:44:40,247 --> 00:44:45,711
I had a good relationship with my father,
sacrificed much, but my mother kept house.

491
00:44:45,794 --> 00:44:51,591
My mom was a tough Jewish mother.
She was a cruel mistress.

492
00:44:51,675 --> 00:44:55,220
My brother, Edward,
was the star of the family.

493
00:44:55,303 --> 00:44:58,473
Shep was the black sheep of the family.

494
00:44:58,557 --> 00:45:04,813
When they gave me money for my birthday my mom
forced me to give it to my brother Edward.

495
00:45:04,896 --> 00:45:09,860
He had a dog that always biting me.

496
00:45:09,943 --> 00:45:15,032
So I grew up with no friends who were visiting me.

497
00:45:15,115 --> 00:45:20,245
- I just came from the farm.
- I just came from the beach.

498
00:45:20,454 --> 00:45:24,333
Health

499
00:45:24,791 --> 00:45:30,297
- Míra this puppy.
- What you say?

500
00:45:33,425 --> 00:45:39,639
I never had interest in food.
I was a kind of spaghetti and ketchup.

501
00:45:39,723 --> 00:45:44,811
But one night in Cannes, took me to the
restaurant Le Moulin de Mougins.

502
00:45:44,895 --> 00:45:50,609
There were all Hollywood stars,
and then came an elegant gentleman with white hair.

503
00:45:50,692 --> 00:45:56,740
Everyone turned. James Coburn and Anthony Quinn
jumped to greet him.

504
00:45:56,823 --> 00:46:00,327
I do not know who he was, but I was attracted
about him

505
00:46:00,410 --> 00:46:04,289
I immediately decided that he was someone who would like to learn
.

506
00:46:04,373 --> 00:46:08,960
I then told it was the chef Roger Verge
5 stars Michelin.

507
00:46:09,044 --> 00:46:12,631
The founder of nouvelle cuisine.

508
00:46:12,714 --> 00:46:18,178
I was pretty tipsy and went where
sr. Verge, who sat with Picasso.

509
00:46:18,261 --> 00:46:23,975
Not true. Picasso died in 1973.
actually Shep was very flown.

510
00:46:24,059 --> 00:46:27,646
Maybe it was not Picasso.
I was pretty blown that night.

511
00:46:27,729 --> 00:46:32,109
I said:
"Lord, I would be his grasshopper".

512
00:46:32,192 --> 00:46:36,321
He replied in a very bad English:
"What do you mean grasshopper?"

513
00:46:36,405 --> 00:46:39,991
Said he was a cook.

514
00:46:40,075 --> 00:46:44,037
I said I would cook for
learn from it.

515
00:46:44,121 --> 00:46:47,249
Then we became friends

516
00:46:47,332 --> 00:46:52,796
- Y
traveled together five or six weeks a year.

517
00:46:52,879 --> 00:46:59,011
Verge helped me to realize that
can be successful and happy.

518
00:46:59,094 --> 00:47:02,597
I had only seen the success and suffering

519
00:47:02,681 --> 00:47:06,435
He was the first person I saw with
success.

520
00:47:06,518 --> 00:47:12,691
Competent and respected,
and he was always happy.

521
00:47:12,774 --> 00:47:17,863
His happiness came from the fact
always put others before him.

522
00:47:17,946 --> 00:47:20,991
Mr. Verge taught me the art of
dinner.

523
00:47:21,074 --> 00:47:27,289
Puts a signal, shells or something, announcing
there's a party at home.

524
00:47:27,372 --> 00:47:32,252
It's almost like there's invitation.
It is understood and is not discussed.

525
00:47:32,336 --> 00:47:36,673
The idea is that everyone feels so good
as possible.

526
00:47:36,757 --> 00:47:42,846
One must fully focus on your guests.
Is not about what YOU want.

527
00:47:42,929 --> 00:47:49,227
If you have young, bright light.
If they are old, soft lighting.

528
00:47:49,311 --> 00:47:52,814
The roundtables make all equally important.

529
00:47:52,898 --> 00:47:58,612
If you are famous and sits with people who look what amazed
without a word -

530
00:47:58,695 --> 00:48:03,784
- can be uncomfortable.
You nobody will request an autograph in my house.

531
00:48:03,867 --> 00:48:07,662
Invite people you do not know but maybe
want to.

532
00:48:07,746 --> 00:48:13,919
He presented me with Clint Eastwood,
and said: have fun.

533
00:48:14,002 --> 00:48:16,922
"What the fuck..." thought Clint, but had to be
me, Shep told him.

534
00:48:17,005 --> 00:48:22,386
Shep asked me if I wanted to Luau
on Schwarzenegger and Sly.

535
00:48:22,469 --> 00:48:27,140
I had no idea he was so
gourmand.

536
00:48:27,224 --> 00:48:34,147
But there I was, in a great
wonderful dinner with friends and acquaintances.

537
00:48:34,231 --> 00:48:40,862
There they were. Schwarzenegger, Stallone... it was like being in Madame Tussaud
but with pork.

538
00:48:40,946 --> 00:48:46,118
Mr. Verge taught me that if there was someone who wanted to know all
-

539
00:48:46,201 --> 00:48:51,331
- had to leave an empty chair
each table, so the person can go CHANGING.

540
00:48:51,415 --> 00:48:57,004
Are also those with whom one should sit
. Usually I end up sitting with them.

541
00:48:57,087 --> 00:49:03,969
If I hear someone talk business, I go directly to the table.
If you start to harass someone, they never convidarán you.

542
00:49:04,052 --> 00:49:09,349
At some point the party is over, although some
knowing.

543
00:49:09,433 --> 00:49:13,854
You can not just kick people,
so I'm going to bed and leave you all there.

544
00:49:21,278 --> 00:49:26,366
For most live on an island like Maui
means losing touch with the world.

545
00:49:26,450 --> 00:49:30,245
But Shep Gorden is the link -

546
00:49:30,328 --> 00:49:34,207
- The meeting point of all important
people worldwide.

547
00:49:34,291 --> 00:49:39,296
All end in Maui, somewhere
and end up in the kitchen of Shep.

548
00:49:40,464 --> 00:49:44,092
Shep's house in Hawaii is like a sanctuary.

549
00:49:44,176 --> 00:49:48,263
There was a period in my life,
it was very difficult for me.

550
00:49:48,347 --> 00:49:54,353
I called him and told him I wanted to stay
with him for a week.

551
00:49:54,436 --> 00:49:59,483
"
I know I probably should wait for an invitation from you."

552
00:49:59,566 --> 00:50:03,904
However, he said,
that the door was open when I wanted.

553
00:50:03,987 --> 00:50:07,657
I was there for two months.

554
00:50:07,741 --> 00:50:11,578
He fed me  -

555
00:50:11,661 --> 00:50:16,166
- And took care of me as if I were a fallen
nest bird.

556
00:50:16,249 --> 00:50:23,548
He is a protector.
He keeps the wolf away.

557
00:50:23,632 --> 00:50:28,845
One problem with Hawaii,
as in many places,

558
00:50:28,929 --> 00:50:33,600
- It is a good resting place for celebrities
,

559
00:50:33,684 --> 00:50:38,480
But you have to live with the paparazzi.

560
00:50:38,563 --> 00:50:44,027
And not everyone wants to be seen when in the water,
like a beached whale.

561
00:50:44,778 --> 00:50:50,951
An idiot tomes some pictures of me without
Shirt Four Seasons

562
00:50:51,034 --> 00:50:55,706
- And for two consecutive years was there
"Beached Whale" in the Enquirer.

563
00:50:55,789 --> 00:50:58,875
The hit in the refrigerator as
inspiration to lose weight. It did not work.

564
00:50:58,959 --> 00:51:02,587
Shep pledged to deal with the problem.

565
00:51:02,671 --> 00:51:06,842
Sounded like a mafioso. "Ready"
Did you kill him?

566
00:51:06,925 --> 00:51:09,970
That would be fine,
but agreed with him.

567
00:51:10,053 --> 00:51:14,099
- The phone rang.
- Hello Derek. Is Shep.

568
00:51:14,182 --> 00:51:18,228
"Yes, Shep, I was."
"Then. How do we do?"

569
00:51:18,311 --> 00:51:22,441
- "Both should be happy."
- I took some time...

570
00:51:22,524 --> 00:51:26,069
... And I just ask you to let me make some shots
occasionally

571
00:51:26,153 --> 00:51:32,117
The wedding was in Shep,
and could be seen from the beach.

572
00:51:32,200 --> 00:51:36,079
Did not want to take pictures of people.

573
00:51:36,163 --> 00:51:40,751
- So spoke with Derek.
- I photographed the wedding of Tom Arnold, where Shep.

574
00:51:40,834 --> 00:51:45,714
Derek walked over and took a picture,
and no one else, not people on the beach.

575
00:51:45,797 --> 00:51:49,259
I knew who the other paparazzi
and had a guy on the beach,

576
00:51:49,343 --> 00:51:55,057
- Keeping out two other photographers
and I follow him.

577
00:51:55,140 --> 00:51:59,686
I wanted to keep happy happy Shep
celebrities, mostly.

578
00:51:59,770 --> 00:52:03,940
Shep never speaks of revenge

579
00:52:04,024 --> 00:52:07,861
- Find ways to work things out.

580
00:52:09,237 --> 00:52:15,243
Shep not the stars dazzle,
but with women.

581
00:52:15,369 --> 00:52:21,917
My favorite girlfriend Shep, the first, was Winona
With that felt more connection.

582
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:26,963
Met Winona Williams in the 70s on a blind date.

583
00:52:27,047 --> 00:52:32,803
Era model, very beautiful, that night she moved.
Then came his daughter Mia.

584
00:52:32,886 --> 00:52:36,014
Live together for three years.

585
00:52:36,098 --> 00:52:40,602
Unfortunately, parted,
and moved to the east coast.

586
00:52:40,686 --> 00:52:44,439
I did not see them for 15 years.

587
00:52:44,523 --> 00:52:49,361
In 1991 Winona
called me and said that Mia was dead.

588
00:52:49,444 --> 00:52:52,906
And for the funeral
saw these four young, beautiful angels.

589
00:52:52,989 --> 00:52:56,827
I did not know that Mia had children.

590
00:52:56,910 --> 00:53:03,750
I told Winona, I have resources,
I do not know if I have emotions, but I have resources

591
00:53:03,834 --> 00:53:07,963
"If you are you going to raise for the next 18 years,
I'll pay for it."

592
00:53:08,046 --> 00:53:12,509
Saw a lot of kids, they were hers
,

593
00:53:12,592 --> 00:53:17,472
- And he loved her so much,
that motivated the decision.

594
00:53:17,556 --> 00:53:22,144
- And he loved her so much,
decision was consolidated.

595
00:53:22,227 --> 00:53:27,941
- In a few days I bought a house for them,
moved, and began the journey.

596
00:53:28,025 --> 00:53:31,194
- Here comes Chase
This is our beautiful home.

597
00:53:31,278 --> 00:53:36,241
I took a year before meeting,
I was busy with my clients

598
00:53:36,324 --> 00:53:42,831
- And I probably had a little scary.
But eventually I decided to visit them.

599
00:53:42,914 --> 00:53:48,211
's A big kiss!

600
00:53:48,712 --> 00:53:53,800
Shortly after we had met with Shep,
then took us on vacation to Disney World.

601
00:53:53,884 --> 00:54:00,682
I had always wanted to go but never had as a child
.

602
00:54:00,766 --> 00:54:04,102
I grew up without parents. My mom died when I was three.

603
00:54:04,186 --> 00:54:09,232
So the entry of this man,
this father figure who helped us grow

604
00:54:09,316 --> 00:54:13,653
- and helped us understand the world
was really a blessing.

605
00:54:13,737 --> 00:54:18,367
Was one thing to support them and give them gifts like children

606
00:54:18,450 --> 00:54:21,495
- But he was there all the time.

607
00:54:21,578 --> 00:54:25,123
I met them when the children were small.

608
00:54:25,207 --> 00:54:30,545
When going for a swim, then came to my house

609
00:54:30,629 --> 00:54:34,257
- We bathed and accompanied me to cook on the grill.

610
00:54:34,341 --> 00:54:37,928
Know these kids long
and I feel a great love for them.

611
00:54:38,261 --> 00:54:44,768
- I call Shep grandfather.
- He is a father figure and role model.

612
00:54:44,851 --> 00:54:47,771
- I love it.
- We love each other.

613
00:54:47,854 --> 00:54:54,736
I always had the hope of getting a
family, and suddenly I was there.

614
00:54:58,907 --> 00:55:01,952
Hello.

615
00:55:02,035 --> 00:55:06,456
He loves children.
My sister had a baby.

616
00:55:06,540 --> 00:55:13,088
Never seen her like this, cradling,
is a side Shep did not know.

617
00:55:13,171 --> 00:55:20,178
He would be a great father,
and I can see having a child.

618
00:55:23,640 --> 00:55:27,936
He has always been,
family oriented.

619
00:55:28,020 --> 00:55:34,526
Always knew that energy, family and love
are what drives the artist.

620
00:55:34,609 --> 00:55:40,657
The word "mensch" is synonymous with Shep.
(Yiddish word for someone noble and full)

621
00:55:40,741 --> 00:55:45,787
A mensch is reliable,
and he is always there for you-

622
00:55:45,871 --> 00:55:49,041
- In good times and bad

623
00:55:49,124 --> 00:55:56,131
Shep has helped many,
the have been quite hard.

624
00:55:56,214 --> 00:56:00,177
Shep has taught me loyalty,
because he is so loyal.

625
00:56:00,260 --> 00:56:06,475
Carolyn's daughter, Lola,
died of sudden infant death syndrome.

626
00:56:06,558 --> 00:56:09,853
Carolyn
called and said that juntáramos us

627
00:56:09,936 --> 00:56:14,775
wanted to get away from England.
The memory of Lola made him very painful.

628
00:56:14,858 --> 00:56:19,905
Carolyn received with open arms.

629
00:56:19,988 --> 00:56:25,577
She wanted to make films,
so I started to do them.

630
00:56:25,661 --> 00:56:29,081
- We Did "The Duellists."
- The first film by Ridley Scott.

631
00:56:29,164 --> 00:56:36,672
- Won at Cannes in 1977.
... Ridley Scott "The Duellists."

632
00:56:36,755 --> 00:56:42,427
- Also did "Roadie".
- There were my clients: Alice and Blondie.

633
00:56:42,511 --> 00:56:46,723
Dimnos Then we realized that we did not like the movie studios

634
00:56:46,807 --> 00:56:49,518
- So we began Island Alive.

635
00:56:49,601 --> 00:56:53,772
We pioneered the American independent cinema.

636
00:56:53,855 --> 00:56:57,567
Carolyn was the first woman president of a study
.

637
00:56:57,651 --> 00:57:01,947
Thanks to Shep, I was the only woman
could approve movies.

638
00:57:02,072 --> 00:57:08,620
We had a very low budget, but he gave me
leeway.

639
00:57:08,704 --> 00:57:14,042
- We made incredible movies.
- First we bought was "Koyaanisqatsi".

640
00:57:14,126 --> 00:57:18,255
People thought we were crazy, the title was unpronounceable

641
00:57:18,338 --> 00:57:22,592
- And no actors, no narration,
but we believed in it.

642
00:57:22,676 --> 00:57:27,723
Made "Red Headed Stranger".
(Film about Willie Nelson, 1975)

643
00:57:27,806 --> 00:57:31,309
I had to do the film,
and Shep could distribute.

644
00:57:31,393 --> 00:57:34,521
Think we won 7 or $ 8 with her.

645
00:57:34,604 --> 00:57:39,651
- "Kiss of the Spider Woman".
- The Oscar winner William Hurt is.

646
00:57:40,027 --> 00:57:46,199
We do not compare it to anything.
Alive was Miramax, before Miramax

647
00:57:46,283 --> 00:57:50,829
- I think Harvey Weinstein would agree.
- Not at all.

648
00:57:52,873 --> 00:57:56,501
Early in my career, I read a book called
"Billion Dollar Baby".

649
00:57:56,585 --> 00:58:00,964
In it was a character, Shep Gordon
wielding a troop of madmen.

650
00:58:01,048 --> 00:58:07,971
I wanted to make a rock version of
"Citizen Kane" with Shep: "Citizen Insane".

651
00:58:21,401 --> 00:58:27,366
Probably the role was not for me, because Shep is fierce
I.

652
00:58:29,534 --> 00:58:33,830
- Okay, Alice?
- Yes, come.

653
00:58:33,914 --> 00:58:38,001
Met Shep Gordon in 1991
when we did "Wayne's World".

654
00:58:38,085 --> 00:58:42,089
Mike wanted to use
"Eighteen" and "School's Out"

655
00:58:42,172 --> 00:58:46,635
- But I had an agenda.
- Shep said:

656
00:58:46,718 --> 00:58:51,264
"How about if they use some of
new album?" I said "What if no".

657
00:58:51,348 --> 00:58:57,396
He replied: "I start the
filming in about two weeks have no choice.".

658
00:58:57,479 --> 00:59:01,483
Was able to take a strong position.
Reasonable, but strong.

659
00:59:01,650 --> 00:59:07,072
Said "I read the script The band will play only eight seconds.."
No one will notice.

660
00:59:07,155 --> 00:59:12,160
"School's Out If you put in the closing credits
think it was that."

661
00:59:19,167 --> 00:59:22,295
Stay here, hang out with us.

662
00:59:22,379 --> 00:59:26,883
Cheers, yes, we can stay to hang out with you.

663
00:59:26,967 --> 00:59:30,053
With Alice Cooper...

664
00:59:31,138 --> 00:59:34,474
We are not worthy,
are not worthy.

665
00:59:34,558 --> 00:59:40,605
Since that day we spent at each airport,
hear "I am not worthy" hundreds of times

666
00:59:40,689 --> 00:59:44,860
The red carpet was filled
some of the biggest names in the film industry.

667
00:59:44,943 --> 00:59:48,030
's A Dior dress.
Thanks for asking.

668
00:59:48,113 --> 00:59:51,324
Met Sharon Stone at the Cannes Film Festival.

669
00:59:51,408 --> 00:59:54,453
"Total Recall" came out,
and I was there with -

670
00:59:54,536 --> 00:59:58,206
- Michael Douglas, Mick Jagger
and Roman Polanski.

671
00:59:58,290 --> 01:00:02,419
The party was in the home built for Josephine Napoleon
-

672
01:00:02,502 --> 01:00:07,049
- And that was surrounded by water.
It was absolutely wonderful.

673
01:00:07,132 --> 01:00:12,054
- Sharon entered the room.
- She was incredibly beautiful.

674
01:00:12,137 --> 01:00:18,352
- She entered and presented to Michael and me.
- Said "Oh, what a beautiful home."

675
01:00:18,435 --> 01:00:23,023
- "Thanks," said Shep.
- "I can show you around."

676
01:00:23,106 --> 01:00:28,695
I did not say it was mine, but he hinted
.

677
01:00:28,779 --> 01:00:33,116
"Want to show you around?"
"Thank you. I love it."

678
01:00:33,200 --> 01:00:36,536
And I saw no more that day.

679
01:00:36,620 --> 01:00:44,127
Our little ballet opened.
We were together for a few years.

680
01:00:45,545 --> 01:00:49,216
Sharon, like other women, I was first attracted by its Beauty-

681
01:00:49,299 --> 01:00:54,346
- But there is great depth in it, is
a spiritual person.

682
01:00:54,429 --> 01:00:57,891
Sharon asked me
I would meet with the Dalai Lama.

683
01:00:57,974 --> 01:01:02,312
His Holiness talked about compassion,
to love and serve others.

684
01:01:02,396 --> 01:01:06,775
It was very touching.
We were allowed to go backstage.

685
01:01:06,858 --> 01:01:14,282
When he enters feel like I have taken
the biggest shower of my life. A return to innocence.

686
01:01:14,366 --> 01:01:20,247
When I would go to Hawaii,
I called their representatives

687
01:01:20,330 --> 01:01:24,668
As through Mr. Verge was now involved in the kitchen

688
01:01:24,751 --> 01:01:30,090
- I explained that I'd
cook for the Dalai Lama.

689
01:01:30,173 --> 01:01:34,886
Was the beginning of the incorporation of Shep
in the Tibetan world.

690
01:01:34,970 --> 01:01:39,933
Researched on Tibetan food
to use some yak.

691
01:01:40,017 --> 01:01:45,063
I got some yak butter
and my kitchen stank for weeks.

692
01:01:45,147 --> 01:01:50,068
In the Tibetans love tea with yak butter.
Especially the elderly.

693
01:01:50,152 --> 01:01:53,447
Said that I do
should expect a meeting.

694
01:01:53,530 --> 01:01:58,869
But at five o'clock
I had to make breakfast for him.

695
01:01:58,952 --> 01:02:03,957
I was so surprised,
I did not think we would find.

696
01:02:04,041 --> 01:02:10,756
I went to his apartment,
and was brushing his teeth.

697
01:02:10,839 --> 01:02:16,887
"Yak tea?"
"Yes," I replied proudly.

698
01:02:16,970 --> 01:02:20,557
"So I went to Tibet."

699
01:02:23,018 --> 01:02:26,271
Traveled to New York,
and I traveled with him

700
01:02:26,355 --> 01:02:31,693
wanted to be helpful. He was a good friend,
was the manager of the hotel "The Mark".

701
01:02:31,777 --> 01:02:35,947
Let his holiness stay there for free.

702
01:02:36,031 --> 01:02:41,620
I went from being a chef to have a
seat on the Board of the Tibet Fund.

703
01:02:41,703 --> 01:02:47,209
I bought the bed in which the Dalai Lama
slept in the hotel my friend in New York.

704
01:02:47,292 --> 01:02:50,295
Which is used in Hawaii. This will leave him with his rice.

705
01:02:50,379 --> 01:02:54,758
"S rich to poor,
and happy those who are sad...

706
01:02:54,841 --> 01:02:59,137
... And desperate to find hope."

707
01:02:59,221 --> 01:03:03,809
"That fearful stop being afraid,
and the weak find strength..."

708
01:03:03,892 --> 01:03:09,272
".... And their hearts unite in friendship
" Rice of His holiness.

709
01:03:10,565 --> 01:03:17,322
Without sounding too arrogant,
I think there is a good karma.

710
01:03:17,989 --> 01:03:20,993
Teddy and I used to discuss the karma.

711
01:03:21,076 --> 01:03:27,332
Our last conversation was in London,
where he refused to act, with the theater sold.

712
01:03:27,416 --> 01:03:30,836
Tried to explain what the karma.

713
01:03:30,919 --> 01:03:34,006
"Is already all sold, Teddy."

714
01:03:34,089 --> 01:03:39,720
"It's people who work and have
organized his life around tonight."

715
01:03:39,803 --> 01:03:47,477
"They're sitting there now
'll regret if you do not Mucho soon..."

716
01:03:47,561 --> 01:03:51,023
But he refused. And next week...

717
01:03:51,106 --> 01:03:54,484
Teddy Pendergrass was seriously injured today

718
01:03:54,568 --> 01:03:59,281
- When his car collided with a pair of
trees in Philadelphia.

719
01:03:59,364 --> 01:04:05,412
The artist of 31 years old, was caught
for 45 minutes before firefighters arrived.

720
01:04:05,495 --> 01:04:08,582
The doctor told me immediately -

721
01:04:08,665 --> 01:04:13,920
-
I have to tell you that you can not walk again.

722
01:04:14,004 --> 01:04:20,093
Walked in and he was in a frame,
revolving ten minutes.

723
01:04:20,177 --> 01:04:25,515
I could only blink.
Once for the "yes" and two for "no."

724
01:04:28,101 --> 01:04:31,646
It was not my favorite moment.

725
01:04:34,232 --> 01:04:38,028
It was a good time.

726
01:04:38,111 --> 01:04:45,243
Think it was the beginning of the end.
I stopped enjoying my work.

727
01:04:45,327 --> 01:04:51,708
It was a tough time.
I loved him and still do.

728
01:04:56,797 --> 01:05:01,259
Decided not to let anyone see Teddy.

729
01:05:01,343 --> 01:05:06,306
Everyone wanted a
interview or photo.

730
01:05:06,390 --> 01:05:12,688
Should something be done, would
to tell the story he wanted to tell...

731
01:05:12,771 --> 01:05:17,442
not going to be a victim.
My job was to keep each ammo -

732
01:05:17,526 --> 01:05:22,572
- To revive his career.
And then announced the Live Aid.

733
01:05:22,656 --> 01:05:26,994
Is one of the biggest concerts of the world
front of the largest audience of TV

734
01:05:27,077 --> 01:05:30,872
One of the concerts are going to do in Philadelphia

735
01:05:30,956 --> 01:05:34,793
- And nobody knew what had happened.
They had not seen in three years

736
01:05:34,876 --> 01:05:39,464
I asked Ashford & Simpson,
if you would at Live Aid.

737
01:05:39,548 --> 01:05:45,262
Teddy was afraid to sing in front of people, but eventually agreed
.

738
01:05:45,345 --> 01:05:49,599
When we got to the ramp leading to the stage
said:

739
01:05:49,683 --> 01:05:54,021
"I can not, I'm too scared Shep.".

740
01:05:54,104 --> 01:05:58,525
I said, "I love you,
but I'll bring up there."

741
01:05:58,608 --> 01:06:03,113
Not have to sing, do whatever you want
up there, but rises "

742
01:06:03,196 --> 01:06:07,409
someone we love dearly...

743
01:06:07,492 --> 01:06:13,749
... It will make its first appearance
long. Teddy Pendergrass

744
01:06:41,818 --> 01:06:48,033
=! = I was nervous that there would end
song, but it was fantastic.

745
01:06:48,116 --> 01:06:52,913
There was no one with dry eyes It was beautiful..

746
01:07:08,470 --> 01:07:11,598
When you are the manager of someone
never ends.

747
01:07:11,682 --> 01:07:15,477
If the disc is a success,
What will you do tomorrow?

748
01:07:15,560 --> 01:07:22,693
Since I learned to cook, I appreciate
when the meal is finished, the meal ends.

749
01:07:24,611 --> 01:07:27,614
After traveling with Mr. Verge
for almost a decade

750
01:07:27,698 --> 01:07:31,868
- then he asked if I could be your tour manager
.

751
01:07:31,952 --> 01:07:34,913
He toured as a rock star.

752
01:07:34,997 --> 01:07:39,960
His fans came, ate and then getting his autograph
, bought his book

753
01:07:40,043 --> 01:07:45,048
went to an event that cost $ 2,500 per person
and saw that he was not paid

754
01:07:45,132 --> 01:07:48,635
Since I was not allowed to eat in the restaurant.

755
01:07:48,719 --> 01:07:52,514
I said "Mr. Verge, this is not fair, let me
help."

756
01:07:52,597 --> 01:07:59,312
A little later, I told Wolfgang Puck
and told me that all the chefs were treated well.

757
01:07:59,396 --> 01:08:02,941
Three days later Wolfgang
invited me to lunch at "Spago"

758
01:08:03,025 --> 01:08:08,322
- And when I walked in, sat there,
35 of the best chefs in the world.

759
01:08:08,405 --> 01:08:14,328
Wanted to help "Nor pay us, treat us like shit
."

760
01:08:14,411 --> 01:08:17,706
I started
"Alive Culinary Resources".

761
01:08:17,789 --> 01:08:24,463
I overcame. Theirs is making music, making movies...
I do not need you here.

762
01:08:24,546 --> 01:08:27,924
In economic terms, it was not prudent.

763
01:08:28,008 --> 01:08:33,096
Artists represented as Luther Vandross,
earn more in one night

764
01:08:33,180 --> 01:08:38,518
- That any chef in a year.
Only earn money by cooking in a building

765
01:08:38,602 --> 01:08:43,899
- And nobody knew how to capitalize and expand their talents
.

766
01:08:43,982 --> 01:08:50,155
Thought: All shops are driven by celebrities,
except supermarkets.

767
01:08:50,238 --> 01:08:53,742
In the sports shop had
Michael Jordan shoes.

768
01:08:53,825 --> 01:08:57,871
While in the supermarket used "chefs" generic fictitious.

769
01:08:57,954 --> 01:09:04,336
How is it makes people see the chef as
a celebrity? TV.

770
01:09:04,419 --> 01:09:09,591
We roast the chicken,
today "The French Chef".

771
01:09:09,675 --> 01:09:14,721
At first there was only Julia Child
in PBS. There was no other.

772
01:09:14,805 --> 01:09:20,227
But there was a man take
CNN trying to walk a cooking channel.

773
01:09:20,310 --> 01:09:25,649
Saw the food channel
as a key to success.

774
01:09:25,732 --> 01:09:29,528
I said:
I get, free all chefs

775
01:09:29,611 --> 01:09:34,282
- And put enormous eyes,
television as salaries are outlandish.

776
01:09:34,366 --> 01:09:39,287
- Welcome to TV Food Network.
- Emeril was the first to sign for a show.

777
01:09:39,371 --> 01:09:45,043
We have our spices, our
shrimp and our vegetables.

778
01:09:45,127 --> 01:09:51,383
Change the TV for the right
have our own advertising.

779
01:09:51,466 --> 01:09:54,594
Emeril and I talked about what was only her kitchen.

780
01:09:54,678 --> 01:09:57,431
It was... BAM, that way!

781
01:09:57,514 --> 01:10:01,351
Said people asked about
"Bam" and spices.

782
01:10:01,435 --> 01:10:05,439
Bam, just like that!
We put a couple of these and Bam! well no more!

783
01:10:05,522 --> 01:10:09,943
- And now a few of these and Bam! well no more!
- And so began with Emeril spices.

784
01:10:10,027 --> 01:10:16,199
- Spice up your roast chicken with my mix for chicken.
- Sales skyrocketed.

785
01:10:16,283 --> 01:10:23,040
Today is the most popular spice market
. This is due to the vision of Shep.

786
01:10:23,123 --> 01:10:27,085
It was a way to put their products in stores

787
01:10:27,169 --> 01:10:30,672
- And now, people could achieve the same
taste of Emeril.

788
01:10:30,756 --> 01:10:37,012
- That gave him the idea to other chefs like Mario Batali.
- Saltimbocca... at Batali style.

789
01:10:37,095 --> 01:10:43,810
And he spread the sauce to the pasta and
cookware. A huge business.

790
01:10:43,894 --> 01:10:50,275
No sio work would not for Emeril.
Paved the way for all the famous chefs.

791
01:10:50,359 --> 01:10:55,572
I did it for free, so I wanted to have
success and retire. It was hard work.

792
01:10:55,656 --> 01:11:00,202
I knew I had created a new category:
-Celebrity Chefs.

793
01:11:00,285 --> 01:11:03,538
So I chose to retire.

794
01:11:03,622 --> 01:11:07,334
I felt I had used my life to live the lives of others

795
01:11:07,417 --> 01:11:12,756
- And I wanted to see what it was MY life.
I could only do retiring.

796
01:11:12,839 --> 01:11:16,635
Called my clients and most were very understanding.

797
01:11:16,718 --> 01:11:21,181
But Luther was very hurt and I erased
of his autobiography.

798
01:11:21,264 --> 01:11:26,520
When Shep hired me,
was half removed.

799
01:11:26,603 --> 01:11:31,775
Sometimes I feel we changed roles:
the care me rather than I him.

800
01:11:31,858 --> 01:11:38,865
I was still manager of Alice, rather than a customer
was like a part of my body.

801
01:11:40,534 --> 01:11:47,958
One day a friend called me and told me I had one chef
healthy food to be his manager.

802
01:11:48,041 --> 01:11:53,463
I explained that no longer did and
I did not like that food

803
01:11:53,547 --> 01:12:00,762
- But I told him we could get together.
The doorbell rang, and entered Renée, a beautiful vision.

804
01:12:00,846 --> 01:12:05,767
Was love at first sight.
It had everything I wanted.

805
01:12:05,851 --> 01:12:11,023
I knew it was serious when he told me
"She makes this" healthy food ""...

806
01:12:11,106 --> 01:12:17,654
He said he loved, but I know he knows
shit, I grew up on a farm and I know.

807
01:12:19,072 --> 01:12:25,787
I woke up thinking about her,
but has never been easy for me to say what I feel.

808
01:12:25,871 --> 01:12:29,291
Yes it was easy possible to stay in my guest house
.

809
01:12:29,374 --> 01:12:35,255
The next five nights cook,
walked along the beach and met.

810
01:12:35,339 --> 01:12:38,717
A fifth night the relationship became more intimate
-

811
01:12:38,800 --> 01:12:42,637
- the sixth day she moved to live here.

812
01:12:44,765 --> 01:12:49,728
Two years later
married in a beautiful ceremony in Maui.

813
01:12:49,811 --> 01:12:54,399
We had invited
65 friends and family members.

814
01:12:55,567 --> 01:13:02,699
Michael Douglas said in his speech that many have
problems with a woman 30 years younger.

815
01:13:02,783 --> 01:13:08,538
"I gave Shep some tips:
If she dies, he dies."

816
01:13:11,541 --> 01:13:17,422
We went on honeymoon to Fiji, an island
you only get one guest at a time.

817
01:13:17,506 --> 01:13:22,594
Upon arrival we were told that there was another
couple on the island, but no bother.

818
01:13:22,678 --> 01:13:27,516
Renee  The computer did not work,
so I went to get help from the reception.

819
01:13:27,599 --> 01:13:30,811
Five minutes later, the doorbell rang
.

820
01:13:30,894 --> 01:13:37,442
Was Steve Jobs, the other guest.
Steve Jobs arranged her team.

821
01:13:37,526 --> 01:13:42,030
Renée
finished cooking for him over the next five days.

822
01:13:42,114 --> 01:13:45,325
Was one of the magical moments of my life
.

823
01:13:45,993 --> 01:13:49,579
When we returned,
I could not avoid being his manager.

824
01:13:49,663 --> 01:13:53,625
She managed to publish a book,
and helped her get a TV.

825
01:13:53,709 --> 01:13:58,672
I could not help it,
was all he knew.

826
01:13:58,755 --> 01:14:03,343
I told Renee that wanted children.

827
01:14:03,427 --> 01:14:09,558
Working on it, but she became pregnant
no. Simplememnte was not.

828
01:14:09,641 --> 01:14:13,020
Some can cope without children

829
01:14:13,103 --> 01:14:20,152
- But habemos others that, in that case,
we lack something. Shep is one of them.

830
01:14:20,235 --> 01:14:23,488
I said we should go to the doctor

831
01:14:23,572 --> 01:14:26,867
- But Renée
thought should happen naturally.

832
01:14:26,950 --> 01:14:30,829
I respetabasu opinion,
but I did not agree with it

833
01:14:30,912 --> 01:14:37,336
After that we grew apart, and ended
divorciándonos.

834
01:14:54,603 --> 01:14:58,690
I have no idea who
I will leave it when you die.

835
01:14:58,774 --> 01:15:02,235
I do not know.

836
01:15:02,319 --> 01:15:05,530
No I have taken care of that yet.

837
01:15:07,866 --> 01:15:15,040
On January 13, 2012
Shep despés to play golf again.

838
01:15:15,624 --> 01:15:22,422
I asked how he felt.
She said her stomach hurt, it was swollen.

839
01:15:22,506 --> 01:15:29,304
Usually play nine holes,
so it was no surprise to leave.

840
01:15:29,388 --> 01:15:34,267
- Left us and went home.
- He went out.

841
01:15:34,351 --> 01:15:38,313
I asked if he wanted to stay with him,
but told me to go home.

842
01:15:38,397 --> 01:15:42,609
I was a little worried.

843
01:15:42,693 --> 01:15:48,198
He sent me a message. "Can you come?"
I went and saw that I was suffering a lot.

844
01:15:48,281 --> 01:15:51,827
Thought: I have to take him to hospital.

845
01:15:51,910 --> 01:15:56,707
Arrived at the emergency room, and put
enough drugs to sleep an elephant.

846
01:15:56,790 --> 01:16:02,129
The doctor said it was like a heart attack
in the small intestine.

847
01:16:02,212 --> 01:16:07,092
If not operated, Shep die.

848
01:16:07,175 --> 01:16:14,141
If the surgery was done, would
only 20% chance of survival.

849
01:16:17,269 --> 01:16:22,107
Were isolated for four days.
No one knew what happened.

850
01:16:22,190 --> 01:16:29,573
My phone rang constantly.
Everyone wanted to know how he was.

851
01:16:29,656 --> 01:16:32,534
Not many people survive such an operation.

852
01:16:32,617 --> 01:16:36,288
Had finally achieved a good relationship with this man
.

853
01:16:36,371 --> 01:16:43,045
And the possibility of no return was
definitely something you have to get used to.

854
01:16:43,128 --> 01:16:48,091
But I wanted to,
I wanted him to be in my life.

855
01:16:50,594 --> 01:16:53,555
We will not lose someone like him.

856
01:16:55,557 --> 01:17:00,020
I would not want to lose a guy like him.

857
01:17:28,715 --> 01:17:32,803
Not know what would happen if you lose or not.

858
01:17:32,886 --> 01:17:36,515
- After surgery, was accompanied by the bed

859
01:17:36,598 --> 01:17:40,769
- When he opened his eyes, in his stupor, was looking for someone
more

860
01:17:40,852 --> 01:17:45,232
It was really...

861
01:17:50,612 --> 01:17:54,032
I was very sorry for him because the only one who was there was I

862
01:17:54,116 --> 01:17:58,745
- His assistant paid.

863
01:17:58,829 --> 01:18:03,291
You expect to go through a experiemcia
and the person next to you is

864
01:18:03,375 --> 01:18:08,797
... Your life partner.
But I was.

865
01:18:08,880 --> 01:18:12,926
He must have felt so alone.

866
01:18:21,810 --> 01:18:24,813
His recovery was miraculous.

867
01:18:24,896 --> 01:18:31,987
He took the time to deepen
yourself and heal.

868
01:18:35,324 --> 01:18:38,327
I've spent my life doing
famous people.

869
01:18:38,410 --> 01:18:43,874
But I've never seen in unhealthy fame.

870
01:18:43,957 --> 01:18:49,421
Survive it is difficult
and has no value in itself.

871
01:18:51,340 --> 01:18:55,594
I love what I did, I would not change what I've done in my life
-

872
01:18:55,677 --> 01:19:02,100
- but should have been less
artists and achieved greater intimacy.

873
01:19:02,184 --> 01:19:06,438
I was lucky to find a family
later in life

874
01:19:06,521 --> 01:19:10,025
- But not developed a family.

875
01:19:10,108 --> 01:19:16,740
I was part of the family life of Alice,
but I had my own, I had no time.

876
01:19:22,621 --> 01:19:28,126
I'll say it again, I do not think it's coincidence:
First was the healthy food and then blew his ass.

877
01:19:29,044 --> 01:19:34,091
- Shep's friends are her real family.
- Is more than a friend, like a brother.

878
01:19:34,174 --> 01:19:37,427
I have told Shep -

879
01:19:37,511 --> 01:19:42,265
- Things I have not told anyone.
Not even my wife.

880
01:19:42,683 --> 01:19:49,022
I would give him a big kiss on the mouth, is a great guy

881
01:19:53,694 --> 01:19:57,531
His laughter is legendary, as choking

882
01:19:57,614 --> 01:20:00,909
When laughs barking like a seal.

883
01:20:09,876 --> 01:20:13,755
Shep is the nicest person I've ever met.

884
01:20:13,839 --> 01:20:17,843
I've never heard him say anything unkind about
anyone.

885
01:20:17,926 --> 01:20:22,764
But he is not...
What is the word? Boring.

886
01:20:22,973 --> 01:20:27,436
- She loves to make people happy.
- He taught me to be grateful.

887
01:20:27,519 --> 01:20:33,859
And not to complain so much, when in fact
're damn lucky.

888
01:20:37,863 --> 01:20:42,326
've Always wanted a baby.
But I have not given up.

889
01:20:42,409 --> 01:20:45,787
Perhaps still a little inside me.
