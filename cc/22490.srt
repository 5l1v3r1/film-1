1
00:03:31,493 --> 00:03:36,362
Did that bad monster try to fight
with Muddy's little baby? My darling.

2
00:03:36,765 --> 00:03:40,792
You sure are nice and sweet,
but you need perfume on your breath.

3
00:03:41,036 --> 00:03:42,867
- Good morning, Olive.
- Good morning.

4
00:03:42,971 --> 00:03:46,202
Good grief. Women should leave
beasts like that at home.

5
00:03:46,275 --> 00:03:49,767
But my little Lillikins is different.
She's her Muddy's little playmate.

6
00:03:49,845 --> 00:03:51,972
Olive, here's her special drinking water.

7
00:03:52,047 --> 00:03:53,981
She never wants to drink, Mrs. Van Adams.

8
00:03:54,049 --> 00:03:58,076
You never can tell. Some day, she may.
If she cries for me, tell her that...

9
00:03:58,153 --> 00:04:01,850
...Muddy's making herself beautiful
just to play with little Lillikins.

10
00:04:01,924 --> 00:04:04,415
Mrs. Carter and I are being done together.
Is she here?

11
00:04:04,493 --> 00:04:08,122
Yes. You're going to have a manicure,
shampoo, facial and everything.

12
00:04:08,797 --> 00:04:12,198
- Look at Sydney's miniatures.
- Sure sign of a petty mind.

13
00:04:12,267 --> 00:04:15,703
They've been waiting half an hour.
You could see the art exhibit later.

14
00:04:15,771 --> 00:04:17,739
All right. Art exhibit, my foot.

15
00:04:17,806 --> 00:04:20,331
Would you remove your hat?
Sit here, Mrs. Spencer.

16
00:04:20,409 --> 00:04:21,740
How fascinating.

17
00:04:21,810 --> 00:04:25,109
- Put your face in there and be quiet.
- Let me see!

18
00:04:25,747 --> 00:04:30,582
I hate to tell you dear, but your skin
makes the Rockies look like chiffon velvet.

19
00:04:33,789 --> 00:04:37,418
Only half a minute more, Mrs. Miller,
and you can talk again.

20
00:04:37,492 --> 00:04:39,824
I beg your pardon.
I'm looking for Grandma.

21
00:04:39,895 --> 00:04:42,659
- Grandma isn't in there.
- She isn't in here.

22
00:04:42,731 --> 00:04:46,758
This mud has worms in it!
I know it has worms in it! I can feel them.

23
00:04:46,835 --> 00:04:49,065
They're more scared of you
than you are of them.

24
00:04:49,137 --> 00:04:52,038
What's a little worm?
At Harvard and Yale, they eat them.

25
00:04:52,107 --> 00:04:56,009
- Relax. Rest and close your eyes.
- All right.

26
00:04:56,345 --> 00:05:00,338
But I still say I'm going to pull a gun
on him, just like I did on Judge McClure.

27
00:05:00,415 --> 00:05:03,612
I'm coming. My dears!

28
00:05:03,752 --> 00:05:06,744
That solid mountain of flesh
is going to marry a jockey.

29
00:05:06,989 --> 00:05:11,085
- Won't her husband turn over in his grave?
- What's she got in common with a jockey?

30
00:05:11,159 --> 00:05:12,285
Horse feathers.

31
00:05:13,662 --> 00:05:14,686
Yes, miss?

32
00:05:14,763 --> 00:05:18,028
She's all right, Miss Spencer.
She's my press agent.

33
00:05:18,133 --> 00:05:22,092
Has anybody seen my grandmother?
She's Southern. Thank you.

34
00:05:22,204 --> 00:05:24,195
The South is in that direction.

35
00:05:26,975 --> 00:05:29,000
- Grandma!
- Hello, darling.

36
00:05:29,077 --> 00:05:31,102
- Where have you been?
- Four miles.

37
00:05:31,179 --> 00:05:34,273
- May I go to the fights tonight?
- Not without me.

38
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:37,309
Is Miss Atkinson here?

39
00:05:44,059 --> 00:05:46,186
You don't look a day over 35.

40
00:05:46,261 --> 00:05:48,752
That old gasoline truck.
She's 60 if she's a minute.

41
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:50,354
- Who is she?
- Gillingswater.

42
00:05:50,432 --> 00:05:52,662
One more permanent
and she won't have a hair left.

43
00:05:52,734 --> 00:05:55,567
- She's got a lot on her arms.
- She does shed, doesn't she?

44
00:05:56,438 --> 00:05:57,370
It's the newest color, Jungle Red.

45
00:05:57,439 --> 00:05:59,771
- What?
- It's the newest color, Jungle Red.

46
00:05:59,841 --> 00:06:03,436
One of the girls recognized his name
from Cholly Knickerbocker's column...

47
00:06:03,512 --> 00:06:04,501
...and it was Haines.

48
00:06:04,579 --> 00:06:06,308
- What did you say the name was?
- Haines.

49
00:06:06,715 --> 00:06:08,080
How do you know?

50
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:10,414
Two weeks ago I passed by
where Crystal lives.

51
00:06:10,485 --> 00:06:13,682
The landlady said she'd moved
to be with her gentleman friend.

52
00:06:13,755 --> 00:06:17,282
- ''What gentleman <i>friend,''</i> I said...
- Shut it off. I can't hear a thing!

53
00:06:17,359 --> 00:06:19,987
Hazel! Hurry, get the pins out.
I want to get out!

54
00:06:25,534 --> 00:06:28,992
- Boo! I'm an elevator man!
- Don't frighten Mother, dear.

55
00:06:29,271 --> 00:06:31,000
Run along, darlings.

56
00:06:32,407 --> 00:06:35,899
The lambs! Are you sure they are dressed
warm enough? Hello?

57
00:06:36,178 --> 00:06:40,512
Edith? Take a good grip on yourself.
You're going to die.

58
00:06:41,349 --> 00:06:43,647
Stephen Haines is stepping out on Mary.

59
00:06:44,486 --> 00:06:48,115
- What?
- All aboard for the main lobby.

60
00:06:49,291 --> 00:06:51,316
Yes. Run along now, children.

61
00:06:51,927 --> 00:06:54,327
But, Sylvia darling, who told you?

62
00:06:54,963 --> 00:06:59,332
A manicurist? Go on.

63
00:06:59,501 --> 00:07:02,231
This manicurist,
she's perfectly divine, she said to me:

64
00:07:02,304 --> 00:07:04,272
<i>''I</i> know something about
rich Mrs. <i>Haines.''</i>

65
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:12,980
But, Sylvia, suppose Mary should
hear about it? Wouldn't it be terrible?

66
00:07:13,081 --> 00:07:14,673
Wouldn't it be ghastly?

67
00:07:15,283 --> 00:07:18,150
But, darling,
we've got to face her at lunch today.

68
00:07:18,453 --> 00:07:20,887
Won't it be too tragic?

69
00:07:21,189 --> 00:07:23,657
Eating her food
and knowing all about her husband!

70
00:07:23,892 --> 00:07:28,022
Darling, I'll burst until I get the details,
but I've got to see that filthy doctor.

71
00:07:28,096 --> 00:07:32,157
Yes, you know, my regular checkup.
Goodbye, darling.

72
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:41,801
Operator, will you give me
Great Neck 8125, please.

73
00:07:42,477 --> 00:07:45,913
Will you tone her down? This is a toll call.

74
00:07:46,715 --> 00:07:49,707
Hello, this is Mrs. Potter speaking.

75
00:07:49,818 --> 00:07:52,878
Will you tell Mrs. Haines
not to wait lunch for me?

76
00:07:52,954 --> 00:07:57,391
No, tell her I have to see my doctor,
but I'll make it just as soon as I can.

77
00:07:57,893 --> 00:08:01,351
Mrs. Haines is out riding now
with Little Mary, but I'll let her know.

78
00:08:08,770 --> 00:08:10,635
Mother, will you tell Daddy I beat you.
Will you tell him?

79
00:08:10,705 --> 00:08:14,607
- lf I tell him, he'll think I'm conceited.
- He'll be awfully disappointed in me.

80
00:08:14,676 --> 00:08:19,238
- But you're so solid with him anyway.
- You think so! All right, I'll tell him.

81
00:08:19,814 --> 00:08:23,079
And to prove it beyond doubt,
I'll photograph the finish!

82
00:08:23,151 --> 00:08:24,277
Swell!

83
00:08:28,356 --> 00:08:31,382
Lickety-split now!
It's got to look like the real McCoy.

84
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:33,924
All right, Mother. Here I come.

85
00:08:41,002 --> 00:08:42,401
The winner!

86
00:08:43,305 --> 00:08:47,401
- I'll have to borrow your horse next time.
- I could beat you with any horse.

87
00:08:47,475 --> 00:08:49,705
Let me take you now, Mother.

88
00:08:49,778 --> 00:08:52,770
Wait a minute. Look at that one.

89
00:08:55,383 --> 00:08:56,315
How's that?

90
00:08:56,384 --> 00:08:58,477
Look out there.
You're shooting us on the bias.

91
00:08:58,553 --> 00:09:00,919
I meant to. That's artistic.

92
00:09:01,156 --> 00:09:04,455
That won't impress Daddy.
He's heard that one before.

93
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:08,026
- How is this for artistic?
- That's swell.

94
00:09:08,096 --> 00:09:09,586
Hold it. Still.

95
00:09:14,869 --> 00:09:16,803
My goodness! What a racket.

96
00:09:16,871 --> 00:09:19,499
If this was an angel cake,
it would fall like a board.

97
00:09:19,574 --> 00:09:22,008
Any great ideas about
dessert tonight, Ingrid?

98
00:09:22,077 --> 00:09:24,637
- Baked apples.
- What? No charlotte russe?

99
00:09:24,713 --> 00:09:27,546
- You never eat it, and he shouldn't.
- Why?

100
00:09:27,616 --> 00:09:31,108
Because he sits in an office all day,
and most every night too, lately.

101
00:09:31,186 --> 00:09:34,417
That's why he should be pampered.
It's our last dinner at home.

102
00:09:34,489 --> 00:09:37,322
We'll be up in Canada for two weeks,
living like pioneers.

103
00:09:37,392 --> 00:09:39,553
I'll be cooking, so you know what he'll get.

104
00:09:39,628 --> 00:09:41,459
I know. Indigestion.

105
00:09:42,397 --> 00:09:47,300
You can't fool me. You cook for him
like a French chef all the time you're away.

106
00:09:47,502 --> 00:09:51,939
I was looking for my cookbook
this morning, and I found it in your trunk.

107
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,367
- I'll bring it back.
- I hope.

108
00:09:54,509 --> 00:09:57,444
What kind of food
do you want for him tonight?

109
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:01,807
- Pancakes Barbara.
- Ridiculous. 20 pounds right off.

110
00:10:01,883 --> 00:10:05,046
- Come on.
- All right, if you say so.

111
00:10:05,387 --> 00:10:09,983
But that adonis figure of his won't last
forever without help from the kitchen.

112
00:10:24,773 --> 00:10:28,436
- Mother, I'm helping you to pack.
- Thanks, darling.

113
00:10:28,510 --> 00:10:31,411
Sheba, get off Daddy's coat.

114
00:10:34,449 --> 00:10:37,850
You don't want to take this old thing
along with Daddy, do you?

115
00:10:37,919 --> 00:10:40,046
- What old thing, dear?
- This.

116
00:10:40,789 --> 00:10:45,385
Old thing? What do you mean, old thing?

117
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:48,156
- Daddy never wears that coat.
- Yes, he does.

118
00:10:48,229 --> 00:10:52,029
Whenever we go away on trips together,
hunting and fishing.

119
00:10:52,634 --> 00:10:55,296
- Where did you get those?
- I found them in here.

120
00:11:00,508 --> 00:11:04,877
- We took those on our honeymoon.
- You did? Where was your honeymoon?

121
00:11:04,946 --> 00:11:07,779
Up in Canada,
where we're going tomorrow.

122
00:11:12,754 --> 00:11:16,087
You know, that's the spot
where I caught that famous fish.

123
00:11:16,157 --> 00:11:21,026
Goodness gracious! It isn't such a big fish,
though, is it, Mother?

124
00:11:21,663 --> 00:11:25,326
The big fish aren't always
the most important, you know.

125
00:11:26,368 --> 00:11:29,166
When I first married Daddy,
I couldn't fish worth a cent.

126
00:11:29,237 --> 00:11:30,704
He started to teach me.

127
00:11:30,772 --> 00:11:35,072
The first thing I learned was how
to cast a fly. And then I caught that fish!

128
00:11:35,143 --> 00:11:37,543
And Daddy said
he'd have to have it stuffed...

129
00:11:37,612 --> 00:11:40,945
...in case I never catch another.

130
00:11:42,183 --> 00:11:45,050
- But you do catch others?
- Millions of them.

131
00:11:45,286 --> 00:11:48,619
It's only nip and tuck now who makes
the biggest catch, Daddy or me.

132
00:11:48,690 --> 00:11:51,887
- Does it make Daddy jealous?
- Furious. We have terrific battles.

133
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:53,587
Now you're just fooling.

134
00:11:54,028 --> 00:11:57,122
- Where's Daddy in this one?
- He's probably taking the picture.

135
00:11:57,198 --> 00:12:00,998
- I see his shadow, there in the snow.
- That's right.

136
00:12:02,904 --> 00:12:04,565
I remember that morning.

137
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:08,939
It snowed during the night and we had to
dig our way out of the cabin.

138
00:12:10,145 --> 00:12:12,443
We were snowbound for two whole days.

139
00:12:12,514 --> 00:12:15,074
- Like in a movie?
- Yes, darling.

140
00:12:15,417 --> 00:12:17,510
Were your lives in danger?

141
00:12:21,022 --> 00:12:24,753
Hardly. But it was very romantic, anyway.

142
00:12:26,394 --> 00:12:29,090
I think that kind
of lovey-dovey stuff is silly.

143
00:12:29,164 --> 00:12:32,463
You do?
What do you know about it, anyway?

144
00:12:33,868 --> 00:12:35,335
Mother?

145
00:12:35,403 --> 00:12:38,861
What do you and Daddy talk about
when I'm not around?

146
00:12:40,074 --> 00:12:44,204
- I don't know. Everything.
- You do an awful lot of laughing.

147
00:12:44,379 --> 00:12:46,370
- Do we?
- I hear you sometimes.

148
00:12:46,448 --> 00:12:49,008
- You shouldn't be listening.
- What do you laugh at?

149
00:12:50,018 --> 00:12:52,418
Little jokes. Lots of things.

150
00:12:52,487 --> 00:12:55,456
- Do you love Daddy better than me?
- What?

151
00:12:56,157 --> 00:12:58,352
Whatever gave you such an idea?

152
00:12:58,426 --> 00:13:01,395
Ingrid says you love him
better than anyone.

153
00:13:01,696 --> 00:13:05,792
That's a different kind of love.
You'll find out when you grow up.

154
00:13:06,334 --> 00:13:07,631
Will I?

155
00:13:07,702 --> 00:13:11,536
When I do,
I hope that I won't think it's silly.

156
00:13:13,541 --> 00:13:16,009
The lunch guests have started to arrive.

157
00:13:16,077 --> 00:13:18,068
Let me pick out your dress.

158
00:13:18,146 --> 00:13:20,706
- They'll be fancy, why not be plain?
- Let's hurry.

159
00:13:21,416 --> 00:13:23,543
- How do you do, Mrs. Potter?
- Hello, Jane.

160
00:13:23,618 --> 00:13:25,552
- How are you feeling today?
- Too awful.

161
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:28,384
I wouldn't wish my woes
on my worst friend.

162
00:13:29,724 --> 00:13:31,692
Will you tell Mrs. Fowler
that I'd like to talk to her for a moment?

163
00:13:33,061 --> 00:13:34,221
Yes, Mrs. Potter.

164
00:13:34,529 --> 00:13:37,930
- How's the little mother?
- Jane, never mind about that.

165
00:13:38,066 --> 00:13:39,192
Hello, dear.

166
00:13:39,367 --> 00:13:41,562
The spider's in the parlor. Let's join her.

167
00:13:41,636 --> 00:13:44,366
I said, ''Do you expect me to stay home
and darn your socks?

168
00:13:44,439 --> 00:13:47,875
- ''Why do we keep servants? <i>''</i>
- You don't keep them long.

169
00:13:48,076 --> 00:13:51,136
Great guns, what are you made up for?
''The Seeing <i>Eye''?</i>

170
00:13:51,212 --> 00:13:53,578
You better save your cracks
for your next book.

171
00:13:53,648 --> 00:13:57,277
- Edith, you must have dashed.
- I broke every speed record.

172
00:14:00,021 --> 00:14:03,047
- Weren't you going to Africa to shoot?
- As soon as my book's out.

173
00:14:03,124 --> 00:14:07,458
I'd rather face a tiger than the things
the critics said about your last book.

174
00:14:07,795 --> 00:14:11,390
- Isn't this divine of Mary and the little girl?
- Let's see.

175
00:14:11,533 --> 00:14:13,228
What does it say?

176
00:14:13,468 --> 00:14:16,494
Leave it to Mary to see
she's photographed from her best angle.

177
00:14:16,571 --> 00:14:17,560
Is that so?

178
00:14:17,639 --> 00:14:19,800
What will you write next? Animal stories?

179
00:14:19,874 --> 00:14:22,502
I wouldn't have to go to Africa for that.

180
00:14:22,577 --> 00:14:25,410
I wish I could make a little money writing,
the way you do.

181
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:27,778
If you wrote the way I do,
that's what you'd make.

182
00:14:27,882 --> 00:14:30,851
- You're not a very popular author, are you?
- Not with you.

183
00:14:30,919 --> 00:14:33,444
Best angle, my foot.
It doesn't half do her justice.

184
00:14:33,521 --> 00:14:34,920
You'll have some sherry?

185
00:14:34,989 --> 00:14:37,685
I'll take it. Peggy never seems
to connect very well.

186
00:14:37,759 --> 00:14:39,090
- I'm sorry.
- Let me see.

187
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:42,960
She's in love, bless her. After the child's
been married as long as you...

188
00:14:43,031 --> 00:14:45,932
...she may be able to concentrate
on matters like cocktails.

189
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,094
- Another lecture on the modern woman.
- At the drop of a hat.

190
00:14:49,170 --> 00:14:53,129
I consider myself a perfectly good wife.
I've sacrificed a lot for Howard Fowler.

191
00:14:53,207 --> 00:14:54,299
Smoked oysters.

192
00:14:54,375 --> 00:14:56,969
Don't mention smoked oysters.
They turn me green.

193
00:14:57,045 --> 00:14:58,410
You are a bore.

194
00:14:58,479 --> 00:15:00,845
Lay off my reputation, girls,
while I unswallow.

195
00:15:00,915 --> 00:15:01,904
Please.

196
00:15:04,319 --> 00:15:07,777
- Isn't Little Mary a dream?
- I wish I could afford to have a baby.

197
00:15:07,855 --> 00:15:10,756
You never will
if your bridge game doesn't improve.

198
00:15:10,825 --> 00:15:13,350
I'm devoted to Edith Potter,
but she gets me down.

199
00:15:13,428 --> 00:15:15,726
I don't blame her husband
for being bored with her.

200
00:15:15,797 --> 00:15:19,597
- What makes you think Mr. Potter is...
- My dear, he's one of those flirty types.

201
00:15:19,667 --> 00:15:22,465
Loves to kiss all the girls.
I told him off one time.

202
00:15:22,537 --> 00:15:25,973
I said, ''Look, one more smack,
and I'll go straight to Edith! <i>''</i>

203
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:28,531
- Did you?
- Of course not.

204
00:15:28,610 --> 00:15:30,407
I'd die before I'd hurt Edith.

205
00:15:30,478 --> 00:15:33,379
- Nuts.
- Thanks, dear.

206
00:15:34,182 --> 00:15:38,118
Heaven be praised, I'm on to my husband.
I wouldn't trust him on Alcatraz.

207
00:15:38,186 --> 00:15:41,781
You oughtn't to talk about him like that.
I think it's disloyal.

208
00:15:41,856 --> 00:15:45,087
Do we know how the men talk
about us when we're not around?

209
00:15:45,159 --> 00:15:47,286
- I've heard rumors.
- Exactly.

210
00:15:48,496 --> 00:15:49,986
While we're on the subject...

211
00:15:50,064 --> 00:15:53,830
...have you wondered if the master
of this <i>maison</i> might not be straying?

212
00:15:53,901 --> 00:15:55,163
I haven't.

213
00:15:55,436 --> 00:15:58,530
Mary Haines may be living
in a fool's paradise.

214
00:15:58,606 --> 00:16:01,632
You're so resourceful.
I ought to go to you for plots.

215
00:16:01,709 --> 00:16:03,199
You ought to go to someone.

216
00:16:03,277 --> 00:16:07,737
- All over, dear?
- False alarm. Have you finished with me?

217
00:16:07,815 --> 00:16:09,510
Long ago. We're on our hostess.

218
00:16:09,584 --> 00:16:13,577
I think Mary's being very wise,
snatching Stephen Haines off to Canada.

219
00:16:13,655 --> 00:16:16,886
You just can't bear Mary's happiness,
can you? It gets you down.

220
00:16:16,958 --> 00:16:21,292
- How ridiculous. Why should it?
- She's contented to be what she is.

221
00:16:21,362 --> 00:16:23,125
- Which is what?
- A woman.

222
00:16:23,197 --> 00:16:25,461
- And what are we?
- Females.

223
00:16:25,533 --> 00:16:27,831
Really? And what are you, pet?

224
00:16:28,002 --> 00:16:31,631
What nature abhors.
An old maid. A frozen asset.

225
00:16:32,206 --> 00:16:36,040
- Come on. Let's see what's keeping Mary.
- Run along, children.

226
00:16:37,311 --> 00:16:41,111
I thought I'd never get you alone.
I can't wait to get the lowdown.

227
00:16:41,182 --> 00:16:44,948
You're going to swoon when I tell you.
You know I go to Sydney's for my hair.

228
00:16:45,019 --> 00:16:47,487
You should go, pet.
I despise whoever does yours.

229
00:16:47,555 --> 00:16:49,785
I know it looks awful.
Never mind. Hurry up.

230
00:16:49,857 --> 00:16:52,985
This manicurist, Olga, is a riot.
Isn't that divine? Jungle Red.

231
00:16:53,061 --> 00:16:54,494
Simply divine. Go on.

232
00:16:54,562 --> 00:16:56,757
I was looking at <i>Vogue,</i>
the one with Mary in it.

233
00:16:56,831 --> 00:16:59,163
The one with the wig
that flatters her so much?

234
00:16:59,233 --> 00:17:02,293
That started this girl on Mary,
and the whole story rolled out.

235
00:17:02,370 --> 00:17:05,601
- Is it someone we know?
- No. That's what's so awful about it.

236
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:09,276
- She sells perfume at Black's Fifth Avenue.
- Black's?

237
00:17:11,446 --> 00:17:15,007
It wouldn't be so bad if he'd picked
someone of his class. But a beezle!

238
00:17:15,083 --> 00:17:17,210
How did he meet a girl like that?

239
00:17:17,285 --> 00:17:20,118
How do men ever meet girls like that?
They live for that.

240
00:17:20,188 --> 00:17:22,383
Somebody should shut that manicurist up.

241
00:17:22,457 --> 00:17:24,652
A piece of scandal like that? Not a chance.

242
00:17:24,726 --> 00:17:27,593
She never stops talking.
You know how those creatures are.

243
00:17:27,662 --> 00:17:30,187
Never let up.
A lot they care whose lives they ruin.

244
00:17:30,264 --> 00:17:33,199
10 cents! It's fine to be homespun
in the country, but really.

245
00:17:33,267 --> 00:17:35,394
- Isn't it a dirty trick?
- Isn't it foul?

246
00:17:35,470 --> 00:17:38,200
Cheap Chinese embroidery.
I'll bet Peggy gave her these.

247
00:17:38,272 --> 00:17:41,605
It wouldn't be so bad if only we knew.
We could keep our mouths shut.

248
00:17:41,676 --> 00:17:44,509
I know plenty I'd never breathe
about my friends' husbands.

249
00:17:44,579 --> 00:17:46,069
So do I.

250
00:17:48,416 --> 00:17:50,816
- You know I adore Mary.
- I worship her.

251
00:17:51,819 --> 00:17:53,150
We're not only cousins.
She's my best friend.

252
00:17:53,221 --> 00:17:55,883
We were raised together.
I forgot to tell <i>you...</i>

253
00:17:55,957 --> 00:17:58,118
- Break it up, girls.
- Darling!

254
00:17:58,192 --> 00:18:01,787
- Hello!
- You're so slim, I could kill you.

255
00:18:02,730 --> 00:18:04,595
You don't have to.
The diet I'm on is pure poison.

256
00:18:04,665 --> 00:18:07,327
How can you exercise all day,
and look so contented?

257
00:18:07,401 --> 00:18:09,369
It's a trick I learned from the cows.

258
00:18:09,437 --> 00:18:12,304
- Sorry to be late, girls.
- We haven't had a dull moment.

259
00:18:12,373 --> 00:18:14,432
Sylvia, feeling better?

260
00:18:14,675 --> 00:18:15,699
Meaning what?

261
00:18:15,777 --> 00:18:18,610
You and Edith look so relaxed.
It must have been choice.

262
00:18:18,679 --> 00:18:19,668
It was.

263
00:18:19,747 --> 00:18:24,548
- What are you talking about?
- Nothing. How's Stevie?

264
00:18:24,619 --> 00:18:27,053
Not so well lately.

265
00:18:27,288 --> 00:18:29,688
- What's the trouble?
- Jumpy nerves, I guess.

266
00:18:29,757 --> 00:18:32,123
Phelps has had nervous indigestion
for years.

267
00:18:32,193 --> 00:18:35,321
You should hear him rumble.
Like a truck on cobblestones.

268
00:18:35,396 --> 00:18:37,660
- Lunch is served.
- Thanks, Jane.

269
00:18:37,732 --> 00:18:40,667
- There's nothing worrying Steve, is there?
- I don't think so.

270
00:18:40,735 --> 00:18:43,636
He's been working too late
the last few weeks, that's all.

271
00:18:44,005 --> 00:18:47,805
Are you sure it's work, darling,
and not a beautiful blonde?

272
00:18:48,075 --> 00:18:51,044
Come on, Sylvia. Let's feed. I'm famished.

273
00:18:51,112 --> 00:18:54,343
- Stephen's a very attractive man.
- Isn't he?

274
00:18:54,415 --> 00:18:57,976
I can't imagine why he hasn't deserted me
for some glamour girl long ago.

275
00:18:58,052 --> 00:18:59,610
Don't be too sure of Methuselah.

276
00:18:59,687 --> 00:19:02,952
I tell Howard, ''lf you manage to make
a fool of me, I'll deserve <i>it.''</i>

277
00:19:03,024 --> 00:19:06,721
- You certainly will.
- Mr. Haines is on the phone.

278
00:19:06,961 --> 00:19:09,589
He probably can't get home to dinner.

279
00:19:09,797 --> 00:19:12,732
''Please don't talk about me
when I'm <i>gone''</i>

280
00:19:18,439 --> 00:19:19,963
Hello, dear.

281
00:19:21,976 --> 00:19:25,673
Stephen! What a bore!

282
00:19:28,916 --> 00:19:31,180
Yes, I'm nearly packed, but...

283
00:19:34,055 --> 00:19:35,886
...I can unpack again.

284
00:19:37,625 --> 00:19:38,922
I know.

285
00:19:40,328 --> 00:19:41,818
I know, darling.

286
00:19:42,163 --> 00:19:46,759
And don't you be too disappointed, either.
It'll be just as nice later on.

287
00:19:46,834 --> 00:19:49,098
Maybe you can make
an early train out tonight.

288
00:19:49,170 --> 00:19:51,695
I'll meet you at the station <i>and...</i>

289
00:19:55,543 --> 00:19:56,908
I see.

290
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:01,177
I'm sorry, darling.

291
00:20:02,817 --> 00:20:07,186
It's just that Ingrid was going
to outdo herself for you tonight.

292
00:20:10,291 --> 00:20:13,283
All right, sweet. Call me a little later.

293
00:20:14,295 --> 00:20:15,785
Goodbye, dear.

294
00:20:27,608 --> 00:20:30,168
You look as low as a swamp, dear.
What's up?

295
00:20:30,244 --> 00:20:34,374
It's really too disgusting. Stephen can't
get away to go to Canada tomorrow.

296
00:20:34,448 --> 00:20:35,506
He can't?

297
00:20:35,583 --> 00:20:38,381
If the trip's off,
I'll move into town in the morning.

298
00:20:38,452 --> 00:20:40,750
I would if I were you, Mary.

299
00:20:41,389 --> 00:20:44,790
Watercress. I'd just as soon
eat my way across a front lawn.

300
00:20:44,859 --> 00:20:48,351
Sylvia, what did you mean when you said
''Mary was in a fool's <i>paradise''?</i>

301
00:20:48,429 --> 00:20:51,523
She was trying to make a wisecrack
about marriage.

302
00:20:51,599 --> 00:20:55,262
She said, <i>''A</i> woman's paradise
is always a fool's <i>paradise.''</i>

303
00:20:55,336 --> 00:20:59,397
That's not bad, is it, Nancy?
Sylvia, whatever I'm living in, I like it.

304
00:20:59,473 --> 00:21:03,136
- No, thank you.
- Go ahead, dear. No starch. It's gluten.

305
00:21:03,244 --> 00:21:05,872
Did you ever know such a housewife?

306
00:21:05,947 --> 00:21:09,713
- Mary, how do you like that?
- Too adorable.

307
00:21:09,784 --> 00:21:13,413
You have no idea how it stays on.
I get it at Sydney's. You should go.

308
00:21:13,854 --> 00:21:16,584
A wonderful new manicurist. Olga.
She's marvelous.

309
00:21:16,757 --> 00:21:21,091
- Isn't that divine? Jungle Red.
- Looks as if you've torn someone's throat.

310
00:21:21,162 --> 00:21:23,687
I'll be darned
if I'll let you ride me anymore.

311
00:21:23,764 --> 00:21:25,595
Nancy is only trying to be clever.

312
00:21:25,666 --> 00:21:28,134
She picks on everything about me.
Even my nails.

313
00:21:28,202 --> 00:21:32,696
I like them. I really do. Sydney's,
Olga, Jungle Red. I'll remember.

314
00:21:35,409 --> 00:21:40,005
I woke up this morning and decided,
for no reason, to have myself overhauled.

315
00:21:40,881 --> 00:21:44,339
But why, darling?
Stephen adores you just as you are.

316
00:21:46,487 --> 00:21:49,149
Why do you think I'm getting
overhauled for Stephen?

317
00:21:49,223 --> 00:21:52,488
- You are, aren't you?
- Of course.

318
00:21:52,927 --> 00:21:55,555
I called for an appointment.
I'm Mrs. Fowler's friend.

319
00:21:55,629 --> 00:21:58,291
- Anyone in particular?
- Who does Mrs. Fowler's nails?

320
00:21:58,366 --> 00:21:59,958
Olga. I'll see if she's free.

321
00:22:00,034 --> 00:22:02,195
My Johnny doesn't like
Sylvia's Jungle Red.

322
00:22:02,269 --> 00:22:05,864
He said he'd like to do her nails right down
to the wrist with a buzz saw.

323
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:09,432
He's intolerant.
Sylvia is all right, underneath.

324
00:22:09,910 --> 00:22:12,879
Summer Rain.
This is the most divine new perfume.

325
00:22:13,314 --> 00:22:16,545
Yes, I have some.
Stephen gave me a bottle for my birthday.

326
00:22:16,751 --> 00:22:19,879
- I think Stephen's awfully sweet.
- Sweet?

327
00:22:20,321 --> 00:22:25,020
He gave you those gorgeous clips,
then he bothered to get you perfume, too.

328
00:22:25,092 --> 00:22:28,152
- Olga's ready, madam.
- Thank you. See you at the Ritz at 1:00.

329
00:22:28,229 --> 00:22:30,424
Take this with you.
It will keep you company.

330
00:22:30,498 --> 00:22:32,329
- Right up here, madam.
- 'Bye.

331
00:22:34,435 --> 00:22:36,562
Good morning, madam. Are you the one?

332
00:22:36,637 --> 00:22:40,232
I love to get a new client.
It puts a girl on her mettle.

333
00:22:40,408 --> 00:22:44,674
Don't you just love to read?
How do they think up those plots?

334
00:22:44,779 --> 00:22:49,375
Don't soak it yet. I suppose anybody's life
would be a plot if it had an exciting finish.

335
00:22:49,450 --> 00:22:51,975
- Who sent you in here?
- Mrs. Fowler.

336
00:22:52,153 --> 00:22:55,645
Isn't she a lamb?
She sent me three clients this week.

337
00:22:55,756 --> 00:22:56,745
Know Mrs. Parrish?

338
00:22:56,824 --> 00:23:00,590
She told me that Mr. Parrish came home
one night with lipstick on his collar.

339
00:23:00,661 --> 00:23:02,390
He always explained everything before.

340
00:23:02,463 --> 00:23:05,227
But that was something
he wasn't going to try to explain.

341
00:23:05,299 --> 00:23:07,267
Soak it, please. Know Mrs. Potter?

342
00:23:07,334 --> 00:23:10,132
I did her at her apartment.
It looks like a reform school.

343
00:23:10,204 --> 00:23:13,298
Her seven daughters are total gangsters.
Know Mrs. Stephen Haines?

344
00:23:13,374 --> 00:23:14,363
Why, yes. l...

345
00:23:14,442 --> 00:23:18,139
I guess Mrs. Fowler told you about that.
She feels awful sorry for her.

346
00:23:18,579 --> 00:23:19,910
I don't.

347
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:23,541
- You would if you knew this girl.
- What girl?

348
00:23:23,651 --> 00:23:25,278
Crystal Allen.

349
00:23:25,853 --> 00:23:28,321
Yes. You know,
the girl who hooked Mr. Haines.

350
00:23:28,389 --> 00:23:30,289
Don't you like the file?

351
00:23:30,357 --> 00:23:34,953
This Crystal Allen is a friend of mine.
She's a terrible mantrap. Soak it, please.

352
00:23:35,029 --> 00:23:38,988
She's behind the perfume counter
at Black's. So was I, before I got fired.

353
00:23:39,066 --> 00:23:41,398
Left. That's how she met him.

354
00:23:42,369 --> 00:23:43,768
Met Stephen Haines?

355
00:23:44,004 --> 00:23:47,064
It was a couple of months ago.
Us girls wasn't busy.

356
00:23:47,141 --> 00:23:48,938
It was an awful rainy day.

357
00:23:49,343 --> 00:23:52,801
This gentleman walks up to the counter.
Crystal nabs him.

358
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,643
<i>''I</i> want some <i>perfume,''</i> he says.

359
00:23:54,715 --> 00:23:57,149
''May I ask what type of woman for? <i>''</i>
Crystal says.

360
00:23:57,218 --> 00:24:01,154
That didn't mean a thing. She was going
to sell him Summer Rain, our feature.

361
00:24:01,222 --> 00:24:04,020
Crystal goes on conning him,
and batting her eyes.

362
00:24:04,358 --> 00:24:08,260
She's got those eyes that
run up and down a man like a searchlight.

363
00:24:08,329 --> 00:24:12,060
She puts perfume in her palm and in
the crook of her arm for him to smell.

364
00:24:12,133 --> 00:24:14,931
He got to smelling around,
and I guess he liked it.

365
00:24:15,002 --> 00:24:18,369
Since then, they've been inseparable,
practically every evening.

366
00:24:18,439 --> 00:24:22,136
Did I hurt? Jungle Red, I suppose?
One coat, or two?

367
00:24:24,478 --> 00:24:25,467
Never mind.

368
00:24:27,448 --> 00:24:31,145
But I thought that's what you came in for?
All of Mrs. Fowler's friends...

369
00:24:31,218 --> 00:24:34,278
I think I got
what all Mrs. Fowler's friends come for.

370
00:24:34,355 --> 00:24:38,223
Thanks. Goodbye.
I'll tell her you were in, <i>Mrs...</i>

371
00:24:38,993 --> 00:24:40,221
Mrs. Stephen Haines.

372
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:49,799
Mrs. Haines, I'm sorry.
Is there something I can do?

373
00:24:50,538 --> 00:24:53,473
- Just stop telling that story.
- Sure, I will.

374
00:24:54,775 --> 00:24:59,337
- Please don't tell anyone you told it to me.
- I won't. I promise.

375
00:24:59,747 --> 00:25:04,241
That would be kind of humiliating for you.
I mean, Crystal's a terrible girl.

376
00:25:04,318 --> 00:25:07,549
She's terribly clever and terribly pretty,
Mrs. Haines.

377
00:25:07,621 --> 00:25:11,352
If I was you, I wouldn't waste time
trying to get Mr. Haines away from her.

378
00:25:11,425 --> 00:25:14,155
I mean, now you know, Mrs. Haines.

379
00:25:21,502 --> 00:25:26,405
- Mrs. Haines, your mother is here.
- Thank you, Jane. Tell her I'll be right out.

380
00:25:26,473 --> 00:25:27,940
Yes, ma'am.

381
00:25:32,913 --> 00:25:34,437
- Hello, dear!
- Hello, Mother.

382
00:25:34,515 --> 00:25:37,780
What lovely <i>rubrum!</i>

383
00:25:37,851 --> 00:25:40,285
- What will you wear this evening?
- My old black.

384
00:25:40,354 --> 00:25:41,787
Yes, ma'am.

385
00:25:42,723 --> 00:25:45,817
- No, I think I'll wear my new pink.
- Very well.

386
00:25:49,330 --> 00:25:52,925
What's on your mind? You sounded
so excited on the telephone just now.

387
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:58,704
I think I was, my dear. Jungle Red.
I've been to Sydney's this afternoon, too.

388
00:26:01,775 --> 00:26:05,267
- Did you have Olga?
- No, but Olga knew who I was.

389
00:26:05,379 --> 00:26:10,180
She asked to meet me. She's very upset
about the story she blurted out to you.

390
00:26:11,085 --> 00:26:14,020
- She didn't say it wasn't true, did she?
- No.

391
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:23,623
I knew this sort of thing happened
to other people, but <i>I...</i>

392
00:26:23,697 --> 00:26:26,359
I never dreamed it could happen to us.

393
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:30,195
We've been so happy together.
So really happy.

394
00:26:30,404 --> 00:26:31,632
I know.

395
00:26:33,307 --> 00:26:34,706
There, there, baby.

396
00:26:40,914 --> 00:26:42,541
Have you got one?

397
00:26:49,290 --> 00:26:50,780
I'll be all right now.

398
00:26:50,858 --> 00:26:53,486
You haven't said anything
to Stephen yet, have you?

399
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:56,654
- No. I haven't even seen him since...
- Then say nothing.

400
00:26:56,730 --> 00:26:58,630
Don't forget that's my handkerchief.

401
00:26:58,699 --> 00:27:01,862
- Shall I give this a touch with the iron?
- Yes. Thank you, Jane.

402
00:27:01,935 --> 00:27:03,926
Look, Mother. Rather sweet, isn't it?

403
00:27:04,004 --> 00:27:06,973
Charming. And very wise of you
to wear pink.

404
00:27:10,878 --> 00:27:13,312
You didn't really mean
that I should say nothing?

405
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:15,712
- Of course I do.
- But, Mother...

406
00:27:15,783 --> 00:27:17,648
I felt the same way 20 years ago.

407
00:27:20,254 --> 00:27:21,653
Not Father!

408
00:27:23,791 --> 00:27:28,023
In many ways, your father was
an exceptional man, but that wasn't one.

409
00:27:28,395 --> 00:27:31,922
- And you said nothing?
- Nothing. I had a wise mother, too.

410
00:27:31,999 --> 00:27:35,628
Listen, my dear. This story isn't new.
It comes to most wives.

411
00:27:35,869 --> 00:27:37,166
But Stephen...

412
00:27:37,237 --> 00:27:40,502
Stephen is a man.
He's been married 10 years.

413
00:27:40,741 --> 00:27:42,470
You mean he's tired of me?

414
00:27:42,543 --> 00:27:46,445
Stephen's tired of himself,
tired of feeling the same things in himself.

415
00:27:46,513 --> 00:27:48,913
Time comes when a man
has to feel something new.

416
00:27:48,982 --> 00:27:52,418
And he's got to feel young again,
just because he's growing old.

417
00:27:52,486 --> 00:27:54,750
- Mother, Stephen isn't old.
- Of course not.

418
00:27:54,822 --> 00:27:56,790
But we women are much more sensible.

419
00:27:56,857 --> 00:28:00,725
When we tire of ourselves,
we change our hair, or hire a new cook...

420
00:28:00,794 --> 00:28:02,785
...or decorate the house.

421
00:28:02,930 --> 00:28:07,128
I suppose a man could do over his office,
but he never thinks of anything so simple.

422
00:28:07,301 --> 00:28:10,532
No, dear. A man has only one escape
from his old self.

423
00:28:10,604 --> 00:28:13,664
To see a different self
in the mirror of some woman's eyes.

424
00:28:15,008 --> 00:28:18,466
The girl probably means no more to him
than that new dress means to you.

425
00:28:18,545 --> 00:28:20,103
But, Mother...

426
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:24,740
He doesn't love the girl. If he did,
you'd have felt it yourself long ago.

427
00:28:27,488 --> 00:28:32,221
Yes, I always thought I would.
I love him so much.

428
00:28:32,393 --> 00:28:36,591
And he loves you, baby.
So take my advice. Keep still.

429
00:28:36,663 --> 00:28:39,632
Keep still when you're fairly aching to talk.

430
00:28:39,767 --> 00:28:44,261
It's about the only sacrifice spoiled women
like us ever have to make to keep our men.

431
00:28:44,338 --> 00:28:47,705
- What if I don't want him on those terms?
- But, Mary...

432
00:28:47,775 --> 00:28:51,108
Mother, it's all right for you
to talk of another generation...

433
00:28:51,178 --> 00:28:54,670
...when women were chattels,
and they did as men told them to.

434
00:28:54,748 --> 00:28:58,240
But this is today.
Stephen and I are equals.

435
00:28:58,852 --> 00:29:03,949
We took each other of our own free will,
for life, because we loved each other.

436
00:29:04,691 --> 00:29:08,991
We've always given each other our best.
I won't qualify that relationship now.

437
00:29:09,062 --> 00:29:11,087
It's wrong. Shockingly wrong!

438
00:29:11,165 --> 00:29:14,464
And women that stand for such things
are beneath contempt.

439
00:29:14,535 --> 00:29:16,366
I'll never be one of them! Never!

440
00:29:16,437 --> 00:29:19,372
- But, Mary...
- It's all over. It's finished. I'm through.

441
00:29:19,573 --> 00:29:22,440
No, it isn't. It will never be finished
while you love him.

442
00:29:22,776 --> 00:29:25,643
I'll get over that. Women do.
They have to.

443
00:29:27,881 --> 00:29:29,644
What are you doing this evening?

444
00:29:31,718 --> 00:29:33,982
We're dining at home
and going to the theater.

445
00:29:34,054 --> 00:29:38,286
I've asked Beth and Dave.
I'll go through with it.

446
00:29:39,259 --> 00:29:42,456
I'll have it out with him after.
I'll tell him that I can't go on.

447
00:29:42,529 --> 00:29:47,057
You're not to say a word to Stephen
until you've thought this out very calmly.

448
00:29:47,134 --> 00:29:49,864
I'm going this minute to get our tickets.

449
00:29:49,937 --> 00:29:52,167
You're taking me to Bermuda.
My throat's bad.

450
00:29:52,239 --> 00:29:55,367
I didn't want to worry you,
but my doctor says...

451
00:29:55,442 --> 00:29:57,205
How sweet of you.

452
00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:02,208
But what can there be between us now?

453
00:30:02,583 --> 00:30:05,984
The thing that made us
belong to each other is gone.

454
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:11,355
There's something more for you to think of
besides each other. There's your daughter.

455
00:30:15,496 --> 00:30:19,125
When Mary's old enough to realize,
she'll know I'm right.

456
00:30:19,366 --> 00:30:24,360
Have it your own way, but don't forget,
it's being together at the end that matters.

457
00:30:25,706 --> 00:30:29,904
One more piece of motherly advice.
Don't confide in your girlfriends.

458
00:30:30,878 --> 00:30:32,778
I think they all know.

459
00:30:32,846 --> 00:30:35,076
- Do they think you know?
- I don't know.

460
00:30:35,148 --> 00:30:36,445
Leave it that way.

461
00:30:36,517 --> 00:30:39,543
If you let them, they'll see that,
in the name of friendship...

462
00:30:39,620 --> 00:30:41,747
...you lose your husband and your home.

463
00:30:41,822 --> 00:30:45,383
I'm an old woman, my dear.
I know my sex. Goodbye.

464
00:30:48,128 --> 00:30:52,030
Goodbye, darling,
and thanks for coming up.

465
00:30:53,166 --> 00:30:55,657
It's nice to have you need Mother again.

466
00:30:55,736 --> 00:30:58,204
You'd better think it over, dear,
about Bermuda.

467
00:30:58,272 --> 00:31:02,572
Your home, Little Mary's home
is worth putting up a stiff battle for.

468
00:31:03,477 --> 00:31:05,707
There's nothing like a good dose
of being alone...

469
00:31:05,779 --> 00:31:07,940
...to make a man appreciate his wife.

470
00:31:08,015 --> 00:31:10,677
I think I better take my handkerchief.

471
00:31:23,764 --> 00:31:25,459
Hello, Stephen.

472
00:31:28,936 --> 00:31:30,028
Yes.

473
00:31:33,740 --> 00:31:35,367
You can't?

474
00:31:39,446 --> 00:31:40,845
I see.

475
00:31:42,983 --> 00:31:44,917
No, I'm not angry.

476
00:31:45,953 --> 00:31:49,912
Beth and Dave will be disappointed
not to see you, that's all.

477
00:31:51,925 --> 00:31:54,086
No, I won't wait up.

478
00:31:58,865 --> 00:32:02,392
I think I'll take Mother to Bermuda
for a few weeks.

479
00:32:02,636 --> 00:32:06,333
She was just here
and she doesn't seem to be feeling well.

480
00:32:08,275 --> 00:32:10,903
On the first boat, if you don't mind.

481
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:24,282
Don't break your appointment, dear,
if it's going to upset your business.

482
00:32:25,092 --> 00:32:28,858
But if you find that you can go tonight,
just call me back.

483
00:32:31,031 --> 00:32:35,195
You needn't dress, and it doesn't matter
if you're late for dinner.

484
00:32:36,637 --> 00:32:38,002
Goodbye.

485
00:32:56,256 --> 00:33:00,659
- Here we are. Creeping up on her.
- Do you think we ought to do this?

486
00:33:00,727 --> 00:33:01,921
Shut up.

487
00:33:05,766 --> 00:33:08,030
- That's little Crystal.
- None other.

488
00:33:09,670 --> 00:33:11,501
May I serve you, madam?

489
00:33:11,571 --> 00:33:14,062
- No, thank you.
- We're just looking.

490
00:33:14,207 --> 00:33:18,769
From the neck up, I'd say no.
How about Baby?

491
00:33:18,879 --> 00:33:20,210
Of course.

492
00:33:22,683 --> 00:33:24,150
It couldn't be anyone else.

493
00:33:24,217 --> 00:33:26,117
Pat, here's your customer's change.

494
00:33:26,186 --> 00:33:27,710
- Pat.
- May I wait on you?

495
00:33:27,788 --> 00:33:30,621
I still don't know why he overlooked her.

496
00:33:30,924 --> 00:33:32,653
I do. Pipe.

497
00:33:42,369 --> 00:33:44,963
Never mind. This has got to go out now.
Wrap it up.

498
00:33:45,038 --> 00:33:48,132
- Were you asking for me, Miss Allen?
- I've been looking for you.

499
00:33:48,208 --> 00:33:49,971
I want you to cook dinner.

500
00:33:50,043 --> 00:33:53,535
- I got a date tonight, Miss Crystal.
- You can break it. Come on.

501
00:33:53,613 --> 00:33:56,275
I'm noted for the bad way I cook.

502
00:33:56,349 --> 00:34:00,012
If you throw a lamb chop in a hot oven,
what will keep it from getting done?

503
00:34:00,087 --> 00:34:02,715
What happened to that hot date
you had for tonight?

504
00:34:02,789 --> 00:34:06,589
It's hotter than ever, dear.
I'm having him dine at my place.

505
00:34:06,660 --> 00:34:09,527
It's about time he found out
I was a home girl.

506
00:34:09,596 --> 00:34:13,464
Home girl? Get her. Why don't you
borrow the quintuplets for an evening?

507
00:34:13,533 --> 00:34:15,558
Because I'm all the baby he wants.

508
00:34:15,635 --> 00:34:18,001
- How much will you pay me?
- $2.

509
00:34:18,238 --> 00:34:20,536
- Can't you make it $3?
- I said $2.

510
00:34:20,607 --> 00:34:24,304
All right. Will I find anything
in your icebox?

511
00:34:24,377 --> 00:34:26,140
Cobwebs and a bottle of gin.

512
00:34:26,213 --> 00:34:28,807
Here's some dough.
Get anything, and make it fast.

513
00:34:28,882 --> 00:34:31,783
Perfume Department. It's for you, Crystal.

514
00:34:31,852 --> 00:34:34,946
It's too late to take any orders.
Tell them I've left the floor.

515
00:34:35,021 --> 00:34:39,481
- All right. I'll tell the gentleman.
- Gentleman? Why didn't you say so?

516
00:34:43,497 --> 00:34:45,488
Hello, Stephen.

517
00:34:47,434 --> 00:34:48,594
What?

518
00:34:50,203 --> 00:34:53,934
Don't worry, my sweet.

519
00:34:54,775 --> 00:34:57,903
Of course I don't mind
your breaking our engagement.

520
00:34:57,978 --> 00:35:02,278
That is, I mind, of course,
but it's such good discipline...

521
00:35:02,349 --> 00:35:04,442
...for my selfishness about you.

522
00:35:04,518 --> 00:35:07,544
- Holy mackerel! What a line!
- Shut up, will you?

523
00:35:09,589 --> 00:35:12,786
I was going to surprise you tonight...

524
00:35:12,859 --> 00:35:16,090
...and cook dinner myself
in my little apartment.

525
00:35:17,931 --> 00:35:20,024
Why, of course I can cook.

526
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:23,627
She thinks because Lulu's dark,
he won't be able to see her.

527
00:35:23,703 --> 00:35:26,638
You don't know half my accomplishments.

528
00:35:26,706 --> 00:35:29,834
- I'll say, he doesn't.
- Will you get out of here?

529
00:35:31,044 --> 00:35:33,410
That's all right, Stephen.

530
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:37,211
I'll save you a piece of the cake
with a candle on it.

531
00:35:41,755 --> 00:35:43,814
I didn't tell you before...

532
00:35:43,890 --> 00:35:47,587
...because I was afraid
you might do something extravagant.

533
00:35:49,529 --> 00:35:53,659
It is dear of you to want to be with me
on my birthday...

534
00:35:53,733 --> 00:35:55,701
...but I won't be lonely.

535
00:35:56,469 --> 00:35:58,596
Honestly, I won't.

536
00:35:59,272 --> 00:36:03,470
And if this weather lets up,
my neuralgia will be better.

537
00:36:03,543 --> 00:36:05,408
Then maybe I <i>can...</i>

538
00:36:06,046 --> 00:36:09,140
No, it's nothing. It's just nerves.

539
00:36:12,652 --> 00:36:15,917
I had a rather gloomy letter
from home today.

540
00:36:16,156 --> 00:36:18,147
My little sister, she's not very well.

541
00:36:18,225 --> 00:36:20,386
What's wrong with her?
She got a hangover?

542
00:36:20,460 --> 00:36:25,420
But she'll be all right.
Yes, I'm holding the thought.

543
00:36:28,602 --> 00:36:30,331
No, Stephen.

544
00:36:30,737 --> 00:36:34,639
I couldn't think of you
disarranging your evening.

545
00:36:34,708 --> 00:36:36,972
I'll have another birthday next year.

546
00:36:37,043 --> 00:36:41,480
- You'll have another one next week.
- So help me, I'm going to slug you.

547
00:36:44,718 --> 00:36:47,744
If you could drop by
for just a few moments...

548
00:36:47,821 --> 00:36:50,654
...and have a glass of sherry to my health.

549
00:36:53,660 --> 00:36:56,288
I do need you so.

550
00:36:58,365 --> 00:37:00,026
Yes, dear.

551
00:37:01,534 --> 00:37:04,992
I'll meet you on our corner in five minutes.

552
00:37:05,605 --> 00:37:06,970
Goodbye.

553
00:37:08,341 --> 00:37:12,675
Say, can you beat him?
He almost stood me up for his wife.

554
00:37:13,079 --> 00:37:17,243
- Two late shoppers waiting for you.
- You can have them. I've got to hustle.

555
00:37:17,317 --> 00:37:20,582
But they asked for you by name.
Miss Crystal Allen.

556
00:37:21,855 --> 00:37:24,085
- Why me?
- Maybe they're slumming.

557
00:37:27,060 --> 00:37:29,119
Might I be of assistance?

558
00:37:30,931 --> 00:37:34,196
Yes. I'm thinking of changing my perfume.

559
00:37:35,402 --> 00:37:37,597
Something more subtle,
or something in the woodsy order?

560
00:37:37,671 --> 00:37:39,536
This, for instance.

561
00:37:40,407 --> 00:37:44,605
- Is that what you use?
- That's much too expensive for me.

562
00:37:46,446 --> 00:37:51,440
Nonsense, my dear. A pretty girl like you,
with all the rich men that float in here.

563
00:37:51,518 --> 00:37:55,215
I'm afraid, when they come to this counter,
they are thinking of other women.

564
00:37:55,889 --> 00:37:58,881
I shouldn't think you'd let that disturb you.

565
00:38:01,394 --> 00:38:03,555
Here's this new one, Summer Rain.

566
00:38:03,630 --> 00:38:06,030
That's the kind Mary Haines
is so keen about.

567
00:38:06,199 --> 00:38:07,962
Yes, that's it.

568
00:38:08,368 --> 00:38:12,327
A friend of ours, Mrs. Stephen Haines,
simply dotes on this.

569
00:38:12,605 --> 00:38:13,594
Really?

570
00:38:13,673 --> 00:38:16,574
Her husband picked it out for her.
Perhaps you sold it to him.

571
00:38:16,643 --> 00:38:18,804
Stephen Haines, the engineer?

572
00:38:19,546 --> 00:38:23,380
I'm afraid I don't remember.
We have so many men come in here.

573
00:38:24,217 --> 00:38:27,084
Awfully good looking.
Tall, fair, distinguished.

574
00:38:27,153 --> 00:38:28,745
You wouldn't overlook him.

575
00:38:29,222 --> 00:38:32,885
I'm sorry, but when one's mind
is on one's own <i>business...</i>

576
00:38:34,127 --> 00:38:38,621
Of course. And as you say,
you have so many <i>men...</i>

577
00:38:42,002 --> 00:38:46,939
I wouldn't think that one suggested
your personality at all. It's called Oomph.

578
00:38:49,943 --> 00:38:53,140
- How amusing.
- What's that?

579
00:38:53,813 --> 00:38:54,802
Closing time.

580
00:38:55,548 --> 00:38:57,641
The bum's rush in melody, dear.

581
00:38:59,753 --> 00:39:02,449
- Good night, Pat.
- Good night, Crystal.

582
00:39:03,423 --> 00:39:06,824
- I'm afraid we're keeping you.
- That's quite all right.

583
00:39:07,327 --> 00:39:11,787
I'll take this. Charge it and send.
Here's my name and address.

584
00:39:12,832 --> 00:39:16,700
25 cents. You are getting off
economically, aren't you?

585
00:39:17,203 --> 00:39:18,465
Aren't I?

586
00:39:20,340 --> 00:39:22,365
lt'll be out tomorrow, Mrs. Prowler.

587
00:39:24,277 --> 00:39:27,508
- Fowler!
- I'm so sorry, Mrs. Fowler.

588
00:39:28,081 --> 00:39:31,744
The impertinent upstart.
I won't let her get away with that.

589
00:39:31,818 --> 00:39:35,481
You weren't exactly any Pollyanna yourself.
No wonder she caught on.

590
00:39:35,555 --> 00:39:38,353
''Prowler.'' She's laughing at us.
I can see from here.

591
00:39:38,425 --> 00:39:40,950
- I believe she is.
- She called me that deliberately.

592
00:39:41,027 --> 00:39:43,518
I'll have her fired.
I'll go to management right now.

593
00:39:43,596 --> 00:39:45,496
I'll go with you.

594
00:40:02,849 --> 00:40:05,283
You never told me you could do that.

595
00:40:05,351 --> 00:40:08,582
I can do a lot of things
you don't know about.

596
00:40:09,589 --> 00:40:11,420
Bermuda's finest railway.

597
00:40:11,491 --> 00:40:14,255
- Did you like to ride on that thing?
- We had to like it.

598
00:40:14,327 --> 00:40:18,423
There wasn't a single automobile
in Bermuda. Those were our taxis.

599
00:40:18,498 --> 00:40:20,989
Now you'll see your grandmother
ride a bicycle.

600
00:40:21,067 --> 00:40:24,036
- Grandma, you can't ride a bicycle.
- Can't I? Here I come.

601
00:40:24,104 --> 00:40:26,197
Grandma, you're a riot!

602
00:40:27,407 --> 00:40:29,466
Riot? I was a catastrophe.

603
00:40:29,542 --> 00:40:33,069
- How did you ever get out of it?
- Your mother brushed me up in a dustpan.

604
00:40:34,147 --> 00:40:37,014
- What have you got on there?
- Watch and see.

605
00:40:37,550 --> 00:40:40,383
- He's giving you a run for your money.
- There!

606
00:40:40,954 --> 00:40:44,082
- That fish is dead as a doornail, Mother.
- What?

607
00:40:44,290 --> 00:40:46,656
- He wouldn't fool anybody.
- No harm in trying.

608
00:40:46,726 --> 00:40:49,194
Watch. This is where the camera
goes overboard.

609
00:40:49,262 --> 00:40:51,526
Did you drop our precious camera
in the water?

610
00:40:51,598 --> 00:40:55,830
Your precious grandma dropped in after it
straight to the bottom of the ocean.

611
00:40:56,436 --> 00:41:00,167
Not quite to the bottom.
I know I saw whales on my way up.

612
00:41:01,474 --> 00:41:06,104
- Weren't you having a good time that day?
- I was getting homesick for you.

613
00:41:06,846 --> 00:41:09,406
Until your grandmother broke it up.

614
00:41:09,949 --> 00:41:14,477
You're pretty in that picture, Mother,
with the book in front of your face.

615
00:41:15,855 --> 00:41:17,220
The show is over.

616
00:41:18,691 --> 00:41:21,785
- Homesick for me or for Daddy?
- For Sheba.

617
00:41:22,662 --> 00:41:26,496
If Sheba would have been along,
you would have stayed the full four weeks?

618
00:41:26,566 --> 00:41:28,625
- Of course.
- Your music teacher is here.

619
00:41:28,701 --> 00:41:32,330
Thanks. Don't put the machine away yet.
I want to run them for Daddy.

620
00:41:32,405 --> 00:41:34,066
I ran them for him last night.

621
00:41:34,140 --> 00:41:38,008
I bet he wished he was there
when he saw you catch that fish.

622
00:41:38,578 --> 00:41:42,639
- Yes, I bet he did.
- We missed you so while you were gone.

623
00:41:43,716 --> 00:41:46,207
- Daddy and I.
- Did you?

624
00:41:46,286 --> 00:41:49,221
Yes. He finally had to take me to the zoo
to cheer me up.

625
00:41:49,289 --> 00:41:53,385
- A fine compliment to me.
- I didn't mean it that way, Mother.

626
00:41:53,626 --> 00:41:57,790
You're better than all the lions,
tigers and elephants in the whole world.

627
00:41:57,864 --> 00:42:01,527
- Bless you.
- I saw Mrs. Potter at the zoo that day.

628
00:42:01,601 --> 00:42:04,365
Who was she visiting with? The snakes?

629
00:42:04,437 --> 00:42:06,302
Actually she was.

630
00:42:06,739 --> 00:42:10,903
Mrs. Potter said she and Auntie Sylvia
would call you up that evening in Bermuda.

631
00:42:10,977 --> 00:42:14,674
- You didn't tell me they called you up.
- Didn't I?

632
00:42:15,181 --> 00:42:17,411
They hadn't said anything worth reporting.

633
00:42:17,483 --> 00:42:21,613
<i>- Mademoiselle</i> is waiting, Mary.
- Bother. Goodbye, Grandma.

634
00:42:21,955 --> 00:42:25,288
I'll give you a lesson some day
with the camera.

635
00:42:25,725 --> 00:42:28,956
Mary, is that why
we hurried home ahead of time?

636
00:42:29,529 --> 00:42:30,655
Why, we hurried?

637
00:42:30,730 --> 00:42:34,188
Was it something those women said
to you when they called you up?

638
00:42:34,267 --> 00:42:39,227
Of course not. You're so suspicious.
I'm happy we came home when we did.

639
00:42:40,907 --> 00:42:44,399
Stephen has spent every evening with me
since I got back.

640
00:42:44,477 --> 00:42:47,537
- Are you really happy, dear?
- Divinely.

641
00:42:50,283 --> 00:42:52,148
Look me in the eye.

642
00:42:52,752 --> 00:42:56,210
- Now say it again.
- I'm divinely happy.

643
00:42:59,125 --> 00:43:02,561
Mrs. Potter called. She said
she'd see you at the fashion show.

644
00:43:02,629 --> 00:43:04,927
Will you put those things away?

645
00:43:04,998 --> 00:43:07,432
Come along this afternoon
and watch me splurge.

646
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:10,298
And listen to Edith Potter?
I'd sooner have the itch.

647
00:43:10,370 --> 00:43:12,770
I'm afraid you don't
humor my friends enough.

648
00:43:12,839 --> 00:43:15,865
It's humoring some of them
not to cut their throats.

649
00:43:15,942 --> 00:43:19,969
Now that you're home again, promise me
that you'll stay in your own ivory tower...

650
00:43:20,046 --> 00:43:22,879
...and be very noncommittal
about yourself and Stephen.

651
00:43:22,949 --> 00:43:25,679
- They won't get a thing out of me.
- Good.

652
00:43:25,752 --> 00:43:27,515
Any more advice to the lovelorn?

653
00:43:27,587 --> 00:43:30,852
You mustn't kid Mother, dear.
I was married before you were born.

654
00:43:38,931 --> 00:43:41,195
Mary, have one of these. They're delicious.

655
00:43:41,267 --> 00:43:43,758
Edith, don't tempt me.
I lost pounds in Bermuda.

656
00:43:44,404 --> 00:43:47,168
You are thin, darling.
I hope it's not from worry.

657
00:43:47,240 --> 00:43:49,504
No. The tropics are swell for the figure.

658
00:43:49,575 --> 00:43:52,669
- What did you wear there?
- Slacks, mostly. I got very sloppy.

659
00:43:52,745 --> 00:43:55,077
One always does, traveling alone.

660
00:43:55,415 --> 00:43:57,906
You ought to load up on clothes
for Stephen, dear.

661
00:43:57,984 --> 00:44:00,953
- Is he taking you out much?
- Yes, lots.

662
00:44:01,154 --> 00:44:04,248
- Come on, girls. Let's sit down.
- She can't take it.

663
00:44:05,091 --> 00:44:07,992
<i>Bonjour, Mesdames, Mesdemoiselles.</i>

664
00:44:08,394 --> 00:44:10,658
It gives me pleasure to be your cicerone...

665
00:44:10,730 --> 00:44:13,665
...on our adventurous little voyage
into Fashionland.

666
00:44:13,733 --> 00:44:16,998
But today, ladies, as an innovation,
you'll see the models...

667
00:44:17,070 --> 00:44:19,664
...go through the rhythmic movement
of everyday life.

668
00:44:19,739 --> 00:44:22,299
You'll be able to study the flow
of the new line...

669
00:44:22,375 --> 00:44:26,812
...as it responds to the ever-changing flow
of the female form divine.

670
00:44:27,347 --> 00:44:30,248
<i>Et maintenant,</i>
a little peep into the coming season.

671
00:44:30,783 --> 00:44:33,183
And a glimpse of the future, too.

672
00:44:33,586 --> 00:44:35,520
<i>Lumiere. Musique.</i>

673
00:50:20,966 --> 00:50:23,025
Princess Mara, show here, please.

674
00:50:25,471 --> 00:50:27,268
- Hello, Mary.
- Hello.

675
00:50:27,707 --> 00:50:30,369
You should have it, Mary.
You're just what it needs.

676
00:50:30,443 --> 00:50:33,810
It was Mrs. Potter who asked
for the dress, Princess.

677
00:50:34,080 --> 00:50:36,981
- I'm sorry.
- You'd sell a woman anything.

678
00:50:37,049 --> 00:50:40,246
Come here. Why don't you wear it right?
The cape goes up here.

679
00:50:40,319 --> 00:50:42,719
Stop mauling me.
What do you know about clothes?

680
00:50:42,788 --> 00:50:45,780
I'm not a model,
but nobody disputes how I wear clothes.

681
00:50:45,858 --> 00:50:47,416
You better apologize.

682
00:50:47,493 --> 00:50:49,927
It's professional jealousy.
They're good friends.

683
00:50:49,995 --> 00:50:53,362
Yes. She adores the Fowler family.
Particularly my husband.

684
00:50:53,466 --> 00:50:55,661
Are you accusing me
of flirting with Howard?

685
00:50:55,735 --> 00:50:59,432
No, but of trying to. I'd like to see
Howard bat an eye at another woman.

686
00:50:59,505 --> 00:51:01,939
I've seen him, and she's not bad either.

687
00:51:02,007 --> 00:51:04,373
- You little...
- Come on, Sylvia.

688
00:51:04,443 --> 00:51:06,411
Did you get her innuendo?

689
00:51:06,479 --> 00:51:09,607
I've always hated that creature.
The way she exploits her title.

690
00:51:09,682 --> 00:51:11,980
The one thing I'm sure of
is Howard Fowler.

691
00:51:12,051 --> 00:51:14,781
- How do you do, Mrs. Fowler?
- Hello, my dear. Hey, you.

692
00:51:14,854 --> 00:51:16,583
I don't like that.

693
00:51:17,089 --> 00:51:19,523
Howard wants me to go on a world cruise.

694
00:51:19,592 --> 00:51:22,220
- Isn't that adorable?
- It's divine!

695
00:51:22,294 --> 00:51:25,559
- Don't tell me, but how much is it?
- $225.

696
00:51:25,631 --> 00:51:27,462
- It is a nightgown, isn't it?
- Yes.

697
00:51:27,733 --> 00:51:31,066
- I'd be glad to wear it for an evening gown.
- Isn't she naive?

698
00:51:31,137 --> 00:51:32,832
Mary, you have to have it.

699
00:51:32,905 --> 00:51:35,931
If Stephen doesn't notice the nightgown,
he'll notice the bill.

700
00:51:36,008 --> 00:51:38,476
- Okay. I'll take it.
- I'll take that.

701
00:51:40,179 --> 00:51:44,946
I could use a few more gowns.
Imports with hand embroidery.

702
00:51:46,285 --> 00:51:48,753
- I'll get it back for you.
- Please don't bother.

703
00:51:48,821 --> 00:51:52,587
- Mary, how humiliating.
- I could die for you.

704
00:51:52,758 --> 00:51:55,852
What's the matter? I don't want it.
It's too expensive anyway.

705
00:51:55,928 --> 00:51:58,089
- You don't know who she is?
- No. Who?

706
00:51:58,164 --> 00:51:59,995
That's Crystal Allen.

707
00:52:06,038 --> 00:52:07,801
Yes, it's very nice.

708
00:52:09,475 --> 00:52:10,874
I'll take that, too.

709
00:52:11,110 --> 00:52:12,304
Pretty, isn't she?

710
00:52:12,378 --> 00:52:16,337
But did you hear the brazen thing?
At $225, she could use a few more.

711
00:52:16,415 --> 00:52:20,909
- You won't stand by and let that...
- Sorry, girls. It's time for my fitting.

712
00:52:32,198 --> 00:52:35,964
I've been saving a good room for you,
Mrs. Haines. Right this way.

713
00:52:36,035 --> 00:52:38,902
I'll have your fitting sent down directly.

714
00:52:44,877 --> 00:52:47,311
- Right in here, please.
- Thank you.

715
00:52:52,918 --> 00:52:57,446
Our new one-piece foundation garment.
Zips up the back, and no bone.

716
00:52:58,624 --> 00:53:03,118
Our new one-piece foundation garment.
Zips up the back, and no bone.

717
00:53:04,797 --> 00:53:09,234
Our new one-piece foundation garment.
Zips up the back, and no bone.

718
00:53:09,435 --> 00:53:11,369
- Will you open a charge?
- Yes, please.

719
00:53:11,437 --> 00:53:14,964
- May I have the name?
- Crystal Allen, the Hotel Viceroy.

720
00:53:15,140 --> 00:53:18,507
May I have your other charges?
Saks? Bergdorf? Cartier?

721
00:53:18,577 --> 00:53:22,013
- I'll be opening those in a few days.
- Then, may I have your bank?

722
00:53:22,081 --> 00:53:24,413
I've no checking account either,
at the moment.

723
00:53:24,483 --> 00:53:27,043
I'm sorry, but we must have
one business reference.

724
00:53:27,119 --> 00:53:32,113
Certainly. Mr. Stephen Haines.
He's a very old friend of my family.

725
00:53:32,691 --> 00:53:36,218
That will do.
Mrs. Haines is a very good client of ours.

726
00:53:39,098 --> 00:53:42,590
- By the way, I've never met Mrs. Haines.
- She's a dear.

727
00:53:42,768 --> 00:53:47,762
Yes, I'm sure, so I'd rather you didn't say
that I gave her husband as a reference.

728
00:53:48,407 --> 00:53:50,739
- Do you mind?
- Of course not, Miss Allen.

729
00:53:50,809 --> 00:53:53,835
- Thank you.
- We understand.

730
00:53:53,979 --> 00:53:57,005
- What do you mean, you understand?
- I mean...

731
00:53:57,082 --> 00:53:59,209
- Never mind.
- I hope you don't think l...

732
00:53:59,285 --> 00:54:00,843
No, it's quite all right.

733
00:54:02,288 --> 00:54:06,088
It's so dreadful living in a strange city
all alone.

734
00:54:06,158 --> 00:54:10,322
You have to be so careful not to do
anything people might misconstrue.

735
00:54:10,396 --> 00:54:12,387
I don't know Mrs. Haines yet...

736
00:54:12,464 --> 00:54:16,093
...and I'd hate to get off on the wrong foot
before I met her socially.

737
00:54:16,168 --> 00:54:19,228
Naturally. Women are funny
about little things like that.

738
00:54:19,305 --> 00:54:22,138
Wait. You know that blue <i>jersey...</i>
Unzip me, will you?

739
00:54:22,207 --> 00:54:25,108
That blue jersey you had
all drippy with embroidery?

740
00:54:25,177 --> 00:54:26,269
The blue negligee?

741
00:54:26,345 --> 00:54:28,210
- Will you bring that in?
- Certainly.

742
00:54:29,515 --> 00:54:33,542
- That really suits you, Mrs. Haines.
- Yes. It is nice, isn't it?

743
00:54:33,886 --> 00:54:36,753
- Is there something wrong?
- No. It's really charming.

744
00:54:36,822 --> 00:54:39,188
- May I come in?
- I'll get your hat, Mrs. Haines.

745
00:54:39,258 --> 00:54:40,623
Sit down, Sylvia.

746
00:54:40,893 --> 00:54:45,262
- Why don't you confide in me?
- Will you please stay out of my affairs?

747
00:54:45,331 --> 00:54:49,961
I won't. If you think I'll let you hide
your head in the sand, you're mistaken.

748
00:54:50,035 --> 00:54:53,004
You're the only one in New York
that doesn't know all about it.

749
00:54:53,072 --> 00:54:57,065
Howard says that Stephen
hasn't been seen in the club for weeks.

750
00:54:58,610 --> 00:55:00,441
Go away.

751
00:55:00,512 --> 00:55:04,608
Show that model to Miss Allen, there.
Your hat, Mrs. Haines.

752
00:55:07,720 --> 00:55:11,816
- Is that Crystal Allen across the hall?
- Yes, she's a new customer.

753
00:55:11,890 --> 00:55:12,982
Do you know her?

754
00:55:13,058 --> 00:55:16,357
- Has she a lot of money?
- She knows where to get a lot.

755
00:55:16,428 --> 00:55:19,090
She's buying everything she sees,
regardless.

756
00:55:19,164 --> 00:55:22,065
- Mrs. Haines, are you ill?
- No, just tired.

757
00:55:22,134 --> 00:55:23,795
You've been standing too long.

758
00:55:23,869 --> 00:55:26,337
- Go get her a glass of sherry.
- Surely.

759
00:55:27,006 --> 00:55:31,340
You'd feel so much better
if you talked this out with someone.

760
00:55:31,477 --> 00:55:34,310
Stephen's a worm,
spending money on a girl like that.

761
00:55:34,380 --> 00:55:35,711
Shut up.

762
00:55:35,948 --> 00:55:39,645
Do you like being made ridiculous
before all your friends? Don't be a fool.

763
00:55:39,718 --> 00:55:42,983
- Go in there.
- Go in there? I'm going home.

764
00:55:46,158 --> 00:55:48,854
Now's your chance to go there
and put an end to this.

765
00:55:48,927 --> 00:55:50,895
Go in and say a few quiet words.

766
00:55:50,963 --> 00:55:54,194
Tell her you'll make Stephen's life
a tornado until he gives her up.

767
00:55:54,266 --> 00:55:56,894
Look where she was six months ago
and where she's now.

768
00:55:56,969 --> 00:56:00,666
Will you please let me do what I want to
with my own life?

769
00:56:03,542 --> 00:56:06,739
She may be a perfectly marvelous influence
for your husband...

770
00:56:06,812 --> 00:56:09,610
...but she won't do your child any good.

771
00:56:11,216 --> 00:56:12,444
What do you mean?

772
00:56:12,518 --> 00:56:15,510
Far be it from me to tell you things
you don't care to hear.

773
00:56:15,587 --> 00:56:19,648
I've known this all along. Edith wanted me
to tell you when you were in Bermuda.

774
00:56:19,725 --> 00:56:21,386
But did I utter?

775
00:56:21,460 --> 00:56:23,985
What's this got to do with my child?

776
00:56:24,229 --> 00:56:26,595
It was while you were away.
Edith saw them.

777
00:56:26,665 --> 00:56:29,532
Stephen, that creature and Little Mary
lunching in the park.

778
00:56:29,601 --> 00:56:31,626
She said they were having a happy time.

779
00:56:31,703 --> 00:56:35,730
That beezle had her arm around Little Mary
and was kissing her between every bite.

780
00:56:35,808 --> 00:56:39,244
When I heard that,
I was positively heartsick, dear.

781
00:56:40,312 --> 00:56:43,281
But as you say, it's your affair, not mine.

782
00:56:43,715 --> 00:56:47,811
No doubt that girl will make
a fine step-mama for your daughter.

783
00:57:04,470 --> 00:57:05,767
Come in.

784
00:57:09,007 --> 00:57:11,737
- I beg your pardon.
- I am Mrs. Stephen Haines.

785
00:57:13,745 --> 00:57:17,545
- Sorry, but I don't think I know you.
- I believe it's my husband you know.

786
00:57:20,619 --> 00:57:24,020
- Stephen's told you.
- No, he's never mentioned you.

787
00:57:24,089 --> 00:57:26,956
- Here's the blue negligee you ordered.
- Stay out of here!

788
00:57:27,025 --> 00:57:29,585
But I've known about you for some time.

789
00:57:29,661 --> 00:57:33,222
That'll be news to Stephen.
Personally, I'm glad you know.

790
00:57:33,298 --> 00:57:36,665
I've kept still because I knew it wouldn't
take him long to get fed up.

791
00:57:36,735 --> 00:57:39,568
Don't lay any bets on that. I'm not you.

792
00:57:39,638 --> 00:57:42,334
You've been seeing my daughter.
That's why I came in.

793
00:57:42,407 --> 00:57:45,342
- I won't have you around my daughter.
- Don't get hysterical.

794
00:57:45,410 --> 00:57:48,573
What do I care about her?
I'm sick of hearing about her.

795
00:57:48,647 --> 00:57:50,740
You won't have to hear
about her anymore...

796
00:57:50,816 --> 00:57:54,809
...because you and my husband
aren't going on seeing each other.

797
00:57:55,020 --> 00:57:57,818
That's rather up to Stephen,
don't you think?

798
00:57:58,290 --> 00:58:01,521
Completely,
so you better start making other plans.

799
00:58:03,795 --> 00:58:06,229
I'm taking my marching orders
from Stephen.

800
00:58:06,665 --> 00:58:09,532
He seems to be satisfied
with this arrangement.

801
00:58:09,601 --> 00:58:13,799
Don't force any issues unless you want
to cause plenty of trouble.

802
00:58:15,407 --> 00:58:18,433
You've made it impossible for me
to do anything else.

803
00:58:18,510 --> 00:58:21,104
- You're very confident, aren't you?
- Yes.

804
00:58:21,180 --> 00:58:24,206
Because I know Stephen couldn't love
a girl like you.

805
00:58:24,283 --> 00:58:26,911
If he couldn't, he's an awfully good actor.

806
00:58:27,653 --> 00:58:30,247
What have you got to kick about?

807
00:58:30,322 --> 00:58:34,088
You've got everything that matters.
The name, the position, the money.

808
00:58:35,194 --> 00:58:39,062
My husband's love happens to mean
more to me than those things.

809
00:58:39,565 --> 00:58:41,795
Can the sob stuff, Mrs. Haines.

810
00:58:41,867 --> 00:58:45,166
You noble wives and mothers
bore the brains out of me.

811
00:58:45,671 --> 00:58:49,698
- I'll bet you bore your husbands, too.
- You're a hard one, aren't you?

812
00:58:49,775 --> 00:58:52,539
I can be soft on the right occasion.

813
00:58:53,612 --> 00:58:55,807
What did you expect me to do?

814
00:58:55,881 --> 00:58:58,816
Burst into tears,
and beg you to forgive me?

815
00:58:59,318 --> 00:59:01,980
Isn't that what you really came in here for?

816
00:59:02,521 --> 00:59:05,649
Not after seeing you.
You're more typical than I dared hope.

817
00:59:05,891 --> 00:59:09,452
Honey, that goes double. Get this.

818
00:59:09,761 --> 00:59:13,857
I'd break up your snug little roost if I could,
but I don't stand a chance.

819
00:59:13,932 --> 00:59:16,958
Don't think it's because your husband
isn't crazy about me.

820
00:59:17,035 --> 00:59:22,029
It's because he lets old-fashioned
sentiment put the Indian sign on him.

821
00:59:22,307 --> 00:59:25,470
I'm glad you understand the strength
of sentiment, Miss Allen...

822
00:59:25,544 --> 00:59:28,911
...because its beauty is something
you'll never know.

823
00:59:32,317 --> 00:59:35,047
This happens to be my room, Mrs. Haines.

824
00:59:35,621 --> 00:59:39,751
It's yours, yes, for the time being,
like everything else you've got.

825
00:59:39,825 --> 00:59:42,953
May I suggest, if you're dressing
to please Stephen, not that one.

826
00:59:43,028 --> 00:59:45,258
He doesn't like such obvious effects.

827
00:59:45,330 --> 00:59:50,267
Thanks for the tip. But when anything
I wear doesn't please him, I take it off.

828
00:59:57,976 --> 01:00:00,877
That's what she calls
meeting Mrs. Haines socially.

829
01:00:00,946 --> 01:00:04,905
- I feel sorry for Mrs. Haines. She's so nice.
- She should've kept her mouth shut.

830
01:00:04,983 --> 01:00:07,850
- Now she's in the soup.
- Allen's smart.

831
01:00:07,919 --> 01:00:10,786
She's fixed it so anything Mr. Haines says
will sound wrong.

832
01:00:10,856 --> 01:00:14,087
- She'll get him, sure.
- Look at that chassis. She's got him now.

833
01:00:14,159 --> 01:00:17,026
You can't trust any man.
That's all they want.

834
01:00:17,095 --> 01:00:19,325
What else have we got to give?

835
01:00:20,666 --> 01:00:24,363
Our new one-piece foundation garment.
Zips up the back, and no bone.

836
01:00:25,404 --> 01:00:28,635
Ready? Up, over, up, down.

837
01:00:30,242 --> 01:00:31,402
Up, stretch, up, together.

838
01:00:41,320 --> 01:00:44,517
My sympathies are with Mrs. Haines.
They always are with the woman.

839
01:00:44,589 --> 01:00:47,752
She's been stupid about it.
She walked in and faced the creature.

840
01:00:47,859 --> 01:00:50,419
I begged her not to,
''Mary, where's your dignity? <i>''</i>

841
01:00:50,495 --> 01:00:52,827
- My scars!
- Very good for adhesions. Up!

842
01:00:52,964 --> 01:00:54,989
No more ''up.'' This has got me down.

843
01:00:55,067 --> 01:00:57,831
Rest a moment and relax your diaphragm,
if you can.

844
01:00:57,903 --> 01:01:01,737
If only she'd decide to get a divorce.
It's hard on her friends not knowing.

845
01:01:01,807 --> 01:01:04,708
- You can't ask them anywhere.
- On your side.

846
01:01:05,110 --> 01:01:06,304
Ready? Up, down.

847
01:01:06,378 --> 01:01:09,006
For her daughter's sake,
she has to hang on. I would.

848
01:01:09,081 --> 01:01:10,105
Watch your knees!

849
01:01:10,182 --> 01:01:13,777
She should not have told him.
When a man's into that, he needs time.

850
01:01:13,852 --> 01:01:14,876
Thigh in!

851
01:01:14,953 --> 01:01:17,114
- She never listens to us.
- How doesn't she?

852
01:01:17,189 --> 01:01:21,148
Whatever she wants to do is okay by me.
I've got to be loyal to Mrs. Haines.

853
01:01:21,226 --> 01:01:24,059
I'm simply exhausted.

854
01:01:24,730 --> 01:01:27,961
Suppose you try something simpler,
like crawling up the wall.

855
01:01:28,033 --> 01:01:30,092
What I go through to keep my figure.

856
01:01:30,168 --> 01:01:32,762
Do I see red when some
fat, lazy, dinner partner says:

857
01:01:32,838 --> 01:01:35,773
''What do you do with yourself
all day, Mrs. Fowler? <i>''</i>

858
01:01:36,842 --> 01:01:41,040
Arms flat. Crawl slowly up the wall.

859
01:01:41,580 --> 01:01:44,014
They way you say that
makes me feel like vermin.

860
01:01:44,082 --> 01:01:47,074
That shouldn't take much effort.
I mean crawling up the wall.

861
01:01:47,152 --> 01:01:49,916
- Hello, Sylvia.
- You're late again, after all I've done.

862
01:01:51,623 --> 01:01:55,423
Please! Let's begin with posture.

863
01:01:56,061 --> 01:02:00,555
- A lady always enters a room erect.
- Lots of my friends exit horizontally.

864
01:02:01,099 --> 01:02:03,397
Knees apart, sit on the wall.

865
01:02:03,835 --> 01:02:06,770
Relax. Roll slowly up the wall...

866
01:02:06,838 --> 01:02:09,705
...pressing each vertebrae
as hard as you can.

867
01:02:09,775 --> 01:02:11,606
Shoulders back. Heads back.

868
01:02:11,710 --> 01:02:14,201
Mrs. Fowler, lift yourself behind the ears.

869
01:02:14,279 --> 01:02:16,577
Now, chin up, elbows bent.

870
01:02:16,648 --> 01:02:17,774
Up on your toes.

871
01:02:17,849 --> 01:02:20,374
Arms out,
shove with the small of your back.

872
01:02:20,452 --> 01:02:24,286
- John's furious that you're paying.
- He ought to be darn glad he's not.

873
01:02:24,356 --> 01:02:26,324
You're still giving him your income?

874
01:02:26,391 --> 01:02:29,053
He's so proud,
he resents taking that tiny amount.

875
01:02:29,127 --> 01:02:32,255
- He resents it because there isn't more.
- Tuck under, please.

876
01:02:32,330 --> 01:02:35,094
You don't understand,
he's so clever but makes so little.

877
01:02:35,167 --> 01:02:39,228
You should hang on to your income.
It's a married woman's only protection.

878
01:02:39,304 --> 01:02:41,204
Are you as you were
when you left the wall?

879
01:02:41,273 --> 01:02:43,764
- I am.
- No, Mrs. Fowler, you're not.

880
01:02:43,842 --> 01:02:46,970
Not this, that. Try it, please.

881
01:02:49,314 --> 01:02:51,646
That's better. Relax on the mat.

882
01:02:53,919 --> 01:02:55,079
Ready?

883
01:02:55,220 --> 01:02:56,482
One, two.

884
01:03:00,926 --> 01:03:03,793
Bend, stretch, you know. Ready?

885
01:03:03,862 --> 01:03:07,525
Bend, stretch, bend, down.
Plenty of pull on the hamstrings, please.

886
01:03:07,632 --> 01:03:08,997
Sylvia! Hello, Peggy!

887
01:03:09,067 --> 01:03:11,433
- What are you doing here?
- I'm having a facial.

888
01:03:11,503 --> 01:03:13,562
Darling, I've done the most awful thing.

889
01:03:13,638 --> 01:03:15,572
We're in the middle of our exercises.

890
01:03:15,640 --> 01:03:19,337
Go tell them I want my paraffin bath.
I'm simply exhausted.

891
01:03:19,411 --> 01:03:21,140
You've hardly moved a muscle.

892
01:03:21,213 --> 01:03:25,309
- Who's carcass is this, yours or mine?
- It's yours, but I'm paid to exercise it.

893
01:03:25,750 --> 01:03:28,617
- You talk like a horse trainer.
- You're getting warm!

894
01:03:29,488 --> 01:03:31,183
- How do you like...
- What?

895
01:03:31,256 --> 01:03:33,816
Darling, I've just done
the most ghastly thing.

896
01:03:33,892 --> 01:03:35,154
Move over, will you?

897
01:03:35,227 --> 01:03:39,357
It wasn't until I got here during my <i>facial...</i>
I could bite my tongue off...

898
01:03:39,431 --> 01:03:40,557
Edith, what is it?

899
01:03:40,632 --> 01:03:42,190
I ate with Dolly Dupuyster...

900
01:03:42,267 --> 01:03:46,203
You forgot she's writing a gossip column,
and you told her something about me.

901
01:03:46,271 --> 01:03:47,966
You know I never give you away.

902
01:03:48,039 --> 01:03:50,599
- I told her about Stephen and Mary.
- Oh, that!

903
01:03:50,675 --> 01:03:54,634
- It wasn't until I got here...
- It'll be in all the dreadful scandal sheets!

904
01:03:54,713 --> 01:03:58,615
I know! I've been racking my brains
to try and remember what it was I said.

905
01:03:58,683 --> 01:04:03,552
I said that Mary went into the fitting room
and yanked the coat off the Allen girl.

906
01:04:03,622 --> 01:04:04,953
You didn't!

907
01:04:05,023 --> 01:04:09,551
I don't know if I said ermine or sable coat,
but I said she gave her an awful smack!

908
01:04:10,295 --> 01:04:11,819
That's what Sylvia told me.

909
01:04:11,897 --> 01:04:13,296
- I didn't.
- You did, too.

910
01:04:13,365 --> 01:04:15,959
I didn't expect you'd tell it
to some cheap reporter.

911
01:04:16,034 --> 01:04:18,559
It doesn't matter.
The divorce is practically settled.

912
01:04:18,637 --> 01:04:20,537
- Who said so?
- You did!

913
01:04:20,605 --> 01:04:25,440
I said, ''She can't broadcast her affairs
without them appearing in the <i>scandals.''</i>

914
01:04:25,510 --> 01:04:27,375
- She didn't broadcast them.
- Who did?

915
01:04:27,445 --> 01:04:29,538
You made it perfectly impossible for Mary.

916
01:04:29,614 --> 01:04:32,048
That's the sort of talk
that mixes everything all up.

917
01:04:32,117 --> 01:04:33,948
The paraffin bath is ready now.

918
01:04:34,019 --> 01:04:37,079
Don't worry,
I'll give Dupuyster a ring. I'll fix it.

919
01:04:37,155 --> 01:04:38,213
How?

920
01:04:38,323 --> 01:04:40,951
- I'll say you were lying.
- You'll do no such thing!

921
01:04:41,026 --> 01:04:43,893
Then let the story ride.
It'll be forgotten in the morning.

922
01:04:43,962 --> 01:04:47,261
Remember what they wrote about that girl
who jumped out the window?

923
01:04:47,332 --> 01:04:50,324
See, I can't even remember her name.
So who cares?

924
01:04:50,835 --> 01:04:54,066
- Mrs. Potter, you come right back!
- This is like a boarding school.

925
01:04:54,139 --> 01:04:57,233
- It's such a waste of money.
- Relaxing is part of my facial.

926
01:04:57,309 --> 01:05:01,211
Then you should relax completely
Mrs. Potter, from the chin up.

927
01:05:01,279 --> 01:05:03,804
Honestly, the class feeling
you run into nowadays.

928
01:05:03,882 --> 01:05:06,112
I'm so sick of creatures who insult you.

929
01:05:06,184 --> 01:05:09,915
Sylvia is a perfectly dreadful woman
and I'm going to tell her so!

930
01:05:09,988 --> 01:05:13,856
She can't help it. It's her tough luck
that she wasn't born deaf and dumb.

931
01:05:13,925 --> 01:05:17,656
Take a tip from me.
Keep out of other women's troubles.

932
01:05:17,729 --> 01:05:20,527
I've never had a fight
with a girlfriend in my life.

933
01:05:20,599 --> 01:05:23,966
I see no evil, I hear no evil, I speak no evil.

934
01:05:38,850 --> 01:05:42,411
Your idea of love and mine
are slightly different, Stephen!

935
01:05:42,854 --> 01:05:46,153
I don't like being one of a group,
even if I am first!

936
01:05:50,962 --> 01:05:53,897
Stephen, we can't go on like this.

937
01:05:59,771 --> 01:06:01,398
What's happened?

938
01:06:04,009 --> 01:06:06,307
It's come. They're having a showdown.

939
01:06:06,378 --> 01:06:09,677
- What's happened?
- Give me a cup of coffee and I'll tell you.

940
01:06:09,748 --> 01:06:12,876
She said that he's put her
in an impossible situation.

941
01:06:12,951 --> 01:06:16,614
People point at her in the street
because of the picture in the papers.

942
01:06:16,688 --> 01:06:17,882
Ain't it the truth!

943
01:06:17,956 --> 01:06:20,789
He blames it on her girlfriends
for spilling it all.

944
01:06:20,859 --> 01:06:23,259
That ain't far from wrong, either.

945
01:06:23,495 --> 01:06:26,862
- Makes you lose your faith in marriage.
- Whose faith in marriage?

946
01:06:26,931 --> 01:06:30,059
- Don't you believe in marriage?
- Sure I do, for women.

947
01:06:30,135 --> 01:06:32,330
But it's the sons of Adam
they have to marry.

948
01:06:32,404 --> 01:06:33,962
What else did they say?

949
01:06:34,039 --> 01:06:37,236
Mr. Haines says,
<i>''I</i> told you I'd give her up and I did.

950
01:06:37,308 --> 01:06:39,572
''And I was a swine about the way I did <i>it.''</i>

951
01:06:39,644 --> 01:06:41,168
How do you think he did it?

952
01:06:41,246 --> 01:06:43,544
Maybe he said,
''Scram, the wife is on to <i>us.''</i>

953
01:06:43,615 --> 01:06:47,449
She seemed hurt by him saying
he was a swine the way he gave her up.

954
01:06:47,519 --> 01:06:50,818
So she says very quiet,
''Would you like to go back to her? <i>''</i>

955
01:06:50,889 --> 01:06:52,754
Did he lie in his teeth to that one?

956
01:06:52,824 --> 01:06:55,315
The way he said he wouldn't,
I kind of believed him.

957
01:06:55,393 --> 01:06:59,489
She said, ''You should really make
your manner more convincing, <i>Stephen.''</i>

958
01:06:59,564 --> 01:07:02,533
Then she tried to laugh,
but it didn't come off very well.

959
01:07:02,600 --> 01:07:05,330
And he says,
''Aren't you ever going to trust me again? <i>''</i>

960
01:07:05,403 --> 01:07:06,734
I hope she said, ''No.''

961
01:07:06,805 --> 01:07:10,263
You can't trust none of them
no further than I can kick this lemon pie.

962
01:07:10,341 --> 01:07:13,538
No, he said this girl was really a good girl.

963
01:07:13,611 --> 01:07:17,513
That's why he feels he owes her.
She wouldn't take nothing for months.

964
01:07:17,582 --> 01:07:20,710
That one's a clever one.
She'd have to be to get Mr. Haines.

965
01:07:20,785 --> 01:07:22,912
That's what the madam said. She said:

966
01:07:22,987 --> 01:07:26,889
''Stephen, can't you see the girl is only
interested in you for your money? <i>''</i>

967
01:07:26,958 --> 01:07:28,425
That made him sore.

968
01:07:28,493 --> 01:07:32,088
A man hates to be told no woman
but his wife is fool enough to love him.

969
01:07:32,163 --> 01:07:35,360
She brought up him taking Little Mary
to lunch with that creature.

970
01:07:35,433 --> 01:07:39,233
He said she happened to be passing by
as he and Little Mary were taking lunch.

971
01:07:39,304 --> 01:07:41,864
- That's a laugh.
- That's the way she took it.

972
01:07:41,940 --> 01:07:44,204
Then they both got mad.
He started telling her...

973
01:07:44,275 --> 01:07:47,904
...what a good husband he'd been and
how hard he'd worked for her and Mary.

974
01:07:47,979 --> 01:07:51,915
She kept interrupting, saying that
she wasn't such a washout herself.

975
01:07:51,983 --> 01:07:55,885
Anybody that's ever been married
knows that line backwards and forwards.

976
01:07:55,954 --> 01:07:58,422
Then somewhere in there, he starts saying:

977
01:07:58,523 --> 01:08:02,084
''Mary, I may have been a heel,
but you've always been first with <i>me.''</i>

978
01:08:02,160 --> 01:08:05,220
First! Don't that sound like a husband!

979
01:08:05,330 --> 01:08:08,993
That's what she thought, I guess.
Because she said kind of hysterical:

980
01:08:09,067 --> 01:08:12,833
''Stephen, I don't go for being one
of a group, even if I am <i>first.''</i>

981
01:08:12,904 --> 01:08:15,168
That gets him kind of sore and he says:

982
01:08:15,240 --> 01:08:18,971
<i>''I</i> don't ask you to be fair to me,
but please remember we have a child...

983
01:08:19,043 --> 01:08:22,410
<i>''...and</i> we do owe her <i>something.''</i>
That's when she really blew up.

984
01:08:22,480 --> 01:08:26,507
No woman wants to be told she's being
kept on just to run a kindergarten.

985
01:08:26,584 --> 01:08:28,950
Finally it got to him saying:

986
01:08:29,020 --> 01:08:31,488
''You've known about us for weeks...

987
01:08:31,556 --> 01:08:34,184
<i>''...why</i> did you wait until now
to make a fool of me? <i>''</i>

988
01:08:34,259 --> 01:08:35,851
As if he needed her help!

989
01:08:35,927 --> 01:08:40,921
Then she says suddenly in a low voice,
''We can't go on like <i>this.''</i>

990
01:08:41,166 --> 01:08:44,294
And he says, ''You're right, we <i>can't.''</i>

991
01:08:44,602 --> 01:08:46,502
You're quite an actress, ain't you?

992
01:08:46,571 --> 01:08:49,096
My boyfriend says I got eyes
like Jeanette McDonald's.

993
01:08:49,174 --> 01:08:50,937
Did he say anything about your legs?

994
01:08:51,009 --> 01:08:53,944
- How did it all end?
- It ain't ended. They're still at it.

995
01:08:54,012 --> 01:08:55,843
Then what are you doing down here?

996
01:08:55,914 --> 01:08:59,372
Get back there and see who's ahead.
We may be out of our jobs tomorrow.

997
01:09:18,469 --> 01:09:20,903
- Well?
- I want some more coffee. I'm done in.

998
01:09:20,972 --> 01:09:23,167
Relax and tell me everything
that happened.

999
01:09:23,241 --> 01:09:25,505
When I got there, the first thing I heard...

1000
01:09:25,577 --> 01:09:28,341
...was the madam saying,
<i>''I</i> want a <i>divorce.''</i>

1001
01:09:28,413 --> 01:09:29,402
Abdicating!

1002
01:09:29,480 --> 01:09:31,573
You could have knocked him down
with a feather.

1003
01:09:31,649 --> 01:09:34,209
I'd like to knock him down with this.
What did he say?

1004
01:09:34,285 --> 01:09:37,982
He said he didn't blame her,
but he wished she'd think things over.

1005
01:09:38,056 --> 01:09:42,015
He said she should go to bed
and he was going out for some fresh air.

1006
01:09:42,093 --> 01:09:44,425
- The old hat trick!
- And she says, ''Fresh air! <i>''</i>

1007
01:09:44,495 --> 01:09:48,431
''ls the air fresher in the Viceroy Hotel? <i>''</i>
That's where the girl lives.

1008
01:09:48,499 --> 01:09:52,833
He says, ''You never want to see me again
and then I can't even go out for <i>air.''</i>

1009
01:09:52,904 --> 01:09:56,237
You shouldn't let them out without a leash.
What happened then?

1010
01:09:56,307 --> 01:09:59,071
Nothing for a time,
he just kept walking up and down.

1011
01:09:59,143 --> 01:10:00,508
He was thinking.

1012
01:10:00,578 --> 01:10:03,240
Then he said he was going out,
so I got ready to scoot.

1013
01:10:03,314 --> 01:10:06,909
I heard her call, ''Stephen! <i>''</i>
And he stops on the landing and she says:

1014
01:10:06,985 --> 01:10:09,818
''Don't slam the front door,
the servants might <i>hear.''</i>

1015
01:10:09,888 --> 01:10:11,480
So I came down here.

1016
01:10:11,556 --> 01:10:13,751
I feel so sad for her.

1017
01:10:13,958 --> 01:10:17,189
- Do you think they're going to break up?
- I don't know.

1018
01:10:17,262 --> 01:10:21,221
The first man that can explain
how he can be in love with his wife...

1019
01:10:21,299 --> 01:10:25,861
...and another woman, is going to win
that prize they give out in Sweden.

1020
01:11:01,496 --> 01:11:04,158
- Here are some books you can put in.
- Yes, ma'am.

1021
01:11:04,232 --> 01:11:06,826
Mr. Haines won't want that old thing.

1022
01:11:10,238 --> 01:11:12,968
- It's none of my business.
- Mrs. Haines.

1023
01:11:15,543 --> 01:11:17,408
Put this in, too, will you?

1024
01:11:19,014 --> 01:11:20,413
The train leaves in an hour.

1025
01:11:20,482 --> 01:11:23,212
Give yourself plenty of time.
The traffic is maddening.

1026
01:11:23,284 --> 01:11:24,615
Yes, Mother.

1027
01:11:26,054 --> 01:11:29,512
Stephen's secretary is bringing around
more papers for me to sign.

1028
01:11:29,591 --> 01:11:31,821
I never knew there could be so many.

1029
01:11:31,893 --> 01:11:33,827
You've shown everything to your lawyers?

1030
01:11:33,895 --> 01:11:36,227
They keep telling me
I'm getting a raw deal.

1031
01:11:37,232 --> 01:11:39,598
It isn't true.
Stephen's been very generous.

1032
01:11:39,668 --> 01:11:42,831
I'm sure he has.
You're both making a terrible mistake.

1033
01:11:42,904 --> 01:11:45,372
- Please, Mother.
- You and Stephen have a child.

1034
01:11:45,440 --> 01:11:47,840
What good will it do her...

1035
01:11:47,909 --> 01:11:51,902
...to be brought up in a house
full of quarreling and suspicion?

1036
01:11:53,314 --> 01:11:55,282
She'll be better off with just me.

1037
01:11:55,350 --> 01:11:58,717
No, she won't. A child needs both
its parents in one home.

1038
01:11:58,787 --> 01:11:59,913
What's the use?

1039
01:11:59,988 --> 01:12:03,151
Every argument just keeps
going around in circles.

1040
01:12:04,225 --> 01:12:06,955
Besides, it's too late now.

1041
01:12:07,195 --> 01:12:09,891
No. It's never too late
when you love someone.

1042
01:12:09,964 --> 01:12:12,933
Call this off.
Stephen doesn't want a divorce.

1043
01:12:13,001 --> 01:12:16,266
- Why doesn't he fight me on it, then?
- He's not the fighting kind!

1044
01:12:16,337 --> 01:12:18,999
- Neither am I.
- Blast these modern laws!

1045
01:12:19,074 --> 01:12:23,135
50 years ago, women couldn't get divorces
and made the best of situations like this.

1046
01:12:23,211 --> 01:12:27,477
Sometimes, out of situations like this,
they made very good things indeed.

1047
01:12:27,549 --> 01:12:30,450
- Mr. Haines' secretary, ma'am.
- I'll see her in a few minutes.

1048
01:12:30,518 --> 01:12:34,010
Bathe your eyes. You don't want that
adding machine to see you like this.

1049
01:12:34,089 --> 01:12:36,114
Remember, you have to tell Little Mary.

1050
01:12:36,191 --> 01:12:39,524
Yes, I'm going to
but I've been putting it off <i>because...</i>

1051
01:12:39,594 --> 01:12:44,224
You're hoping that a miracle will keep you
from making a mess of your life.

1052
01:12:49,671 --> 01:12:53,004
Did you ever think
that Stephen might marry that girl?

1053
01:12:59,047 --> 01:13:00,105
No.

1054
01:13:02,217 --> 01:13:05,243
- He wouldn't do that.
- What makes you so sure?

1055
01:13:08,857 --> 01:13:12,190
Because Stephen, deep down,
still loves me.

1056
01:13:14,195 --> 01:13:17,221
But he won't find it out
until I've gone away.

1057
01:13:21,503 --> 01:13:25,564
Make Mary write to me
in Reno at least once a week, will you?

1058
01:13:27,375 --> 01:13:29,605
And don't spoil her too much.

1059
01:13:29,844 --> 01:13:33,473
Spoil her? You'd think
I never raised children of my own.

1060
01:13:37,285 --> 01:13:40,118
Good afternoon.
This is Miss Trimmerback from the office.

1061
01:13:40,188 --> 01:13:42,122
- She's a notary.
- How do you do?

1062
01:13:42,190 --> 01:13:44,351
I brought the inventories of the furniture.

1063
01:13:44,425 --> 01:13:48,589
Mr. Haines wants to know
if he can have the portrait of Little Mary.

1064
01:13:49,264 --> 01:13:52,062
- Yes, but it's in storage.
- This will get it out.

1065
01:13:52,133 --> 01:13:53,566
Sign here.

1066
01:13:55,403 --> 01:13:57,735
The cook's letter of reference.

1067
01:13:57,906 --> 01:13:59,339
Sign here.

1068
01:14:00,008 --> 01:14:02,499
The insurance papers. Sign here.

1069
01:14:03,978 --> 01:14:06,845
Transfer papers on the car.
What do you want done with it?

1070
01:14:06,915 --> 01:14:09,042
- I don't know.
- I'll find a garage.

1071
01:14:09,117 --> 01:14:12,211
Do you care to rent this apartment,
Mrs. Haines?

1072
01:14:12,954 --> 01:14:14,819
I thought of taking a smaller one.

1073
01:14:14,889 --> 01:14:18,985
This will give us power of attorney
until you return. Sign here.

1074
01:14:19,060 --> 01:14:22,621
Your husband took the privilege
of drawing you a new will.

1075
01:14:23,531 --> 01:14:24,896
I'd <i>really...</i>

1076
01:14:24,966 --> 01:14:28,129
It's to your advantage, not his.
This will cuts off Mr. Haines.

1077
01:14:28,203 --> 01:14:30,398
Your attorneys
overlooked that small detail.

1078
01:14:30,471 --> 01:14:33,463
We'll need three witnesses.
Your maid will do.

1079
01:14:33,641 --> 01:14:36,542
Jane, will you witness this? It's my will.

1080
01:14:36,611 --> 01:14:38,704
- Mrs. Haines!
- Sign here.

1081
01:14:40,181 --> 01:14:43,309
You can always make changes
in the event of your remarriage.

1082
01:14:43,384 --> 01:14:47,150
Don't hesitate to let me know
if there's anything I can ever do for you.

1083
01:14:47,222 --> 01:14:49,156
There'll be nothing, Miss Watts.

1084
01:14:49,224 --> 01:14:51,818
There are always tag ends to a divorce,
Mrs. Haines.

1085
01:14:51,893 --> 01:14:56,387
You know how Mr. Haines hates to be
bothered with inconsequential details.

1086
01:14:56,464 --> 01:14:59,558
Good afternoon, Mrs. Haines.
A pleasant journey to you.

1087
01:14:59,634 --> 01:15:00,862
Goodbye.

1088
01:15:01,069 --> 01:15:02,934
Goodbye, Mrs. Haines.

1089
01:15:03,404 --> 01:15:05,463
I wish you weren't going.

1090
01:15:05,707 --> 01:15:07,174
Thank you.

1091
01:15:08,142 --> 01:15:11,168
Mr. Haines said
to give these to you, ma'am.

1092
01:15:39,974 --> 01:15:42,169
- Mother, where are you?
- Here, dear.

1093
01:15:43,311 --> 01:15:46,405
- All set, dear?
- Yes. All set.

1094
01:15:47,849 --> 01:15:51,751
Mary, Mother would like to have
a talk with you before she goes.

1095
01:15:51,819 --> 01:15:53,548
I'll wait for you.

1096
01:15:57,425 --> 01:15:59,393
- Mary?
- Yes, Mother?

1097
01:16:08,970 --> 01:16:12,736
- Have I done something wrong?
- No, darling.

1098
01:16:15,310 --> 01:16:16,834
Sit down, dear.

1099
01:16:24,719 --> 01:16:26,949
You know Daddy
has been gone for some time.

1100
01:16:28,022 --> 01:16:29,580
A whole month.

1101
01:16:30,558 --> 01:16:32,856
- Shall I tell you why?
- Why?

1102
01:16:38,566 --> 01:16:42,093
You know when a man and woman
fall in love, what they do, don't you?

1103
01:16:42,170 --> 01:16:43,694
They kiss a lot.

1104
01:16:44,105 --> 01:16:47,836
- They get married.
- Yes, and then they have little children.

1105
01:16:48,309 --> 01:16:52,746
Sometimes married people
don't stay in love.

1106
01:16:53,448 --> 01:16:55,006
What, Mother?

1107
01:16:55,283 --> 01:16:58,150
A husband and a wife fall out of love.

1108
01:16:58,353 --> 01:17:00,150
Why do they do that?

1109
01:17:00,922 --> 01:17:03,220
I don't know, but they do.

1110
01:17:03,291 --> 01:17:07,728
And when they do,
they get un-married. You see?

1111
01:17:07,962 --> 01:17:09,020
No.

1112
01:17:10,898 --> 01:17:12,695
They do. That's all.

1113
01:17:13,334 --> 01:17:16,462
They get what is called a divorce.

1114
01:17:16,971 --> 01:17:18,199
Do they?

1115
01:17:19,273 --> 01:17:21,798
- You don't know what a divorce is?
- Yes, I do.

1116
01:17:21,876 --> 01:17:25,073
Lots of my friends have
mommies and daddies who are divorced.

1117
01:17:25,146 --> 01:17:28,115
You know I love you very much, don't you?

1118
01:17:28,683 --> 01:17:30,082
Of course.

1119
01:17:33,388 --> 01:17:37,825
So you see, Daddy and Mommy
are going to get a divorce.

1120
01:17:40,061 --> 01:17:41,858
That's why I'm going away.

1121
01:17:43,364 --> 01:17:45,059
That's why <i>I...</i>

1122
01:17:51,272 --> 01:17:55,072
Darling, I can't explain quite, but...

1123
01:17:56,344 --> 01:17:59,643
...when you're older,
I know you'll understand...

1124
01:17:59,714 --> 01:18:02,239
...and you'll forgive me. You will.

1125
01:18:02,950 --> 01:18:04,042
Baby...

1126
01:18:05,286 --> 01:18:07,117
...look at me, please.

1127
01:18:13,795 --> 01:18:15,160
I am looking at you.

1128
01:18:17,465 --> 01:18:19,763
Doesn't Daddy love you anymore?

1129
01:18:21,869 --> 01:18:23,700
No, dear, he doesn't.

1130
01:18:24,405 --> 01:18:26,168
Don't you love him?

1131
01:18:27,842 --> 01:18:30,811
<i>I...</i> No, Mary.

1132
01:18:31,345 --> 01:18:34,405
- Mother, why?
- I don't know, but it isn't Daddy's fault.

1133
01:18:34,482 --> 01:18:37,007
Or it isn't Mommy's fault. It's <i>just...</i>

1134
01:18:37,151 --> 01:18:40,609
But I thought when you loved somebody...

1135
01:18:41,189 --> 01:18:43,919
...you loved them until the day you die.

1136
01:18:44,725 --> 01:18:47,353
With children, yes.
But grownups are different.

1137
01:18:47,428 --> 01:18:49,453
They can fall out of love.

1138
01:18:49,931 --> 01:18:53,594
I won't fall out of love with you and Daddy
when I grow up.

1139
01:18:53,668 --> 01:18:55,533
Will you fall out of love with me?

1140
01:18:55,603 --> 01:18:58,800
No, darling. Never!
But that's different, too.

1141
01:18:58,873 --> 01:19:02,832
- But I don't see how!
- You'll have to take my word for it, baby.

1142
01:19:02,910 --> 01:19:07,040
The divorce has nothing to do
with our love for you. Don't you see?

1143
01:19:07,115 --> 01:19:08,480
But if you and Daddy...

1144
01:19:08,549 --> 01:19:11,347
Darling, I can explain it better
on the way to the train.

1145
01:19:11,419 --> 01:19:14,013
We'll go alone in the car. Shall we?

1146
01:19:14,355 --> 01:19:17,688
If you and Daddy
are going to get a divorce...

1147
01:19:18,593 --> 01:19:21,892
...which one won't I see again,
Daddy or you?

1148
01:19:22,497 --> 01:19:24,522
You'll live with me, Mary.

1149
01:19:25,600 --> 01:19:28,296
That's what happens
when people get divorced.

1150
01:19:28,369 --> 01:19:30,894
Children must go with their mothers.

1151
01:19:31,105 --> 01:19:33,505
But you'll see Daddy often, dear.

1152
01:19:36,444 --> 01:19:37,843
Come along, darling.

1153
01:19:37,912 --> 01:19:40,847
- Please wait for me in the car.
- Why?

1154
01:19:41,516 --> 01:19:43,507
I have to wash my hands.

1155
01:20:00,535 --> 01:20:02,799
Please, Mother!

1156
01:20:03,371 --> 01:20:05,737
Daddy, darling!

1157
01:20:06,407 --> 01:20:10,468
Why don't you do something?
Do something, Mother dear!

1158
01:20:10,811 --> 01:20:12,711
Do something!

1159
01:20:28,529 --> 01:20:31,089
Please, darling, don't. You mustn't.

1160
01:20:31,165 --> 01:20:35,067
Who'd have thought
that I'd be going to Reno, too?

1161
01:20:35,136 --> 01:20:36,330
I know.

1162
01:20:37,071 --> 01:20:38,060
Come in.

1163
01:20:38,139 --> 01:20:41,006
- Is you the lady that needs the toothbrush?
- Yes.

1164
01:20:41,776 --> 01:20:44,609
You made up your mind
to come on this trip in a hurry?

1165
01:20:44,679 --> 01:20:46,442
- Yes.
- I thought you did.

1166
01:20:46,514 --> 01:20:48,675
The porter will be
making your room up next.

1167
01:20:48,749 --> 01:20:50,011
Thank you.

1168
01:20:52,420 --> 01:20:54,411
Did you hear from Stephen?

1169
01:20:54,589 --> 01:20:58,081
This? No, that's from an old beau.

1170
01:20:59,760 --> 01:21:02,695
You'll be having lots of beaus now,
won't you?

1171
01:21:03,898 --> 01:21:06,867
I won't. I'll never look at another man.

1172
01:21:07,268 --> 01:21:10,135
When I think of the things he said to me!
My Johnny!

1173
01:21:10,204 --> 01:21:12,399
He wouldn't let me buy a car
with my money.

1174
01:21:12,473 --> 01:21:15,169
Just because he couldn't afford one,
I can't have one!

1175
01:21:15,243 --> 01:21:17,302
- He wants me to be a slave!
- No, he doesn't.

1176
01:21:17,378 --> 01:21:18,868
Yes, he does!

1177
01:21:19,013 --> 01:21:22,073
The only protection I have
is my own little income.

1178
01:21:22,149 --> 01:21:25,380
- Sounds like Sylvia.
- This time she's right.

1179
01:21:26,020 --> 01:21:29,786
If I couldn't have caught
this train to be with you...

1180
01:21:30,091 --> 01:21:32,821
...l'd have jumped right in front of it!

1181
01:21:33,461 --> 01:21:36,191
That would have been quite a feat, dear.

1182
01:21:37,431 --> 01:21:39,092
I'm such a fool.

1183
01:21:40,735 --> 01:21:42,532
Maybe Johnny is right.

1184
01:21:44,205 --> 01:21:46,833
Stop it. You'll have me crying, too.

1185
01:21:50,578 --> 01:21:51,602
Yes, dear.

1186
01:21:51,679 --> 01:21:53,271
Listen to the wheels.

1187
01:21:53,581 --> 01:21:56,880
- Do they seem to be saying anything?
- No.

1188
01:21:57,351 --> 01:22:03,756
Don't they seem to be saying, ''Go <i>back''?</i>

1189
01:22:04,292 --> 01:22:06,522
Why don't you go back to him?

1190
01:22:06,594 --> 01:22:10,086
I can't. After all, I have my pride.

1191
01:22:13,668 --> 01:22:14,965
I know.

1192
01:22:15,603 --> 01:22:20,199
- You better get some sleep, dear.
- All right. I'll see you in the morning.

1193
01:22:23,044 --> 01:22:26,013
- lf you can't sleep, dear, send for me.
- I will.

1194
01:22:26,080 --> 01:22:27,172
Good night.

1195
01:22:27,248 --> 01:22:30,274
- Porter's ready now, Mrs. Haines.
- Thank you.

1196
01:22:34,689 --> 01:22:35,781
What, darling?

1197
01:22:35,856 --> 01:22:39,053
- Mommy, will Daddy come to Reno?
- No, darling.

1198
01:22:39,126 --> 01:22:42,061
- Mommy, where is Daddy?
- I don't know and I don't care.

1199
01:22:42,129 --> 01:22:44,723
In the future,
please refer to him as ''That <i>Heel''!</i>

1200
01:22:48,169 --> 01:22:50,137
<i>Chérie,</i> won't you join me
in some champagne?

1201
01:22:52,606 --> 01:22:54,164
Why, yes.

1202
01:22:54,375 --> 01:22:57,776
You look so <i>désolée,</i>
sitting there all by yourself.

1203
01:22:57,845 --> 01:22:59,779
- Did I?
- I'm the Countess De Lave.

1204
01:22:59,847 --> 01:23:02,247
Of course,
I've seen your pictures in the paper.

1205
01:23:02,316 --> 01:23:05,410
- And I've seen yours, too.
- I'm Mrs. Stephen Haines.

1206
01:23:05,786 --> 01:23:07,549
Yes, of course.

1207
01:23:07,822 --> 01:23:11,417
Those crummy newspaper pictures
didn't do you half justice.

1208
01:23:11,492 --> 01:23:15,155
Let's all have a little party.
You, too, dearie.

1209
01:23:15,296 --> 01:23:19,289
Now, don't sit in the corner and mope.
Let's all have a little drink.

1210
01:23:19,367 --> 01:23:22,302
Champagne? Right you are.

1211
01:23:26,640 --> 01:23:29,609
This sweet little thing
is getting her first divorce, too.

1212
01:23:29,677 --> 01:23:32,771
She's a dear friend of mine.
What did you say your name was?

1213
01:23:32,847 --> 01:23:35,475
- Miriam Aarons.
- This is Mrs. Haines.

1214
01:23:36,384 --> 01:23:39,251
Yanked the scalp off that Allen woman
in the fitting room.

1215
01:23:39,320 --> 01:23:41,379
Yeah! Good for you!

1216
01:23:41,455 --> 01:23:44,390
I was afraid you were
a wet firecracker, sister. Shake!

1217
01:23:44,458 --> 01:23:46,824
- Hello.
- Cheer up, <i>chérie.</i>

1218
01:23:46,894 --> 01:23:49,624
Wait until you've lost as many
husbands as I have.

1219
01:23:49,697 --> 01:23:54,464
Married, divorced, married, divorced,
<i>L'amour, I'amour.</i>

1220
01:23:54,602 --> 01:23:56,570
- That's French for ''love.''
<i>- Oui, oui.</i>

1221
01:23:56,637 --> 01:23:59,265
But where love leads, I always follow.

1222
01:23:59,340 --> 01:24:02,036
Take it, dearie. Dip that pretty little beak.

1223
01:24:02,109 --> 01:24:04,134
Happy days.

1224
01:24:04,845 --> 01:24:06,312
Happy nights!

1225
01:24:08,516 --> 01:24:12,475
Mrs. Aarons is connected with the stage
or is it the circus, dear?

1226
01:24:12,553 --> 01:24:15,886
- It was the chorus.
- You must tell us all about it, sometime.

1227
01:24:15,956 --> 01:24:19,722
I bet you made some great hauls
out of our New York boyfriends.

1228
01:24:19,794 --> 01:24:24,163
If you mean diamonds and orchids,
that breed died out just before my time.

1229
01:24:24,231 --> 01:24:25,755
Yes, isn't it a pity?

1230
01:24:25,866 --> 01:24:29,427
I never got a <i>sou</i> out of anybody,
except my first husband, Mr. Strauss.

1231
01:24:29,503 --> 01:24:33,030
He said the most touching thing in his will.
I remember every word of it.

1232
01:24:33,107 --> 01:24:36,907
He said, ''To my beloved wife, Flora,
I leave all my estate...

1233
01:24:36,977 --> 01:24:41,414
<i>''...to</i> be administered by executors,
because she is an A-1 <i>schlemiel.''</i>

1234
01:24:41,649 --> 01:24:42,809
Wasn't that sweet?

1235
01:24:42,883 --> 01:24:45,613
Any ladle is sweet
that dishes out some gravy.

1236
01:24:45,686 --> 01:24:49,679
Isn't it true? None of my other husbands
ever gave me a dime.

1237
01:24:50,391 --> 01:24:54,259
<i>L'amour, I'amour.</i>
How it can let you down!

1238
01:24:55,696 --> 01:24:59,393
How it can pick you up again, too.
Where is this wretched train taking us?

1239
01:24:59,467 --> 01:25:02,095
- We're in the mountains, dear.
- I detest mountains.

1240
01:25:02,169 --> 01:25:05,866
They always remind me of the day Gustave
made me climb to the top of an Alp.

1241
01:25:05,940 --> 01:25:09,671
Gustave was my third husband.
Give Flora another little drinkie, dear.

1242
01:25:09,743 --> 01:25:11,210
There we were...

1243
01:25:11,378 --> 01:25:14,541
...when suddenly it struck me
that Gustave had pushed me.

1244
01:25:14,615 --> 01:25:17,482
I slid halfway down the mountain
before I realized...

1245
01:25:17,551 --> 01:25:19,985
...that he didn't love me anymore.

1246
01:25:20,054 --> 01:25:21,817
But love takes care of its own.

1247
01:25:21,889 --> 01:25:24,915
I slid right into the arms
of my fourth husband, the Count!

1248
01:25:26,160 --> 01:25:30,597
- Isn't that the bird you're divorcing now?
- But of course. What else could I do?

1249
01:25:30,664 --> 01:25:32,928
He was putting poison
in my headache powders.

1250
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:36,401
Poison! You're not
a very good judge of character, are you?

1251
01:25:36,470 --> 01:25:38,768
No, that's the trouble with me.

1252
01:25:38,939 --> 01:25:43,706
I don't pick them for character.
I'll bet you picked yours for character.

1253
01:25:44,044 --> 01:25:46,444
Yes, in a way.

1254
01:25:46,514 --> 01:25:49,745
Yes, and where did it get you?
On the train for Reno.

1255
01:25:50,551 --> 01:25:52,416
On the train for Reno!

1256
01:25:53,053 --> 01:25:55,851
My way, your marriage
may not last until death...

1257
01:25:55,990 --> 01:25:59,289
...but it's fun while it hangs together.

1258
01:25:59,827 --> 01:26:03,228
I think it's cruel sitting around
waiting for somebody to die.

1259
01:26:03,297 --> 01:26:05,731
- What did you pick yours for?
- Not for character!

1260
01:26:05,799 --> 01:26:10,202
There you are. No matter what
you pick them for, where does it get you?

1261
01:26:10,838 --> 01:26:14,501
- On the train for Reno.
- On the train for Reno!

1262
01:26:14,742 --> 01:26:18,178
Let's all have another drinkie. To Reno!

1263
01:26:18,245 --> 01:26:22,181
The biggest little city in the world,
American cradle of liberty.

1264
01:26:22,316 --> 01:26:25,479
Reno, beautiful emblem of the great divide.

1265
01:26:29,390 --> 01:26:32,484
What's the matter, dearie,
cat got your tongue?

1266
01:26:35,362 --> 01:26:36,522
To Reno.

1267
01:26:40,601 --> 01:26:42,466
''Down on Old Smokey
All covered with snow

1268
01:26:42,836 --> 01:26:45,634
<i>''I</i> lost my true lover
From courting too slow

1269
01:26:47,274 --> 01:26:51,734
''Courting is pleasure
Parting is grief

1270
01:26:51,979 --> 01:26:56,348
''And a false-hearted lover
Is worse than a thief

1271
01:26:56,750 --> 01:27:00,584
''The grave will decay you
And turn you to dust

1272

1273
01:27:05,359 --> 01:27:07,554
- Lucy?
- Hello, honey. How's tricks?

1274
01:27:07,628 --> 01:27:08,856
Where's Mrs. Haines?

1275
01:27:08,929 --> 01:27:12,990
She'll be moseying around pretty soon.
For the six weeks she's been here...

1276
01:27:13,067 --> 01:27:15,797
...she's never been far away
when the mail comes in.

1277
01:27:15,869 --> 01:27:19,896
Wish that man of hers would send her
a letter, a telegram or something.

1278
01:27:19,974 --> 01:27:22,909
Men are all like that. Anything for me?

1279
01:27:22,977 --> 01:27:25,002
Nary a postcard, dearie.

1280
01:27:25,245 --> 01:27:28,180
You'll miss her a lot
when she leaves tomorrow, won't you?

1281
01:27:28,248 --> 01:27:29,613
Yes, I will.

1282
01:27:30,050 --> 01:27:32,314
I ain't finished getting
her packing done yet.

1283
01:27:32,386 --> 01:27:35,480
Come on. You can mope in her room
as well as anywhere else.

1284
01:27:35,889 --> 01:27:38,722
Why didn't you get divorced
this morning with Mrs. Haines?

1285
01:27:38,792 --> 01:27:41,056
I had to wait for some papers
from New York.

1286
01:27:41,161 --> 01:27:42,150
I see.

1287
01:27:42,229 --> 01:27:46,256
Truth to tell, I'll miss Mrs. H., too.
She's about the nicest ever came here.

1288
01:27:46,333 --> 01:27:49,166
- I hate Reno.
- You didn't come for fun.

1289
01:27:49,236 --> 01:27:51,602
''The grave will decay you
And turn you to dust

1290
01:27:51,672 --> 01:27:54,835
''There ain't one boy out of 20
A poor girl can <i>trust''</i>

1291
01:27:55,209 --> 01:27:57,507
You've seen a lot of divorcées,
haven't you?

1292
01:27:57,578 --> 01:27:59,739
Been cooking for them for 10 years.

1293
01:27:59,813 --> 01:28:02,475
- Do you feel sorry for us?
- Ma'am, I don't.

1294
01:28:02,549 --> 01:28:06,041
You feel sorry enough for yourselves.
You ain't got much else to do.

1295
01:28:06,620 --> 01:28:08,554
You've never been married.

1296
01:28:08,622 --> 01:28:09,884
I've had three!

1297
01:28:09,957 --> 01:28:11,117
- Husbands?
- Kids.

1298
01:28:12,426 --> 01:28:14,792
Then you're probably very happy.

1299
01:28:15,095 --> 01:28:18,758
Good gracious, ma'am, I stopped
thinking about being happy long ago.

1300
01:28:18,832 --> 01:28:23,292
- You don't think about being happy?
- Ain't had the time with the kids and all.

1301
01:28:23,370 --> 01:28:25,634
The old man's such a demon
when he's drinking.

1302
01:28:25,706 --> 01:28:29,403
Them big, strong,
red-headed men, they're fierce.

1303
01:28:30,444 --> 01:28:32,469
He beat you! How terrible!

1304
01:28:32,613 --> 01:28:35,275
Yes, when you think
that a lot of women on the ranch...

1305
01:28:35,349 --> 01:28:37,874
...need a beating worse than I do.

1306
01:28:38,852 --> 01:28:40,820
I'll get Buck to come fix that thing.

1307
01:28:40,888 --> 01:28:44,221
But you live in Reno.
You could get a divorce overnight.

1308
01:28:44,291 --> 01:28:47,692
A woman can't get herself
worked up to a thing like that overnight!

1309
01:28:50,097 --> 01:28:51,462
Hello, Peggy!

1310
01:28:52,199 --> 01:28:56,295
Hi, Countess! You've seen enough.
Let's get out there with the Countess.

1311
01:28:56,870 --> 01:28:58,963
Is Mrs. Haines around?

1312
01:28:59,106 --> 01:29:01,631
No, Countess. But come on in.
She'll be here soon, the mail has come.

1313
01:29:08,115 --> 01:29:12,313
Now she wants to see Mrs. Haines.
I've simply got to see her alone.

1314
01:29:12,786 --> 01:29:15,311
- How are you, dear child?
- All right.

1315
01:29:15,389 --> 01:29:18,085
Did you see the doctor? What did he say?

1316
01:29:18,158 --> 01:29:20,251
He said it was the altitude.

1317
01:29:20,360 --> 01:29:22,988
My dear, you've got
the Reno jumpy-wumpsies.

1318
01:29:23,163 --> 01:29:24,755
Here's a wee juggy.

1319
01:29:24,832 --> 01:29:28,268
- We must celebrate Mrs. Haines' divorce.
- Right you are, Countess.

1320
01:29:28,502 --> 01:29:31,528
Countess, I don't think a divorce
is anything to celebrate.

1321
01:29:31,605 --> 01:29:34,540
''lf the ocean was whiskey
And I was a duck

1322
01:29:34,675 --> 01:29:37,940
''I'd dive to the bottom
And never come up

1323
01:29:38,178 --> 01:29:42,342
''Baby, I've told you before

1324
01:29:42,449 --> 01:29:46,146
''The more I drink whiskey
I love you the <i>more''</i>

1325
01:29:48,188 --> 01:29:49,951
<i>L'amour, I'amour.</i>

1326
01:29:52,259 --> 01:29:54,989
- Have you ever been in love?
- Yes, ma'am.

1327
01:29:55,062 --> 01:29:56,927
Tell us about it.

1328
01:29:57,498 --> 01:30:00,092
Ma'am, ain't much to tell.

1329
01:30:00,734 --> 01:30:02,793
I kind of enjoyed the courting time.

1330
01:30:03,070 --> 01:30:07,131
It was as pretty a sight as you ever saw
to see him come loping across them hills.

1331
01:30:07,207 --> 01:30:10,199
The sky was so big and blue
and that brick top of his...

1332
01:30:10,277 --> 01:30:12,404
...blazing like the bejiggers in the sun.

1333
01:30:12,479 --> 01:30:14,811
Then we'd sit on my back fence and spark.

1334
01:30:14,882 --> 01:30:17,749
Ma'am, you know how them
big, strong red-headed men are.

1335
01:30:17,818 --> 01:30:20,184
They just got to get to the point.

1336
01:30:20,254 --> 01:30:21,915
So we got married, ma'am.

1337
01:30:22,156 --> 01:30:24,989
Naturally, I ain't had no chance
to think about love since.

1338
01:30:25,459 --> 01:30:28,394
Hello, Countess.
How's the rhythm on the range?

1339
01:30:28,462 --> 01:30:30,396
Simply divine, my dear.

1340
01:30:30,464 --> 01:30:33,627
Gallop madly over the sagebrush.

1341
01:30:33,734 --> 01:30:35,725
- Hello, sunshine.
- Hello.

1342
01:30:36,303 --> 01:30:39,238
What you need is a wee drinkie
of this good corn liquor.

1343
01:30:39,306 --> 01:30:41,934
- No, thanks.
- Is that invitation general, Countess?

1344
01:30:42,009 --> 01:30:44,944
Yes, indeedy, as we say on the range.

1345
01:30:45,612 --> 01:30:50,015
Here's to freedom. Day after tomorrow,
I shall be free. Free as a bird.

1346
01:30:50,284 --> 01:30:52,343
That little French buzzard.

1347
01:30:54,188 --> 01:30:56,019
Wither shall I fly?

1348
01:30:56,490 --> 01:30:59,288
To the arms of our pet cowboy, darling.

1349
01:30:59,860 --> 01:31:03,057
- Miriam Aarons!
- Why he's plum loco for you, Countess.

1350
01:31:03,130 --> 01:31:06,463
He likes you even better than his horse,
and it's a blasted big horse.

1351
01:31:06,533 --> 01:31:10,560
Buck Winston is nice.
He's so young and strong.

1352
01:31:10,637 --> 01:31:14,573
Have you noticed
the play of his muscles? Musical!

1353
01:31:14,808 --> 01:31:17,800
You don't mean to say his joints squeak?

1354
01:31:18,612 --> 01:31:21,046
He could crack a coconut
with those knees...

1355
01:31:21,114 --> 01:31:22,979
...if he could get them together.

1356
01:31:23,050 --> 01:31:24,415
Say, Countess...

1357
01:31:26,220 --> 01:31:29,621
...that guy hasn't been arousing
your honorable intentions, has he?

1358
01:31:30,724 --> 01:31:34,125
Yes. But I'm different from the rest of you.

1359
01:31:34,561 --> 01:31:36,995
I've always put my faith in love.

1360
01:31:37,965 --> 01:31:40,957
Still I've had four divorces.
Dare I risk a fifth?

1361
01:31:41,468 --> 01:31:44,562
What are you risking, Countess?
Or maybe I shouldn't ask.

1362
01:31:44,638 --> 01:31:48,540
Alas. I fear I'd never make a success
of Buck at Newport.

1363
01:31:48,609 --> 01:31:51,544
Why not?
They'd have to admit Buck's handsome.

1364
01:31:51,645 --> 01:31:54,443
But if I had your dough,
I'd sell him to the radio first.

1365
01:31:54,514 --> 01:31:55,503
Radio?

1366
01:31:55,582 --> 01:32:00,485
Think of how his voice might sound
cooing over a microphone.

1367
01:32:01,054 --> 01:32:03,522
Dreamily drifting over the ether.

1368
01:32:04,958 --> 01:32:06,323
Why not?

1369
01:32:06,927 --> 01:32:09,293
I'll turn him into a radio star.

1370
01:32:09,997 --> 01:32:12,591
<i>L'amour, I'amour.</i>

1371
01:32:13,567 --> 01:32:17,765
Miriam, when are you going to open up
and tell us your great secret?

1372
01:32:18,338 --> 01:32:20,272
What secret, Countess?

1373
01:32:20,440 --> 01:32:24,501
About the man in your life.
After all, there must be a man.

1374
01:32:26,079 --> 01:32:27,808
I would have spilled before...

1375
01:32:27,881 --> 01:32:31,840
...but I found out that his wife's
a friend of our palsy-walsy's.

1376
01:32:32,519 --> 01:32:33,781
Who is it? Tell me.

1377
01:32:33,854 --> 01:32:37,449
- Ever hear them speak of Sylvia Fowler?
- Yes, I think so.

1378
01:32:38,258 --> 01:32:41,056
It's the dame's husband, Howard Fowler.

1379
01:32:41,929 --> 01:32:43,157
How sweet!

1380
01:32:43,230 --> 01:32:45,790
Yeah, and all he had to do
to get rid of her was...

1381
01:32:45,866 --> 01:32:47,163
You got the jackpot!

1382
01:32:47,968 --> 01:32:49,230
Hello, girls.

1383
01:32:49,303 --> 01:32:51,999
- Hello, babe. How does it feel to be free?
- Great.

1384
01:32:52,072 --> 01:32:54,438
- You lie.
- Have it your own way.

1385
01:32:54,508 --> 01:32:56,840
Mary, could I see you for a minute?

1386
01:32:56,910 --> 01:32:59,572
Certainly, dear.
As my last official act in Reno...

1387
01:32:59,646 --> 01:33:02,911
...l'm going to prepare the supper
with my own little hands.

1388
01:33:02,983 --> 01:33:05,713
- Lucy, any mail?
- Here it is, my lady.

1389
01:33:07,521 --> 01:33:09,182
It's from Edith.

1390
01:33:09,389 --> 01:33:13,519
- Can't mistake that childish handwriting.
- Coming! Reckon that's the new boarder.

1391
01:33:13,593 --> 01:33:16,721
Just got in on the afternoon train
from New York.

1392
01:33:18,966 --> 01:33:20,092
Listen to this:

1393
01:33:20,167 --> 01:33:24,297
''Dear Mary, the stork has just delivered
Phelps and me another female! <i>''</i>

1394
01:33:24,371 --> 01:33:26,601
Good heavens! That makes eight girls.

1395
01:33:26,673 --> 01:33:29,437
Eight little cherubs. How sweet!

1396
01:33:29,509 --> 01:33:33,070
<i>L'amour, I'amour. Toujours I'amour!</i>

1397
01:33:36,049 --> 01:33:38,381
Who the heck is paging <i>I'Amour?</i>

1398
01:33:47,227 --> 01:33:49,821
Here I am, girls. Move over.

1399
01:33:50,464 --> 01:33:52,932
- Where's the porter?
- What's that contraption?

1400
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:54,228
An English saddle.

1401
01:33:54,301 --> 01:33:57,270
I refuse to learn to ride
one of those Western things.

1402
01:33:57,337 --> 01:33:59,669
- Did you ever see a horse laugh?
- Pardon?

1403
01:33:59,740 --> 01:34:01,401
You're going to.

1404
01:34:01,842 --> 01:34:03,867
Here's a letter for you.

1405
01:34:04,578 --> 01:34:08,708
Want to go to your room,
or stay here and dish with your buddies?

1406
01:34:08,882 --> 01:34:10,440
I'll be along.

1407
01:34:13,553 --> 01:34:15,783
<i>- Et tu, Brute?</i>
- Darling.

1408
01:34:16,757 --> 01:34:18,384
What a gathering of the clan.

1409
01:34:18,458 --> 01:34:21,916
- Why didn't you send a wire?
- They told me to put nothing on paper.

1410
01:34:21,995 --> 01:34:23,656
Anyway, here I am.

1411
01:34:24,698 --> 01:34:26,325
Another member of the big roundup?

1412
01:34:26,400 --> 01:34:28,630
This is the Countess De Lave,
Mrs. Howard Fowler.

1413
01:34:28,702 --> 01:34:30,192
How do you do?

1414
01:34:31,271 --> 01:34:33,603
- And Mrs. Aarons.
- How do you do?

1415
01:34:34,141 --> 01:34:35,631
How do you do?

1416
01:34:36,710 --> 01:34:39,042
Howard Fowler,
the man I trusted my life with...

1417
01:34:39,112 --> 01:34:42,047
...has kicked me out for some filthy beezle.

1418
01:34:42,115 --> 01:34:45,107
Don't go, darling. We're all girls together.

1419
01:34:45,552 --> 01:34:48,282
- Pour Mrs. Fowler a little drinkie.
- Okay.

1420
01:34:48,355 --> 01:34:51,017
But he couldn't have kicked you out,
not Howard.

1421
01:34:51,091 --> 01:34:55,425
Is that so? That's all you know about him.
The man's a fiend, an absolute Borgia!

1422
01:34:55,495 --> 01:34:57,429
You wouldn't believe the things he did.

1423
01:34:57,497 --> 01:35:01,558
One day, he picked a quarrel with me,
so I ordered him out of the house.

1424
01:35:01,635 --> 01:35:04,035
He had Dictographs
hidden all over the place.

1425
01:35:04,104 --> 01:35:06,664
And I gave him complete grounds
for incompatibility.

1426
01:35:06,740 --> 01:35:10,198
All recorded on nasty little discs
in the most awful-sounding language.

1427
01:35:10,277 --> 01:35:14,338
Then he told me that if I didn't go to Reno
to divorce him, he'd go to divorce me.

1428
01:35:14,414 --> 01:35:16,541
Divorce me, ruin my reputation!

1429
01:35:16,616 --> 01:35:19,380
- Who is the woman?
- Nobody knows, not even Winchell!

1430
01:35:19,820 --> 01:35:21,845
- Here you are, sister. Buck up!
- Thanks.

1431
01:35:21,922 --> 01:35:24,584
Here's to cupid.
Tomorrow you can start looking around.

1432
01:35:24,658 --> 01:35:27,354
You're right,
I don't intend to sit around and act glum.

1433
01:35:27,427 --> 01:35:29,725
When I think of what
I've sacrificed for him.

1434
01:35:29,796 --> 01:35:32,924
- Such as what, Mrs. Fowler?
- I gave him my youth!

1435
01:35:34,334 --> 01:35:36,359
Air mail, special delivery.

1436
01:35:36,436 --> 01:35:39,303
Probably a bill forwarded to me
by Howard, the skunk!

1437
01:35:39,840 --> 01:35:41,933
It's from Carol Hammond.

1438
01:35:43,977 --> 01:35:46,673
She says Edith Potter's baby
is another catastrophe.

1439
01:35:47,013 --> 01:35:49,743
Looks like Phelps has lungs like a bull.

1440
01:35:55,122 --> 01:35:57,613
There was a clipping in here, where is it?

1441
01:36:03,497 --> 01:36:04,555
Give me that!

1442
01:36:07,134 --> 01:36:08,567
Hey, <i>you...</i>

1443
01:36:09,703 --> 01:36:11,500
Wait a minute, you!

1444
01:36:12,005 --> 01:36:14,872
- Wasn't your name Aarons?
- What's it to you, Mrs. Fowler?

1445
01:36:14,941 --> 01:36:16,602
You stay right where you are!

1446
01:36:17,244 --> 01:36:19,610
''Miriam Aarons is now being Renovated.

1447
01:36:20,046 --> 01:36:22,742
''Three guesses Mrs. Fowler,
as to who she's going to <i>marry.''</i>

1448
01:36:23,850 --> 01:36:25,010
Why, Miriam!

1449
01:36:25,085 --> 01:36:28,646
Why can't those moldy rags
leave a successful divorce alone?

1450
01:36:28,855 --> 01:36:30,652
- Why, you little...
- Now, Sylvia!

1451
01:36:30,724 --> 01:36:31,850
- Did you know?
- No!

1452
01:36:31,925 --> 01:36:33,756
What do you care? You don't love him.

1453
01:36:33,827 --> 01:36:36,489
That is irrelevant.
How much did he settle on you?

1454
01:36:36,563 --> 01:36:38,963
I made Howard pay for what he wants.

1455
01:36:39,032 --> 01:36:41,796
You made him pay
for what he doesn't want.

1456
01:36:41,868 --> 01:36:43,358
Why, you filthy...

1457
01:36:43,436 --> 01:36:45,904
Don't call me names,
you Park Avenue playgirl!

1458
01:36:45,972 --> 01:36:48,497
I know a lot more words than you do.

1459
01:36:49,543 --> 01:36:51,807
Don't you dare strike me,
I've got glasses on!

1460
01:36:51,878 --> 01:36:54,608
- Now you haven't.
- How do you like that?

1461
01:36:57,617 --> 01:37:00,415
Miriam, darling, don't be vulgar!

1462
01:37:03,123 --> 01:37:05,683
My hat! How do you like that?

1463
01:37:06,793 --> 01:37:08,522
My hat! Let me go!

1464
01:37:24,010 --> 01:37:26,376
Pretty well-matched, ain't they?

1465
01:37:28,615 --> 01:37:29,843
Get off of me!

1466
01:37:29,916 --> 01:37:31,178
Do something!

1467
01:37:31,251 --> 01:37:35,654
Leave them enjoy themselves.
I'll get the smelling salts for the loser.

1468
01:37:36,223 --> 01:37:39,522
Take it easy, Mrs. Fowler.
I'm only trying to help in my own way.

1469
01:37:39,593 --> 01:37:41,060
You big moose!

1470
01:37:42,662 --> 01:37:43,788
She's a cuckoo.

1471
01:37:51,471 --> 01:37:54,269
- Who's got iodine?
- In my bathroom. Help her, Peggy.

1472
01:37:54,341 --> 01:37:56,434
I've got to be careful of hydrophobia.

1473
01:38:00,080 --> 01:38:02,947
Mary, how could you let her do that to me?

1474
01:38:03,216 --> 01:38:04,478
Forget it.

1475
01:38:04,551 --> 01:38:08,282
You're on her side! My own cousin.
And after all I've done for you.

1476
01:38:08,355 --> 01:38:11,051
- Just what have you done for me?
- I warned you.

1477
01:38:11,124 --> 01:38:13,285
I'm not exactly grateful for that.

1478
01:38:13,360 --> 01:38:15,521
You're getting exactly what you deserved.

1479
01:38:15,595 --> 01:38:18,928
Plenty of the girls are tickled to death!
I hate you!

1480
01:38:18,999 --> 01:38:23,402
I hate everybody!

1481
01:38:23,637 --> 01:38:27,164
- Listen, Mrs. Fowler, you got the hysterics!
- You wait!

1482
01:38:27,274 --> 01:38:31,540
Someday you'll need a girlfriend,
then you'll think of your treachery to me!

1483
01:38:35,215 --> 01:38:36,682
Poor creatures.

1484
01:38:37,017 --> 01:38:41,420
They've lost their equilibrium
because they've lost their faith in love.

1485
01:38:42,322 --> 01:38:44,347
<i>L'amour, I'amour.</i>

1486
01:38:44,491 --> 01:38:48,359
<i>''A</i> man can ride a horse to the range above

1487
01:38:48,561 --> 01:38:52,190
''But a woman has to ride
on the wings of <i>love''</i>

1488
01:38:57,170 --> 01:39:00,435
A nice little bout between
a couple of lady palookas.

1489
01:39:00,540 --> 01:39:02,201
Right. We're really a couple of cats.

1490
01:39:03,510 --> 01:39:06,001
- Did you want to see me, Peggy?
- Yes.

1491
01:39:06,680 --> 01:39:08,875
I'm going to have a baby.

1492
01:39:11,918 --> 01:39:13,749
What shall I do?

1493
01:39:14,054 --> 01:39:17,717
Darling! Don't cry.

1494
01:39:19,059 --> 01:39:22,222
- That's splendid.
- Okay, baby!

1495
01:39:22,495 --> 01:39:27,159
- What's John's telephone number?
- Eldorado 53598.

1496
01:39:27,267 --> 01:39:31,567
- Wait a minute. What is it?
- Eldorado 53598.

1497
01:39:32,806 --> 01:39:36,435
- I can't tell him.
- Why not? Isn't he old enough to know?

1498
01:39:36,876 --> 01:39:38,241
Long distance, please.

1499
01:39:38,311 --> 01:39:42,543
I always wanted a baby,
but what can I do with it now?

1500
01:39:42,749 --> 01:39:46,378
- You can enter it for Harvard.
- Or land it with the Marines.

1501
01:39:46,519 --> 01:39:49,181
New York. Eldorado <i>359...</i>

1502
01:39:49,622 --> 01:39:52,887
53598.

1503
01:39:53,126 --> 01:39:55,594
I can't tell him.
I wouldn't know how to begin.

1504
01:39:55,662 --> 01:39:57,493
You'll know when you hear his voice.

1505
01:39:57,564 --> 01:40:00,965
It's no use.
You don't know the things he said to me.

1506
01:40:01,167 --> 01:40:02,896
I have my pride.

1507
01:40:03,169 --> 01:40:06,502
Reno's full of women
who have their pride, sweetheart.

1508
01:40:06,573 --> 01:40:10,304
It's a pretty chilly exchange
for the guy you're stuck on.

1509
01:40:10,443 --> 01:40:12,775
Mr. Day, please. Reno calling.

1510
01:40:13,313 --> 01:40:15,110
Mr. Day? Just a minute.

1511
01:40:15,181 --> 01:40:18,014
Suffering Saints!
That guy must live by the phone.

1512
01:40:18,084 --> 01:40:19,312
Johnny?

1513
01:40:22,188 --> 01:40:26,124
Hello. No, I'm not sick.

1514
01:40:28,762 --> 01:40:30,753
I'm all right, <i>but...</i>

1515
01:40:31,164 --> 01:40:34,133
I'm going to have a baby.

1516
01:40:39,038 --> 01:40:40,733
Darling, are you?

1517
01:40:42,375 --> 01:40:43,967
Darling, do you?

1518
01:40:44,778 --> 01:40:46,769
Darling, so do I.

1519
01:40:50,550 --> 01:40:51,812
So do I.

1520
01:40:52,685 --> 01:40:54,949
Of course I forgive you.

1521
01:40:55,822 --> 01:41:00,282
Yes, precious.
Yes, lamb, on the very next train.

1522
01:41:08,768 --> 01:41:11,362
Do you mind if I reverse the charges?

1523
01:41:13,907 --> 01:41:15,636
Goodbye, precious.

1524
01:41:29,122 --> 01:41:31,716
Don't expect me for dinner.
I've got to pack.

1525
01:41:31,791 --> 01:41:32,348
What happened?

1526
01:41:33,159 --> 01:41:36,686
When I get back I'm going to do
everything John says.

1527
01:41:37,397 --> 01:41:38,523
Good.

1528
01:41:38,631 --> 01:41:40,758
I'm so happy, I could cry.

1529
01:41:44,037 --> 01:41:47,837
Listen, sister, when are you going
to get wise to yourself?

1530
01:41:48,875 --> 01:41:50,775
- Who, me?
- Yeah, you.

1531
01:41:52,612 --> 01:41:56,241
- Why, I was divorced this morning.
- A Reno divorce.

1532
01:42:04,724 --> 01:42:07,318
No, Operator, we completed that call.

1533
01:42:13,900 --> 01:42:15,492
Listen to me.

1534
01:42:15,935 --> 01:42:18,665
There's nothing you could say
that I haven't heard.

1535
01:42:18,738 --> 01:42:21,172
Sure? Maybe I got a new slant.

1536
01:42:21,407 --> 01:42:26,242
I come from a world where a woman's got
to come out on top or it's too darn bad.

1537
01:42:26,312 --> 01:42:31,215
Talk to me all you want.
What does it come to? Compromise.

1538
01:42:31,351 --> 01:42:34,946
What the heck! A woman is
compromised the day she's born.

1539
01:42:36,222 --> 01:42:38,747
Can't compromise with utter defeat.

1540
01:42:39,659 --> 01:42:41,126
He doesn't want me.

1541
01:42:41,194 --> 01:42:44,960
- How do you know?
- I've waited every day to hear from him.

1542
01:42:45,365 --> 01:42:48,027
- Did you write to him?
- Of course not.

1543
01:42:48,468 --> 01:42:51,335
How do you know
he hasn't been waiting, too?

1544
01:42:52,105 --> 01:42:55,233
Listen, honey,
I've been through all this before.

1545
01:42:55,575 --> 01:42:57,509
I lost my man, too.

1546
01:42:57,777 --> 01:42:58,766
You?

1547
01:42:58,845 --> 01:43:01,643
It only happened once.
Got wise to myself after that.

1548
01:43:01,714 --> 01:43:03,841
How did I lose him?

1549
01:43:04,284 --> 01:43:08,186
We didn't have enough dough
to get married and I <i>wouldn't...</i>

1550
01:43:08,588 --> 01:43:11,614
I had my pride.
Heaven knows where I got it.

1551
01:43:12,625 --> 01:43:15,526
I liked him a lot better
than I've ever liked anybody since.

1552
01:43:15,595 --> 01:43:18,325
One day, my Romeo took
a little walkout on me.

1553
01:43:18,398 --> 01:43:20,662
I made a terrible row. Why shouldn't I?

1554
01:43:20,733 --> 01:43:23,361
But what I ought not to have done
was to run away...

1555
01:43:23,436 --> 01:43:26,564
...and leave him in the clutches
of that woman, like a coward.

1556
01:43:26,639 --> 01:43:30,336
That's what you are, Mary Haines,
you're a blithering coward.

1557
01:43:32,745 --> 01:43:33,871
Why?

1558
01:43:35,515 --> 01:43:37,642
Because I wouldn't stay
to be second fiddle?

1559
01:43:37,717 --> 01:43:41,244
Because you ran out of the trenches
under fire. You deserted him.

1560
01:43:41,321 --> 01:43:43,915
- I deserted him?
- Sure you did.

1561
01:43:43,990 --> 01:43:47,653
You think he wants to be
in the grip of that red-headed octopus?

1562
01:43:47,727 --> 01:43:51,993
If you'd given him a chance,
he'd have asked you not to get a divorce.

1563
01:43:52,865 --> 01:43:55,026
Why, Miriam, he did ask me.

1564
01:43:55,435 --> 01:43:58,233
- And you still ran away?
- Yes.

1565
01:43:59,606 --> 01:44:02,268
One, two, three, four, five, six,
seven, eight, nine.

1566
01:44:02,342 --> 01:44:05,937
Listen, honey, don't you know
that we dames have got to be...

1567
01:44:06,012 --> 01:44:09,311
...a lot more to the guy we marry
than a schoolgirl sweetheart?

1568
01:44:09,382 --> 01:44:14,081
We got to be a wife.
And a mother, and a pal.

1569
01:44:14,253 --> 01:44:15,982
And a nursemaid.

1570
01:44:16,556 --> 01:44:20,492
Sometimes, when it comes to the point,
we've even got to be a cutie.

1571
01:44:20,560 --> 01:44:24,690
You should have licked that girl
where she licked you, in his arms.

1572
01:44:24,831 --> 01:44:27,061
That's where you win in the first round.

1573
01:44:27,133 --> 01:44:30,296
And if I know men,
it's still Custer's Last Stand.

1574
01:44:31,037 --> 01:44:32,197
Shocked you?

1575
01:44:32,271 --> 01:44:37,072
Okay, sister, but my idea of love
is that love isn't ashamed of nothing.

1576
01:44:37,143 --> 01:44:41,011
That's easy enough to say, Miriam,
but that girl's in his blood.

1577
01:44:41,714 --> 01:44:44,945
I couldn't have stayed under the same roof
with him and faced that.

1578
01:44:45,018 --> 01:44:47,680
Why not? Suppose the guy had smallpox.

1579
01:44:47,754 --> 01:44:51,520
Would you had liked to have faced that?
But you'd have done it.

1580
01:44:51,591 --> 01:44:56,153
This jam that he's in would make
a bad case of smallpox look like a carnival.

1581
01:44:56,229 --> 01:44:58,789
While the poor guy's
floundering around helpless...

1582
01:44:58,865 --> 01:45:02,130
...you remove the one protection he's got,
his legal marriage.

1583
01:45:02,201 --> 01:45:05,830
So he's stumbling around in the open,
delirious and unprotected...

1584
01:45:05,905 --> 01:45:08,601
...with a she-wolf in lamb's clothing
right on his heels.

1585
01:45:09,042 --> 01:45:10,873
And not one word of comfort out of you.

1586
01:45:10,943 --> 01:45:13,935
Because why? Because you're too busy
nursing your two-for-a-nickel pride.

1587
01:45:15,548 --> 01:45:19,848
Operator, we <i>completed...</i>
It's New York calling Mrs. Haines?

1588
01:45:23,222 --> 01:45:24,883
It's Mr. Haines?

1589
01:45:25,892 --> 01:45:30,556
Tell him you'll tear that divorce decree
into a million pieces and use it for confetti.

1590
01:45:34,567 --> 01:45:36,057
Hello, Stephen.

1591
01:45:39,072 --> 01:45:41,267
It's so good to hear your voice.

1592
01:45:44,477 --> 01:45:47,969
Yes, it went through on schedule
this morning.

1593
01:45:48,948 --> 01:45:50,677
But I can still...

1594
01:45:52,719 --> 01:45:54,311
But, Stephen...

1595
01:45:55,655 --> 01:45:56,644
No.

1596
01:45:57,957 --> 01:46:01,154
I haven't seen the papers.
How could I up here?

1597
01:46:14,707 --> 01:46:15,765
Yes.

1598
01:46:17,510 --> 01:46:19,478
I'd rather you told me.

1599
01:46:22,415 --> 01:46:23,882
Of course.

1600
01:46:25,485 --> 01:46:28,010
I understand the position you're in.

1601
01:46:34,627 --> 01:46:37,391
I hope you'll both be very happy.

1602
01:46:40,633 --> 01:46:45,536
Me? No, I have no plans.

1603
01:46:47,406 --> 01:46:49,033
No plans at all.

1604
01:46:53,513 --> 01:46:55,606
Do you mind if I hang up now?

1605
01:46:57,049 --> 01:46:59,711
Goodbye, Stephen.

1606
01:47:02,388 --> 01:47:04,447
He married her, didn't he?

1607
01:47:05,725 --> 01:47:06,749
Yes.

1608
01:47:08,594 --> 01:47:10,255
This afternoon.

1609
01:47:15,201 --> 01:47:17,761
I'm sorry I spoke so rough to you.

1610
01:47:18,738 --> 01:47:20,672
It's all right, sister.

1611
01:47:22,375 --> 01:47:24,036
It was a nice try.

1612
01:47:31,617 --> 01:47:35,610
I don't know what I'm kicking about.
I still have my pride.

1613
01:47:38,558 --> 01:47:41,322
Don't cry, honey.

1614
01:47:43,362 --> 01:47:45,796
Come on, buck up.

1615
01:48:01,447 --> 01:48:04,382
But <i>Madame</i> has been soaking
one whole hour.

1616
01:48:04,817 --> 01:48:06,751
- So what?
<i>- Monsieur</i> thinks that...

1617
01:48:06,819 --> 01:48:10,619
I told <i>Monsieur</i> the doctor ordered me
to soak in this foam for my nerves.

1618
01:48:10,690 --> 01:48:12,419
What do you want?

1619
01:48:12,491 --> 01:48:14,652
<i>Monsieur</i> suggests that you join him...

1620
01:48:14,727 --> 01:48:17,252
...and walk Little Mary
to her mother's apartment.

1621
01:48:17,330 --> 01:48:22,097
Holy mackerel, what a cheerful evening!
I'm so bored!

1622
01:48:22,902 --> 01:48:25,063
<i>Monsieur</i> says that it doesn't improve...

1623
01:48:25,137 --> 01:48:27,537
<i>...Madame's</i> nerves
to stay so long in the water.

1624
01:48:27,607 --> 01:48:30,235
What'd he mean by that? A crack?

1625
01:48:30,610 --> 01:48:32,942
No, he did not say it that way, <i>Madame.</i>

1626
01:48:34,380 --> 01:48:35,540
I thought not.

1627
01:48:35,615 --> 01:48:39,847
I've been Mrs. Haines for 18 months now
without a single squawk.

1628
01:48:39,952 --> 01:48:43,012
That's some sort of a record
for Park Avenue.

1629
01:48:43,990 --> 01:48:44,979
Get out.

1630
01:48:45,358 --> 01:48:47,019
Get out! Go on!

1631
01:48:49,595 --> 01:48:51,085
Hello, you.

1632
01:48:52,531 --> 01:48:54,396
No, I'm in the tub.

1633
01:48:55,635 --> 01:48:59,366
Yeah, and I'm shriveled to a peanut
waiting for this call.

1634
01:49:00,172 --> 01:49:02,640
And say, listen,
don't call me anymore today.

1635
01:49:02,708 --> 01:49:06,542
If there's any calling to be done,
I'll call you. It's safer.

1636
01:49:06,746 --> 01:49:07,735
I know.

1637
01:49:07,813 --> 01:49:11,374
When I had this phone put in here,
I thought I'd have a little privacy...

1638
01:49:11,450 --> 01:49:16,410
...but the way people barge in and out,
you'd think it was Grand Central Station.

1639
01:49:17,590 --> 01:49:18,750
What?

1640
01:49:20,760 --> 01:49:24,491
Maybe it's a good thing
you're going to the Coast tomorrow.

1641
01:49:24,897 --> 01:49:27,559
It's getting to be too risky.

1642
01:49:29,902 --> 01:49:31,301
Say, listen.

1643
01:49:31,604 --> 01:49:35,904
I've worked too hard to land
this meal ticket to make any false moves.

1644
01:49:37,009 --> 01:49:38,374
Romance?

1645
01:49:38,978 --> 01:49:41,412
Peace is a whole lot more to me
than any romance.

1646
01:49:41,480 --> 01:49:45,007
They're not going to get me
out on that limb again, ever!

1647
01:49:46,252 --> 01:49:47,583
What?

1648
01:49:50,289 --> 01:49:51,756
Sure, I'll miss you, baby.

1649
01:49:52,358 --> 01:49:54,952
I'll miss you like nobody's business.

1650
01:49:55,594 --> 01:49:57,528
I'll say, we had fun.

1651
01:49:59,198 --> 01:50:00,995
I'll call you back.

1652
01:50:03,536 --> 01:50:05,094
Who told you to come in here?

1653
01:50:05,438 --> 01:50:09,272
Daddy. He's going to take me home now,
and I want to say good night.

1654
01:50:09,342 --> 01:50:10,741
Don't go, darling.

1655
01:50:12,945 --> 01:50:15,311
Hand me that sponge there, will you?

1656
01:50:15,481 --> 01:50:17,608
- Please?
- Please.

1657
01:50:21,320 --> 01:50:22,446
Good night.

1658
01:50:22,521 --> 01:50:25,388
You're in a hurry to tell Daddy about it,
aren't you?

1659
01:50:25,458 --> 01:50:27,949
- About what?
- My talk on the telephone.

1660
01:50:28,027 --> 01:50:30,860
I don't understand
grownups on the telephone.

1661
01:50:30,930 --> 01:50:34,263
- They all sound silly. Good night.
- Good night, who?

1662
01:50:38,671 --> 01:50:41,538
You've been told to call me Auntie Crystal.

1663
01:50:41,974 --> 01:50:44,636
- Won't you do it?
- Yes.

1664
01:50:45,344 --> 01:50:46,709
Yes, what?

1665
01:50:47,646 --> 01:50:50,206
- Yes, good night.
- You sit down there.

1666
01:50:51,517 --> 01:50:53,542
It's hot in here. I've got my coat on.

1667
01:50:53,886 --> 01:50:56,878
You heard me, young lady.
I said, ''Sit <i>down''!</i>

1668
01:50:57,723 --> 01:51:01,124
Now, we're going to have this out,
once and for all.

1669
01:51:02,828 --> 01:51:06,423
I've done my best to be friends with you,
but you refuse to cooperate.

1670
01:51:06,499 --> 01:51:08,660
- What?
- Cooperate!

1671
01:51:10,636 --> 01:51:14,197
Now, answer my question.
You don't like me. Why?

1672
01:51:17,176 --> 01:51:19,838
- Good night, Crystal.
- I said, ''Why? <i>''</i>

1673
01:51:21,213 --> 01:51:24,478
Crystal, my mother told me
I wasn't to be rude to you.

1674
01:51:24,850 --> 01:51:28,411
Young lady, you're going to give me
one good reason why you don't like me.

1675
01:51:28,988 --> 01:51:30,683
I never said I didn't like you.

1676
01:51:30,756 --> 01:51:34,283
- But you don't like me, do you?
- No, but I never said so.

1677
01:51:34,560 --> 01:51:38,121
I've been very polite,
considering you're something awful.

1678
01:51:38,464 --> 01:51:40,762
Wait until your father hears about this!

1679
01:51:41,767 --> 01:51:45,328
Listen, Daddy doesn't think
you're so wonderful anymore.

1680
01:51:46,105 --> 01:51:49,734
- Did he tell you that?
- No. He always pretends you're all right.

1681
01:51:49,809 --> 01:51:53,267
You wouldn't know about such things,
but my Daddy is a gentleman.

1682
01:51:53,345 --> 01:51:56,337
He never talks against any woman,
not even you.

1683
01:51:56,415 --> 01:52:00,818
But we understand, Daddy and I,
without ever saying a word to each other.

1684
01:52:00,886 --> 01:52:03,411
I bet you've done plenty
of blabbing to your mother.

1685
01:52:03,489 --> 01:52:07,550
No, I haven't. It's my job
to try and make Mother feel cheerful.

1686
01:52:08,561 --> 01:52:11,553
Go on, get out of here.
Scram! On your way!

1687
01:52:12,898 --> 01:52:17,062
And another thing. I think this bathroom
is perfectly ridiculous!

1688
01:52:17,136 --> 01:52:18,967
Good night, Crystal.

1689
01:52:20,573 --> 01:52:22,097
Why, <i>you...</i>

1690
01:52:25,845 --> 01:52:27,437
I told you not to call me back here again.

1691
01:52:27,513 --> 01:52:29,310
It's too dangerous.

1692
01:52:29,582 --> 01:52:32,380
That little Haines brat was just in here.

1693
01:52:32,852 --> 01:52:35,412
You've been drinking. Yes, you have!

1694
01:52:35,488 --> 01:52:39,424
You're all lit up or you wouldn't want me
to be taking any chances either.

1695
01:52:39,492 --> 01:52:42,188
- May I come in?
- Just a minute, Sylvia.

1696
01:52:43,262 --> 01:52:44,524
Here comes more trouble.

1697
01:52:44,597 --> 01:52:49,296
I'm going to hang up and don't you dare
call me here again! Do you understand?

1698
01:52:51,070 --> 01:52:52,196
Come in, dear.

1699
01:52:53,873 --> 01:52:56,103
I was out in the open when you called.

1700
01:52:56,175 --> 01:52:59,110
- I hope you'll forgive me for being modest.
- You? Modest?

1701
01:52:59,178 --> 01:53:03,114
I'll tell that to my psychoanalyst.
I have to tell him everything!

1702
01:53:03,182 --> 01:53:05,343
That must be a great effort.

1703
01:53:05,985 --> 01:53:08,010
I don't mind talking about myself...

1704
01:53:08,087 --> 01:53:11,386
...but discussing my friends
does make me feel disloyal.

1705
01:53:11,457 --> 01:53:14,221
I just saw poor Stephen
leaving with Little Mary.

1706
01:53:14,293 --> 01:53:16,727
He looked awfully tired and worn.

1707
01:53:16,829 --> 01:53:19,525
Dr. Sylvester says
Stephen has a guilt complex.

1708
01:53:21,367 --> 01:53:22,527
A what?

1709
01:53:22,735 --> 01:53:25,431
- Want me to scrub your back a bit, dear?
- Yeah.

1710
01:53:25,971 --> 01:53:27,370
Here, hold this.

1711
01:53:27,573 --> 01:53:29,939
Dr. Sylvester says that men like Steve
can't admit...

1712
01:53:30,009 --> 01:53:32,239
...what they feel for a woman is not love.

1713
01:53:32,311 --> 01:53:34,142
- You're taking my skin off!
- Sorry.

1714
01:53:34,213 --> 01:53:36,272
He says that's why Stephen married you.

1715
01:53:36,348 --> 01:53:40,284
To convince himself that your friendship
had dignity and importance.

1716
01:53:40,352 --> 01:53:43,412
Who are you to laugh?
I've made good with my husband.

1717
01:53:43,489 --> 01:53:45,684
That's how you talk
after all I've done for you?

1718
01:53:45,758 --> 01:53:46,884
Done what?

1719
01:53:46,959 --> 01:53:48,756
You knew no one
when you married Stephen.

1720
01:53:48,827 --> 01:53:52,456
- It wasn't easy to put you over.
- And who said you put me over?

1721
01:53:52,531 --> 01:53:54,795
I've gotten you into some
of our very best homes!

1722
01:53:54,867 --> 01:53:57,665
Yes, for some of their very best insults.

1723
01:54:02,007 --> 01:54:02,996
What?

1724
01:54:03,075 --> 01:54:06,169
Who was Mrs. Buck Winston
before she married Buck Winston?

1725
01:54:06,245 --> 01:54:10,841
<i>La Comtesse</i> De Lave. Imagine giving up
a title to marry that cowhand.

1726
01:54:10,950 --> 01:54:13,680
I laugh every time I think
she got him into radio.

1727
01:54:13,752 --> 01:54:16,619
My dear, he's positively
the chambermaid's delight!

1728
01:54:18,057 --> 01:54:19,081
Is he?

1729
01:54:19,358 --> 01:54:21,656
Mrs. Potter is on the phone
for you, Mrs. Fowler.

1730
01:54:21,727 --> 01:54:23,558
I'll take it in here.

1731
01:54:26,131 --> 01:54:28,326
But it's on the other phone, <i>Madame.</i>

1732
01:54:28,500 --> 01:54:29,831
Other phone?

1733
01:54:30,903 --> 01:54:33,531
That charming little instrument
is not an extension?

1734
01:54:33,606 --> 01:54:36,734
Stephen does so much business on
the other phone, I got my own.

1735
01:54:36,809 --> 01:54:39,437
I'll bet that Stephen thinks
it's an extension.

1736
01:54:39,511 --> 01:54:41,706
Stephen doesn't mooch
around my bathroom.

1737
01:54:41,847 --> 01:54:45,408
- That's pretty obvious.
- Go on, answer the telephone.

1738
01:54:46,518 --> 01:54:48,679
Tell her I'll call her back.

1739
01:54:52,491 --> 01:54:55,221
Why, you sly little fox, you!

1740
01:54:55,294 --> 01:54:58,525
This settles a question that's been
on my mind from the beginning.

1741
01:54:58,597 --> 01:55:01,589
- What do you mean?
- You put that in here to talk to a man.

1742
01:55:01,667 --> 01:55:03,225
- Don't be ridiculous!
- Don't lie!

1743
01:55:03,302 --> 01:55:06,635
You're not Stephen's type.
I don't know why he picked you up.

1744
01:55:06,705 --> 01:55:10,072
I've got to take a shower.
Wait for me in my bedroom.

1745
01:55:12,344 --> 01:55:15,177
I used this cream. It brought out a rash.

1746
01:55:15,781 --> 01:55:20,115
Don't you dare touch that telephone!
Give me that phone!

1747
01:55:23,355 --> 01:55:25,050
What did he say?

1748
01:55:25,624 --> 01:55:29,890
Not a thing. Not a single thing.
He was singing!

1749
01:55:29,962 --> 01:55:31,691
All right. So what?

1750
01:55:38,837 --> 01:55:40,270
How could you?

1751
01:55:40,339 --> 01:55:44,400
Buck Winston, the chambermaid's delight!

1752
01:55:45,444 --> 01:55:49,380
You haven't got a thing on me,
Sylvia Fowler. Not a single thing!

1753
01:55:49,581 --> 01:55:53,176
Do I care? I'm mum as an oyster.
I don't want Stephen to find out.

1754
01:55:53,252 --> 01:55:55,345
It would give Mary too much satisfaction.

1755
01:55:55,421 --> 01:55:58,356
If you hang on to Stephen,
we'll both be happy.

1756
01:55:58,457 --> 01:56:00,550
- Will you shake on that?
- Why not?

1757
01:56:02,695 --> 01:56:03,218
Is the coast clear?

1758
01:56:03,295 --> 01:56:06,492
All clear, Mrs. Morehead.
They're having a very gay dinner party.

1759
01:56:08,033 --> 01:56:10,524
I'm still glad I went to the movies.
I'm starving. Those dreadful women!

1760
01:56:10,602 --> 01:56:13,264
How my daughter can tolerate them,
I'll never understand.

1761
01:56:13,339 --> 01:56:17,173
Mrs. Haines cooked for them in Reno,
the night she got her divorce, so she...

1762
01:56:17,242 --> 01:56:19,506
So she feels she has to feed them annually.

1763
01:56:19,578 --> 01:56:21,671
Did they bring
the same husbands this time?

1764
01:56:21,747 --> 01:56:25,513
I guess so. They couldn't all
very well get new ones in two years.

1765
01:56:25,584 --> 01:56:29,680
The approach of the innocents.
I leave you my share of them, Jane.

1766
01:56:31,857 --> 01:56:34,291
Miriam, how's matrimony?
Still making a go of it?

1767
01:56:34,360 --> 01:56:36,954
My reconstruction job
on Howard Fowler would make...

1768
01:56:37,029 --> 01:56:39,554
...the Boulder Dam look like an egg cup.

1769
01:56:39,631 --> 01:56:43,829
Can't we get off to the Casino Roof?
Johnny and I have to be home by 4:00.

1770
01:56:43,902 --> 01:56:47,861
Little Johnny always wakes up.
He said the cutest thing the other day.

1771
01:56:48,073 --> 01:56:49,597
He said, ''Dada.''

1772
01:56:49,675 --> 01:56:51,802
When does he enter college?

1773
01:56:52,344 --> 01:56:55,040
- Where's Flora?
- She's at the bar, drinking with the men.

1774
01:56:55,114 --> 01:56:56,911
Tell her you want to get going.

1775
01:56:56,982 --> 01:57:00,611
What's the hurry? One more drink
and Flora will float up on her own breath.

1776
01:57:00,686 --> 01:57:03,553
Do you want to hear something
about Sylvia?

1777
01:57:03,756 --> 01:57:07,123
She's going to that new psychoanalyst.
You know, Dr. Sylvester.

1778
01:57:07,192 --> 01:57:10,787
- Why, he's a dreadful fake!
- Isn't it a scream? She's mad about him!

1779
01:57:10,863 --> 01:57:13,661
Do you know what she pays an hour
just to drool at him?

1780
01:57:13,732 --> 01:57:16,326
- $100.
- It's worth $1 million!

1781
01:57:16,402 --> 01:57:18,427
You should make up with Sylvia.

1782
01:57:18,504 --> 01:57:20,938
She's livid at how
you've high-hatted her since Reno.

1783
01:57:21,006 --> 01:57:23,167
I'd rather have her for a friend
than an enemy.

1784
01:57:23,242 --> 01:57:24,641
I wouldn't.

1785
01:57:25,611 --> 01:57:30,071
<i>Quelle soirée!</i> What a lovely party!

1786
01:57:31,950 --> 01:57:36,944
Isn't it wonderful to see all our lives
so settled, temporarily?

1787
01:57:37,122 --> 01:57:40,250
Do put that poor darling Freddy
out of his misery.

1788
01:57:40,426 --> 01:57:42,792
- How, shoot him?
- Marry him, dear.

1789
01:57:42,861 --> 01:57:44,385
<i>L'amour, I'amour.</i>

1790
01:57:44,463 --> 01:57:47,762
- I'll get your wrap. Which one?
- I don't think I'll be going.

1791
01:57:47,833 --> 01:57:49,664
But why?

1792
01:57:50,636 --> 01:57:54,197
You're not cross because my Buck's
had a wee drop too much?

1793
01:57:54,273 --> 01:57:57,299
Don't be modest, Flora.
Your ducky is stinko.

1794
01:57:57,476 --> 01:58:00,104
Do come. This is really our farewell party.

1795
01:58:00,179 --> 01:58:04,206
- I'm never coming back to New York.
- What's wrong with New York?

1796
01:58:04,483 --> 01:58:07,680
- Can I trust you?
- Probably not, dear. What is it?

1797
01:58:13,859 --> 01:58:16,555
Can we keep this between the five of us?

1798
01:58:17,262 --> 01:58:20,754
- The six of us.
- Shoot. It's a nationwide hookup.

1799
01:58:21,567 --> 01:58:25,503
You remember the way Buck
was always crooning love songs in my ear?

1800
01:58:25,571 --> 01:58:26,936
He doesn't do it anymore.

1801
01:58:27,005 --> 01:58:29,269
Maybe he's saving himself
for the microphone.

1802
01:58:29,341 --> 01:58:32,208
No, he isn't. He stays away
from home most of the time...

1803
01:58:32,277 --> 01:58:35,110
...and comes back smelling
of some strange perfume.

1804
01:58:35,180 --> 01:58:38,638
- Where does he say he's been?
- Visiting his horse.

1805
01:58:39,318 --> 01:58:41,616
That's why it's safer
to keep floating around.

1806
01:58:41,687 --> 01:58:44,212
- Poor Flora.
- Never mind, dear. Chin up!

1807
01:58:44,923 --> 01:58:47,084
That's right, both of them.

1808
01:58:47,759 --> 01:58:49,693
Good night.

1809
01:58:49,761 --> 01:58:54,357
I went up against a tribe of headhunters
in Africa, so I can take anything.

1810
01:58:55,367 --> 01:58:56,800
Good night, precious.

1811
01:58:56,869 --> 01:58:59,394
Since you're not going, I can tell you.

1812
01:58:59,471 --> 01:59:02,804
You'd have run right smack
into Stephen and Crystal and Sylvia.

1813
01:59:02,875 --> 01:59:05,241
They're having supper at the Casino Roof.

1814
01:59:05,310 --> 01:59:08,108
- You'd have let it happen?
- They've got to meet sometime.

1815
01:59:08,180 --> 01:59:12,116
- Why not get it over with?
- You know Mary hates situations.

1816
01:59:12,184 --> 01:59:13,515
I'm not so squeamish.

1817
01:59:13,585 --> 01:59:18,818
Wait till you see the cooing fest I put on
over Howard for dear, darling little Sylvia.

1818
01:59:19,057 --> 01:59:21,651
Good night, Mary darling.

1819
01:59:21,727 --> 01:59:24,662
I don't feel very much like going myself.
I hate this dress.

1820
01:59:24,730 --> 01:59:27,790
My husband says I look
as though I were going to sing in it.

1821
01:59:27,866 --> 01:59:30,994
- Good night.
- My love to little Johnny.

1822
01:59:31,069 --> 01:59:34,300
So long, darling.
Shall I spit in Crystal's eye for you?

1823
01:59:34,373 --> 01:59:38,935
You're passing up a swell chance, honey.
Where I spit, no grass grows ever!

1824
01:59:47,586 --> 01:59:49,713
- What are you doing?
- Fumigating!

1825
01:59:50,055 --> 01:59:51,079
Mother.

1826
01:59:51,390 --> 01:59:55,087
How do you stand those dreadful women,
even once a year?

1827
01:59:55,193 --> 01:59:56,387
An object lesson.

1828
01:59:56,461 --> 01:59:59,726
- Would you like me to help you, ma'am?
- No, thanks. You go to bed.

1829
01:59:59,798 --> 02:00:01,060
Good night, ma'am.

1830
02:00:01,133 --> 02:00:03,260
Good night, Mrs. Morehead.

1831
02:00:03,902 --> 02:00:06,063
- Good book?
- I think so.

1832
02:00:06,672 --> 02:00:08,731
It seems to be about love.

1833
02:00:09,408 --> 02:00:12,707
- I wish you could find...
- ''Some nice <i>man.''</i>

1834
02:00:13,545 --> 02:00:16,480
Haven't we been
over that enough times, dear?

1835
02:00:16,582 --> 02:00:19,016
I had the only one I ever wanted.

1836
02:00:19,985 --> 02:00:22,453
If it hadn't been for my <i>pride...</i>

1837
02:00:23,689 --> 02:00:27,250
But Stephen is happy, dear.
Why can't you forget him?

1838
02:00:27,326 --> 02:00:28,623
Now, Mother.

1839
02:00:28,894 --> 02:00:31,385
Cheer up.
Living alone has its compensations.

1840
02:00:31,463 --> 02:00:34,796
It's marvelous to be able
to spread out in bed like a swastika.

1841
02:00:34,866 --> 02:00:37,596
- Good night, dear.
- Good night, darling.

1842
02:00:37,669 --> 02:00:40,638
And don't read too long.
It'll hurt your eyes.

1843
02:01:10,836 --> 02:01:13,805
''But if you would seek
only love's pleasure...

1844
02:01:14,773 --> 02:01:19,767
<i>''...then</i> it is better for you to pass out
of love's domain into the outside world...

1845
02:01:21,580 --> 02:01:25,209
''...where you shall laugh,
but not all of your laughter...

1846
02:01:26,451 --> 02:01:28,078
<i>''...and</i> weep...

1847
02:01:28,654 --> 02:01:30,986
<i>''...but</i> not all of your <i>tears.''</i>

1848
02:01:34,960 --> 02:01:36,154
Mother.

1849
02:01:39,831 --> 02:01:41,958
What's the matter, darling?

1850
02:01:43,669 --> 02:01:45,569
May I crawl in with you tonight?

1851
02:01:45,637 --> 02:01:48,834
Yes, but I'm so restless.
I'm apt to keep you awake, honey.

1852
02:01:48,907 --> 02:01:51,375
- I don't mind.
- Come on, jump in then.

1853
02:01:53,612 --> 02:01:55,876
That's the only good thing about divorce.

1854
02:01:55,947 --> 02:01:58,415
You get to sleep with your mother.

1855
02:01:58,717 --> 02:02:01,880
- I taste lipstick.
- I haven't washed yet.

1856
02:02:02,754 --> 02:02:04,312
Good night, darling.

1857
02:02:04,389 --> 02:02:07,187
You know,
you're a very sympathetic mother.

1858
02:02:07,259 --> 02:02:09,557
- Am I?
- Yes.

1859
02:02:09,628 --> 02:02:11,858
So would you scratch my back?

1860
02:02:15,000 --> 02:02:17,798
All right, but go to sleep.

1861
02:02:18,503 --> 02:02:22,371
- I can't go to sleep.
- Yes, you can, if you try. Good night.

1862
02:02:22,941 --> 02:02:25,842
No, I can't. I have such a big problem.

1863
02:02:26,645 --> 02:02:27,839
Have you?

1864
02:02:28,246 --> 02:02:31,738
Which is the most important,
truth or honor?

1865
02:02:31,817 --> 02:02:35,344
They're equally important, darling.
One doesn't exist without the other.

1866
02:02:35,420 --> 02:02:37,980
Yes, it does. It does with Daddy.

1867
02:02:38,390 --> 02:02:40,984
You see, tonight Daddy told me a lie.

1868
02:02:42,127 --> 02:02:44,527
- I don't think he did.
- Yes, he did.

1869
02:02:44,596 --> 02:02:48,930
He did it for an honorable reason,
but he shouldn't lie to me...

1870
02:02:49,134 --> 02:02:50,658
...even to save her skin.

1871
02:02:50,736 --> 02:02:52,465
- To save whose skin?
- Crystal's.

1872
02:02:52,537 --> 02:02:55,938
Walking home tonight,
Daddy said he was going up to Canada...

1873
02:02:56,274 --> 02:02:58,834
...where you and he had your honeymoon.

1874
02:02:58,910 --> 02:03:03,609
So I thought it was about time he stopped
pretending to me that he likes Crystal.

1875
02:03:04,883 --> 02:03:08,375
- But he does like her very much, dear.
- That's what he lets on.

1876
02:03:08,453 --> 02:03:11,115
If he'd only break down
and say he's going up there...

1877
02:03:11,189 --> 02:03:14,317
...because he simply can't bear her
another day.

1878
02:03:14,559 --> 02:03:17,084
- Why, Mary!
- He's so miserable.

1879
02:03:17,496 --> 02:03:22,490
He sits for hours all alone in his study,
with his head buried in his hands...

1880
02:03:22,567 --> 02:03:26,367
...while that silly thing plays solitaire
with the radio on.

1881
02:03:27,572 --> 02:03:29,904
Why haven't you told me
about Daddy before?

1882
02:03:29,975 --> 02:03:33,035
Because you've cried over him
just about enough.

1883
02:03:34,412 --> 02:03:36,937
- Please keep on scratching.
- Sorry.

1884
02:03:37,415 --> 02:03:40,350
I told Daddy tonight
I was going to tell you.

1885
02:03:40,485 --> 02:03:41,918
And what did he say?

1886
02:03:41,987 --> 02:03:45,388
He said not to because
why would you care how he feels.

1887
02:03:55,000 --> 02:03:58,197
- Is Crystal happy, do you think?
- I suppose she is.

1888
02:03:58,904 --> 02:04:02,601
She's got somebody she talks to
lovey-dovey on the phone.

1889
02:04:03,642 --> 02:04:05,906
Don't stop scratching, Mother.

1890
02:04:09,748 --> 02:04:12,546
- Do you know who it is?
- No, I don't know.

1891
02:04:13,652 --> 02:04:18,351
Guess you'd have to ask Auntie Sylvia.
They're together all the time.

1892
02:04:22,294 --> 02:04:25,593
- What are you doing?
- Go to sleep, darling.

1893
02:04:25,664 --> 02:04:27,894
- Are you getting dressed?
- Yes.

1894
02:04:27,966 --> 02:04:31,129
- You forgot you were invited to a party?
- Almost.

1895
02:04:32,337 --> 02:04:35,500
- Are you ill, dear? You rang.
- I never felt better in my life.

1896
02:04:35,574 --> 02:04:36,802
- Did you ring?
- Yes.

1897
02:04:36,875 --> 02:04:39,742
My new evening wrap and a taxi!
Don't stand there! Hurry!

1898
02:04:39,811 --> 02:04:42,006
Mary Haines, what is all this?

1899
02:04:42,747 --> 02:04:45,545
I've had two years to grow claws, Mother.

1900
02:04:45,617 --> 02:04:47,175
Jungle Red!

1901
02:05:02,734 --> 02:05:05,635
Did you see those quaint types
with the Vanderheisens?

1902
02:05:05,704 --> 02:05:08,730
Yes. What filthy-looking outsiders!
Who are they?

1903
02:05:08,807 --> 02:05:10,638
I wouldn't admit it if I knew, pet.

1904
02:05:10,709 --> 02:05:14,110
Really, something ought to be done
to protect New York.

1905
02:05:14,779 --> 02:05:18,078
Are you sure Mrs. Fowler
didn't leave the restaurant before I came?

1906
02:05:18,149 --> 02:05:20,344
- I'm sure.
- You know her by sight, don't you?

1907
02:05:20,418 --> 02:05:24,184
She's famous for the size of her tips.
Not even a thin dime.

1908
02:05:24,389 --> 02:05:27,449
But it's getting late.
Maybe she's decided not to come.

1909
02:05:27,692 --> 02:05:29,523
Yes, maybe. Thank you.

1910
02:05:29,995 --> 02:05:33,294
It's one thing to come out,
but quite another to go under the table.

1911
02:05:33,365 --> 02:05:36,926
Don't think I didn't hear that Princeton boy
call me an old drizzle-puss.

1912
02:05:37,002 --> 02:05:38,629
Try these smelling salts.

1913
02:05:38,703 --> 02:05:41,501
Please come back out.
You've been in here over an hour.

1914
02:05:41,573 --> 02:05:43,564
- Have I?
- Are you waiting for someone?

1915
02:05:43,642 --> 02:05:45,303
No, I have sort of a headache.

1916
02:05:45,377 --> 02:05:47,937
You're not going to get rid of it
in this bad air.

1917
02:05:48,013 --> 02:05:50,072
No, perhaps you're right.

1918
02:05:50,582 --> 02:05:52,982
- Thank you.
- Thank you, ma'am.

1919
02:05:54,786 --> 02:05:57,346
- Stephen is in such a mood.
- lx-nay.

1920
02:05:58,924 --> 02:06:00,789
How do you do?

1921
02:06:02,494 --> 02:06:04,018
Hello, Peggy.

1922
02:06:08,300 --> 02:06:11,667
Stephen is going to give me pearls
for my birthday. Isn't that sweet?

1923
02:06:11,736 --> 02:06:15,331
You have me to thank for those, dear.
I told him you'd love them.

1924
02:06:15,407 --> 02:06:16,840
Thank you, darling.

1925
02:06:17,008 --> 02:06:18,566
I beg your pardon.

1926
02:06:19,144 --> 02:06:21,203
- Come on.
- I have to fix my makeup.

1927
02:06:21,279 --> 02:06:24,009
- Hurry up before they come back.
- Leave me alone.

1928
02:06:24,082 --> 02:06:25,379
Why, Mary!

1929
02:06:25,750 --> 02:06:30,210
So he says, <i>''I</i> got to go home on <i>Sunday.''</i>
So I said, ''Why do you got to? <i>''</i>

1930
02:06:30,288 --> 02:06:33,121
He says, ''They always expect me home
on Easter <i>Sunday.''</i>

1931
02:06:33,191 --> 02:06:35,716
I said, ''What do they expect you to do,
lay an egg? <i>''</i>

1932
02:06:35,794 --> 02:06:37,591
What are you up to?

1933
02:06:39,831 --> 02:06:42,391
Did I tell you I'm going to Dr. Sylvester?

1934
02:06:42,467 --> 02:06:45,766
My dear, he keeps me for hours
and never sends me a bill.

1935
02:06:45,837 --> 02:06:48,362
He tells me the pleasure is all his.

1936
02:06:52,077 --> 02:06:55,376
You've never been
to Dr. Sylvester in your life!

1937
02:06:58,883 --> 02:07:01,113
You still here, Mary?

1938
02:07:02,320 --> 02:07:04,447
I've got stocking trouble.

1939
02:07:05,924 --> 02:07:07,221
What a bore.

1940
02:07:07,292 --> 02:07:09,658
- How have you been feeling?
- Quite well.

1941
02:07:09,728 --> 02:07:12,697
I just heard you say
you'd been to the doctor.

1942
02:07:13,365 --> 02:07:14,457
Jealous?

1943
02:07:14,532 --> 02:07:17,057
Don't be silly.
I'm not interested in Dr. Sylvester.

1944
02:07:17,135 --> 02:07:18,693
Dolly Dupuyster!

1945
02:07:18,770 --> 02:07:23,070
Hello, girls. My, but you look lovely.
Got any dirt for the column?

1946
02:07:23,141 --> 02:07:24,904
Not a thing, sweet.

1947
02:07:24,976 --> 02:07:27,672
No? Get me my coat, Sadie.
I might as well shove off.

1948
02:07:27,746 --> 02:07:30,647
- I've never seen such a clean joint.
- Don't be coy.

1949
02:07:30,715 --> 02:07:34,412
It's all over town what a fool you're making
of yourself over Dr. Sylvester.

1950
02:07:34,486 --> 02:07:37,250
Just a minute!
I'd thank you to explain that last crack.

1951
02:07:37,322 --> 02:07:38,448
Girls, Dolly Dupuyster!

1952
02:07:38,523 --> 02:07:41,219
You're paying him $100 an hour
just to hold your hand.

1953
02:07:41,292 --> 02:07:43,453
- Did he tell you that?
- Of course not.

1954
02:07:43,528 --> 02:07:45,826
He never discusses his patients.

1955
02:07:45,897 --> 02:07:48,092
- You aren't feeling well.
- Yes, I am.

1956
02:07:48,166 --> 02:07:49,394
I'm going to get Nancy.

1957
02:07:49,467 --> 02:07:52,925
I haven't seen you for two years.
Where do you get your information?

1958
02:07:53,004 --> 02:07:54,301
Where do you suppose?

1959
02:07:54,372 --> 02:07:58,138
- Where?
- From Crystal.

1960
02:08:00,945 --> 02:08:02,310
Why, <i>you...</i>

1961
02:08:06,785 --> 02:08:11,085
Of course. By way of every saleswoman
and manicurist in New York.

1962
02:08:14,726 --> 02:08:17,889
She's now telling that
he had to grow a Vandyke beard...

1963
02:08:17,962 --> 02:08:20,328
...so you can't see him laughing at you.

1964
02:08:20,398 --> 02:08:23,299
The rotten <i>little...</i> I'll slit her throat!

1965
02:08:23,435 --> 02:08:27,633
You're the only friend she's got.
Who else can she gossip about?

1966
02:08:27,705 --> 02:08:30,902
She's got Buck Winston!
Why can't she tell about him?

1967
02:08:30,975 --> 02:08:32,465
Buck Winston!

1968
02:08:33,845 --> 02:08:36,336
Why, Mary Haines!
You fished that out of me!

1969
02:08:36,414 --> 02:08:39,178
- Good night, girls.
- Dolly, stick around!

1970
02:08:39,751 --> 02:08:41,844
- Something's going to pop.
- Good and dirty?

1971
02:08:41,920 --> 02:08:45,481
Go and ask Buck Winston what famous
society matron is crazy about him.

1972
02:08:45,557 --> 02:08:47,752
Oh, boy, dirt! Out of my way!

1973
02:08:47,892 --> 02:08:51,760
Why, you! I'll shut Buck Winston's trap
if it's the last act of my life.

1974
02:08:51,830 --> 02:08:55,163
No, you won't. You're going to stay here.
Stop her, girls!

1975
02:08:55,233 --> 02:08:58,498
- Where were you going, my pretty maid?
- Peggy, lock the door.

1976
02:08:58,570 --> 02:09:01,539
- Any place we can lock her up?
- In the closet.

1977
02:09:01,806 --> 02:09:04,172
- Mary dear, I'll stay here.
- You bet you will.

1978
02:09:04,242 --> 02:09:06,506
You'd better think of your job,
my good woman.

1979
02:09:06,578 --> 02:09:08,739
I'm thinking of the tips you never gave me.

1980
02:09:08,813 --> 02:09:11,805
- This isn't like you.
- I haven't even started yet.

1981
02:09:11,883 --> 02:09:15,080
- Whatever you're up to, I'm for it.
- Go and unlock the door.

1982
02:09:16,988 --> 02:09:19,786
- Who locked that door?
- I'm sorry, ma'am. It got stuck.

1983
02:09:20,925 --> 02:09:22,984
- Come out, quick! All heck's broken loose!
- Of course it has.

1984
02:09:23,228 --> 02:09:25,924
Buck Winston just spilled
the most terrific load of dirt.

1985
02:09:25,997 --> 02:09:28,158
Stephen had to knock him cold
to shut his trap.

1986
02:09:28,233 --> 02:09:32,329
- And the joint's full of newspaper cameras.
- I knew Dolly could do it!

1987
02:09:32,403 --> 02:09:34,598
Go out there and reconnoiter.

1988
02:09:37,308 --> 02:09:39,674
How could Buck have done that to me?

1989
02:09:39,744 --> 02:09:43,373
The Dr. Jekyll and The Mr. Hyde!
Which was which?

1990
02:09:43,448 --> 02:09:45,040
Now, Flora, calm down.

1991
02:09:45,116 --> 02:09:50,110
Of all five husbands,
Buck is the first one to insult me in public.

1992
02:09:52,457 --> 02:09:53,856
Poor Flora.

1993
02:09:54,559 --> 02:09:55,617
What did he do?

1994
02:09:55,693 --> 02:09:58,628
Do? He confessed an undying love
for little Crystal.

1995
02:09:58,696 --> 02:10:00,425
To Dolly Dupuyster, no less.

1996
02:10:00,732 --> 02:10:04,031
So that everybody in the place
could hear him.

1997
02:10:04,502 --> 02:10:06,367
Oh, the publicity!

1998
02:10:06,604 --> 02:10:09,129
<i>La publicité!</i>

1999
02:10:09,574 --> 02:10:13,772
- He even spilled dates and addresses.
- Don't worry, I jotted them all down.

2000
02:10:13,845 --> 02:10:16,871
He said he'd be a cock-eyed coyote...

2001
02:10:16,948 --> 02:10:21,408
...before he'd herd an old beef like me
back to the Coast.

2002
02:10:23,521 --> 02:10:27,480
Get me a bromide. And put some gin in it.

2003
02:10:30,762 --> 02:10:33,458
Hey, you! Is Mrs. Fowler in here?

2004
02:10:33,865 --> 02:10:35,298
And how!

2005
02:10:35,900 --> 02:10:37,026
Open it up, Sadie.

2006
02:10:39,604 --> 02:10:43,335
I'll sue, that's what I'll do.
I'll sue everybody in this place.

2007
02:10:44,509 --> 02:10:47,444
It's kidnapping, that's what it is.
It's kidnapping!

2008
02:10:47,712 --> 02:10:49,737
You've been shooting off
your mouth, you rat!

2009
02:10:49,814 --> 02:10:52,112
I didn't say a word. Mary got it out of me!

2010
02:10:52,517 --> 02:10:54,178
It wasn't hard to do.

2011
02:10:54,419 --> 02:10:58,048
Why, you rotten <i>little...</i>
Just wait till I start talking about you.

2012
02:10:58,122 --> 02:10:59,282
You can't say a thing!

2013
02:10:59,357 --> 02:11:02,986
And besides, I knew you'd lose
Stephen Haines, you shopgirl.

2014
02:11:04,128 --> 02:11:06,756
You're trying to break up my marriage,
you cats!

2015
02:11:06,831 --> 02:11:08,355
But get this straight.

2016
02:11:08,433 --> 02:11:11,732
You can't stampede me by gossip
or the ravings of Buck Winston.

2017
02:11:11,803 --> 02:11:14,431
You've got to have evidence.
And Stephen is a gentleman.

2018
02:11:14,505 --> 02:11:16,905
He doesn't need it outside New York.

2019
02:11:16,975 --> 02:11:19,205
He's fed up with you.
In your heart, you know it.

2020
02:11:19,277 --> 02:11:22,007
Take my advice.
Put your mind on your alimony.

2021
02:11:22,080 --> 02:11:25,811
Alimony? With what Stephen has on you,
he won't have to give you a dime.

2022
02:11:25,883 --> 02:11:27,316
Is that so?

2023
02:11:27,819 --> 02:11:30,811
What if I don't need alimony?
How would you like that?

2024
02:11:30,888 --> 02:11:33,288
- You don't?
- What are you going to use instead?

2025
02:11:33,358 --> 02:11:34,586
Buck Winston.

2026
02:11:35,593 --> 02:11:37,060
The ingrate!

2027
02:11:37,295 --> 02:11:40,287
Your cowboy and I get along great,
Countess. Just great.

2028
02:11:40,365 --> 02:11:44,301
And the dough he earns on the radio
is more than Stephen will ever dig up.

2029
02:11:44,369 --> 02:11:46,735
Buck and I are tickled to death
to be rid of you.

2030
02:11:46,804 --> 02:11:48,203
The ingrate!

2031
02:11:48,273 --> 02:11:50,798
Cheer up. This is a new lesson in <i>amour.</i>

2032
02:11:50,875 --> 02:11:55,141
That's right. See to it that your
next husband isn't financially independent.

2033
02:11:55,213 --> 02:11:56,578
Buck isn't independent.

2034
02:11:56,648 --> 02:11:58,843
Hasn't he a contract with Dandy Gelatine?

2035
02:11:58,916 --> 02:12:02,443
No, darling. I am Dandy Gelatine.

2036
02:12:03,588 --> 02:12:07,046
Nobody would give Buck a job
on the radio, the old meanies...

2037
02:12:07,392 --> 02:12:10,054
...so I had to buy out Dandy Gelatine.

2038
02:12:15,233 --> 02:12:19,135
You can buy it now, dear,
and give Buck away with every package.

2039
02:12:21,139 --> 02:12:25,235
Girls, looks like it's back
to the perfume counter for me.

2040
02:12:26,544 --> 02:12:29,536
And by the way,
there's a name for you ladies...

2041
02:12:29,614 --> 02:12:33,072
...but it isn't used in high society,
outside of a kennel.

2042
02:12:33,284 --> 02:12:34,273
So long, ladies.

2043
02:12:34,352 --> 02:12:37,810
Mary, Stephen is outside.
He's waiting for you.

2044
02:12:37,889 --> 02:12:41,154
He wants to know if you'll see him.
Will you, please?

2045
02:12:41,426 --> 02:12:44,156
Will I? You bet I will!

2046
02:12:45,063 --> 02:12:48,897
- Mary Haines, haven't you any pride?
- No pride at all.

2047
02:12:49,400 --> 02:12:52,062
That's a luxury women in love can't afford.
