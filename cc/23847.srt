00:01:08,833 --> 00:01:11,324
<i>I was the third brother of five</i>

2
00:01:11,836 --> 00:01:15,002
<i>Doing whatever I had to do to survive</i>

3
00:01:16,298 --> 00:01:19,134
<i>I'm not saying what I did was all right</i>

4
00:01:19,219 --> 00:01:21,342
<i>Trying to break out of the ghetto</i>

5
00:01:21,429 --> 00:01:23,469
<i>Was a day-to-day fight</i>

6
00:01:23,556 --> 00:01:26,890
<i>Been down so long,
getting up didn't cross my mind</i>

7
00:01:26,976 --> 00:01:30,761
<i>But I knew there was a better way of life
that I was just trying to find</i>

8
00:01:30,856 --> 00:01:34,390
<i>You don't know what you'll do
until you're put under pressure</i>

9
00:01:34,484 --> 00:01:37,485
<i>Across 110th Street is a hell of a tester</i>

10
00:01:38,321 --> 00:01:41,238
<i>Across 110th Street</i>

11
00:01:41,324 --> 00:01:45,536
<i>Pimps trying to catch a woman that's weak</i>

12
00:01:45,621 --> 00:01:48,028
<i>Across 110th Street</i>

13
00:01:48,123 --> 00:01:52,868
<i>The pushers won't let the junkie go free</i>

14
00:01:52,961 --> 00:01:55,749
<i>Across 110th Street</i>

15
00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:00,086
<i>A woman trying to catch a trick on the street</i>

16
00:02:00,177 --> 00:02:03,343
<i>Across 110th Street</i>

17
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:10,845
<i>You can find it all, yeah</i>

18
00:02:10,938 --> 00:02:13,725
<i>Find it all in the street</i>

19
00:02:13,816 --> 00:02:17,564
<i>Oh, yeah, yeah</i>

20
00:02:17,653 --> 00:02:21,521
<i>Brother, there's a better way out</i>

21
00:02:21,616 --> 00:02:23,655
<i>Snorting that coke, shooting that dope, man</i>

22
00:02:23,743 --> 00:02:25,071
<i>You're copping out</i>

23
00:02:25,161 --> 00:02:29,408
<i>Take my advice, it's either live or die</i>

24
00:02:29,498 --> 00:02:32,702
<i>You've gotta be strong if you wanna survive</i>

25
00:02:32,794 --> 00:02:36,494
<i>The family on the other side of town</i>

26
00:02:36,589 --> 00:02:39,080
<i>Would catch hell without a ghetto around</i>

27
00:02:39,926 --> 00:02:43,876
<i>In every city you find the same thing going down</i>

28
00:02:43,972 --> 00:02:47,590
<i>Harlem is the capital of every ghetto town</i>

29
00:02:48,602 --> 00:02:49,977
<i>Look around you</i>

30
00:02:50,061 --> 00:02:51,686
<i>Oh, look around you</i>

31
00:02:51,771 --> 00:02:53,598
<i>Look around you</i>

32
00:02:53,690 --> 00:02:56,146
<i>Ooh, look around you, yeah</i>

33
00:02:56,235 --> 00:02:59,319
<i>Ooh, yeah</i>

34
00:03:47,871 --> 00:03:49,910
That's them.

35
00:03:55,086 --> 00:03:57,838
- We had an OK week.
- Why wouldn't we?

36
00:04:10,853 --> 00:04:12,892
Get Monday's stuff together.

37
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:17,265
Now, what have we got here?

38
00:04:21,781 --> 00:04:24,651
- All right, gentlemen, let's go.
- All right.

39
00:04:25,617 --> 00:04:29,449
575.
575.

40
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:33,532
590.
575.

41
00:04:38,422 --> 00:04:42,835
First one's 20 from St Nicholas, second 108.

42
00:04:45,554 --> 00:04:47,547
625.

43
00:04:48,099 --> 00:04:50,672
- 625, yeah?
- 625.

44
00:04:50,768 --> 00:04:52,844
783.

45
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:01,230
- 590.
- 590, check.

46
00:05:02,989 --> 00:05:04,946
575, check.

47
00:05:11,498 --> 00:05:13,656
- OK.
- 623.

48
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:16,206
623.

49
00:05:17,253 --> 00:05:18,795
Under the table.

50
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:21,169
Is anybody in there driving a '68 Caddy?

51
00:05:21,841 --> 00:05:24,926
- It's two cops.
- Give the assholes a couple of dollars.

52
00:05:26,596 --> 00:05:28,719
Give them 20 dollars.

53
00:05:28,807 --> 00:05:32,555
- Everybody back against the window.
- What's going on?

54
00:05:32,644 --> 00:05:35,729
Hey, I know him. That's Jim Harris.

55
00:05:35,814 --> 00:05:37,724
- Where's your gun?
- I don't have any.

56
00:05:37,816 --> 00:05:41,814
- What's up, man?
- What the hell does it look like?

57
00:05:41,904 --> 00:05:45,604
- Up with those hands.
- Thought you were still in the joint.

58
00:05:45,699 --> 00:05:49,318
- Harris, you can't jive in here and take money.
- Shut it.

59
00:05:51,747 --> 00:05:54,072
Come on, baby.

60
00:06:34,624 --> 00:06:36,783
No! For God's sake!

61
00:07:08,367 --> 00:07:10,406
Come on.

62
00:07:19,462 --> 00:07:21,668
Not so goddamn fast.

63
00:07:25,384 --> 00:07:27,627
OK, let's go. Let's go.

64
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:31,671
Come on.

65
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,689
- Hey, Joe, you all right?
- I'm all right.

66
00:07:42,777 --> 00:07:45,233
Come on, you can't crap out on me now.

67
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,039
What the hell's going on?

68
00:08:07,386 --> 00:08:10,090
Drive, man. Drive.

69
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:12,932
What happened up there? Shit, the truck.

70
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,290
What's the matter, Henry? Can't you drive?

71
00:08:40,378 --> 00:08:43,130
- It's stalled!
- Then get it going!

72
00:08:43,214 --> 00:08:46,962
- Let's get out of here.
- Hey, Jim, cop! Cop!

73
00:08:48,761 --> 00:08:51,430
Drive. Drive!

74
00:09:17,958 --> 00:09:21,956
Here, Tony, give him a kiss, give him a kiss.

75
00:09:22,045 --> 00:09:25,995
That's it. Remember Grandpa?
He gave you the bicycle last Christmas.

76
00:09:32,473 --> 00:09:35,011
- You wanna hold him, Grandpa?
- What?

77
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:37,805
- You remember my Uncle Charlie?
- Who?

78
00:09:37,895 --> 00:09:40,267
Uncle Charlie! It's good to see you.

79
00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:06,920
- What are you going outside for?
- Nick! Take the kid.

80
00:10:07,926 --> 00:10:09,753
Take the kid!

81
00:10:09,844 --> 00:10:13,178
- Sure. Anything else?
- No, that's all right.

82
00:10:13,264 --> 00:10:15,304
- You sure?
- That's all right.

83
00:10:16,726 --> 00:10:19,396
Hey, Theresa, take the kids.

84
00:10:19,479 --> 00:10:22,765
God, they're always running all over the hall.

85
00:10:42,378 --> 00:10:44,833
I love it.
You like this?

86
00:10:46,674 --> 00:10:53,423
Compare mio, da quanto tempo!
Come e bello.

87
00:10:54,891 --> 00:10:58,141
- Nicky, get Mamma some champagne.
- Un pochettino, huh?

88
00:10:58,227 --> 00:11:00,932
You get it for her, Theresa, I'm busy. You get it.

89
00:11:03,315 --> 00:11:06,186
- Hello, Nick.
- How are you? Good to see you.

90
00:11:06,276 --> 00:11:09,148
- Hi.
- Excuse me. Excuse me.

91
00:11:15,077 --> 00:11:18,660
- What is it?
- Nick, look.

92
00:11:19,291 --> 00:11:21,330
What do you see?

93
00:11:23,294 --> 00:11:25,334
Central Park.

94
00:11:25,421 --> 00:11:27,544
Central Park, si.

95
00:11:27,632 --> 00:11:29,755
But there's also no-man's-land

96
00:11:29,842 --> 00:11:32,927
that separates us from the black in Harlem.

97
00:11:33,013 --> 00:11:36,512
- Yeah.
- Nick.

98
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:39,221
Today they took our bank in Harlem

99
00:11:39,310 --> 00:11:41,599
for over 300,000 dollar.

100
00:11:41,688 --> 00:11:43,728
What?

101
00:11:44,525 --> 00:11:47,194
They killed two of the family,

102
00:11:47,277 --> 00:11:49,946
two cops, and two of their own.

103
00:11:50,030 --> 00:11:54,905
Nick, it ain't for the money, it ain't for the men,

104
00:11:54,993 --> 00:11:58,528
but we have to teach them a lesson

105
00:11:58,622 --> 00:12:00,662
or we'll lose Harlem.

106
00:12:00,749 --> 00:12:01,780
Yes.

107
00:12:01,875 --> 00:12:03,998
If we lose Harlem,

108
00:12:04,086 --> 00:12:06,873
we lose a lot more than the money.

109
00:12:06,963 --> 00:12:10,464
We lose il prestigio, I'onore.

110
00:12:11,302 --> 00:12:14,967
Nick, chi controlla la giocata

111
00:12:15,931 --> 00:12:19,596
controlla la citta e forse tutto lo Stato.

112
00:12:19,685 --> 00:12:22,687
'They're trying to push us out of Harlem.

113
00:12:22,772 --> 00:12:25,014
'We worked too hard to get it.

114
00:12:25,108 --> 00:12:27,598
'This may be your last chance.

115
00:12:27,693 --> 00:12:30,231
'It may be mine to do something for you.

116
00:12:30,321 --> 00:12:34,948
'Take care of yourself, Nick.
They're rough, those niggers.

117
00:12:35,035 --> 00:12:37,110
'All right?

118
00:12:37,203 --> 00:12:39,741
'Now, Nick, say the truth.

119
00:12:40,373 --> 00:12:43,327
- 'Can you handle it? '
- Sure, I can handle it.

120
00:12:43,918 --> 00:12:46,125
- What?
- Yeah, sure you can.

121
00:13:28,255 --> 00:13:31,256
Captain Mattelli, it's been a bitch. World War Two.

122
00:13:31,342 --> 00:13:34,758
So I heard. It's a real beaut, huh?
Where's Reilly?

123
00:13:34,846 --> 00:13:37,467
Last time I saw him he was on the ambulance.

124
00:13:38,641 --> 00:13:42,473
Reilly. Why the hell wasn't I called before?

125
00:13:42,561 --> 00:13:45,562
Frank, you were off duty,
we got to you as soon as we could.

126
00:13:45,648 --> 00:13:48,056
- OK, brief me. Brief me.
- Seven dead.

127
00:13:48,151 --> 00:13:50,642
Seven? I heard six.

128
00:13:50,737 --> 00:13:54,983
Patrolman Hanratty on the way to the hospital,
doesn't stand a chance.

129
00:13:55,074 --> 00:13:58,158
- Anything else?
- Right now, just bodies.

130
00:13:58,244 --> 00:14:00,617
Three white, four black, all dead.

131
00:14:01,665 --> 00:14:03,408
Where were the boys hit?

132
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:09,372
Hanratty about 30 yards down,
about where that prowl car is.

133
00:14:09,464 --> 00:14:13,248
Patrolman Adams was coming around that corner.

134
00:14:13,343 --> 00:14:15,881
- Where did it happen? Upstairs?
- Yeah.

135
00:14:24,188 --> 00:14:27,189
- How's this car involved?
- Checking the registration.

136
00:14:27,274 --> 00:14:29,314
It must have brought some of them here.

137
00:14:29,401 --> 00:14:31,144
- Hi, Dick.
- Captain.

138
00:14:31,236 --> 00:14:33,988
- New York car?
- Yeah, it's local.

139
00:14:37,451 --> 00:14:41,531
Where's the brass?
Chief of detectives is upstairs.

140
00:14:41,622 --> 00:14:44,742
Mayor's busy upstate,
he's running for governor.

141
00:14:44,833 --> 00:14:47,787
Commissioner's telling a convention
in San Francisco

142
00:14:47,879 --> 00:14:50,630
how beautifully we do things in New York.

143
00:14:50,715 --> 00:14:52,957
That's fine, that's great.

144
00:14:54,635 --> 00:14:57,387
- Anything on the canvass?
- Not a damn thing.

145
00:14:57,471 --> 00:15:00,722
Nobody saw, nobody heard, huh?
No.

146
00:15:00,809 --> 00:15:03,050
- It figures.
- Yeah.

147
00:15:06,606 --> 00:15:11,232
You didn't hear anything?
No. It was just terrible.

148
00:15:18,159 --> 00:15:20,650
The dude they took out before was cut in two.

149
00:15:58,075 --> 00:16:02,073
- Machine gun.
- They've found them halfway down the block.

150
00:16:02,163 --> 00:16:04,405
Nine millimeter. Lots of them.

151
00:16:19,597 --> 00:16:22,088
Jimmy, take a few frontal shots.

152
00:16:22,975 --> 00:16:25,893
- Hello, Frank.
- Hiya, Charlie.

153
00:16:25,978 --> 00:16:29,644
- Got yourself a handful now.
- Things don't add up.

154
00:16:29,733 --> 00:16:33,896
Two whites, three blacks. How do you figure it?

155
00:16:33,987 --> 00:16:37,355
What else brings whites to Harlem
but business?

156
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:56,958
Who are you?

157
00:16:57,719 --> 00:17:00,590
- You must be Captain Mattelli.
- That's right.

158
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:04,596
I'm Lieutenant William Aylesworth Pope.
I'm in charge here.

159
00:17:07,563 --> 00:17:09,769
Excuse me.

160
00:17:11,316 --> 00:17:16,691
- What did you say?
- I said I'm Lieutenant Pope. I'm in charge here.

161
00:17:19,867 --> 00:17:21,990
- Meaning what?
- Meaning, Captain,

162
00:17:22,078 --> 00:17:26,371
- I'm Lieutenant Pope, I'm in charge here.
- Frank.

163
00:17:27,667 --> 00:17:31,451
- Hey, Jack.
- Can I talk to you a minute?

164
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:43,301
- We got the big brass, huh?
- Come on in a minute, I wanna talk to you.

165
00:17:43,391 --> 00:17:48,468
- Yeah?
- Er, shut the door.

166
00:17:55,696 --> 00:17:58,732
- Yeah, Jack?
- Frank, this one's gonna be a bitch.

167
00:17:58,823 --> 00:18:01,279
Downtown's afraid it's gonna hit the fan.

168
00:18:01,368 --> 00:18:03,823
Did you bring me in here to make a speech?

169
00:18:03,912 --> 00:18:07,862
- No I didn't. You're not gonna like it.
- Stop dancing around. Tell me.

170
00:18:07,958 --> 00:18:12,703
Politicians feel that this other guy here
should carry the ball.

171
00:18:12,796 --> 00:18:16,544
- Who?
- Him. The black guy.

172
00:18:17,718 --> 00:18:21,502
- Why, because he's black?
- Because he's black, yeah.

173
00:18:21,597 --> 00:18:25,760
Jack, here in Harlem he's gonna get
the same flak I do. He's still a cop.

174
00:18:25,851 --> 00:18:27,642
What the hell do you care?

175
00:18:27,728 --> 00:18:33,067
Can he stop a race riot because he's black?
Last year I stopped it myself, Jack.

176
00:18:33,150 --> 00:18:36,768
- It's just politics, Frank.
- Screw politics.

177
00:18:36,862 --> 00:18:39,234
Look, I'm not gonna listen to any of this.

178
00:18:39,323 --> 00:18:43,487
You've got to get it through your head, Frank.
It's his baby.

179
00:18:43,578 --> 00:18:47,658
- Get that through your head.
- You force this on me and I'll resign.

180
00:18:53,922 --> 00:18:57,172
I'll give it to you straight. They'd like that.

181
00:18:58,093 --> 00:19:00,381
They're pushing out everybody over 50.

182
00:19:00,470 --> 00:19:04,763
- How old are you?
- You know damn well I'm 55 just like you.

183
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:09,395
What do we do because we're 55? Eat shit?

184
00:19:14,776 --> 00:19:16,899
I don't know, Frank.

185
00:19:16,986 --> 00:19:19,229
I made peace with my reality.

186
00:19:20,449 --> 00:19:23,569
You're gonna have to make it with yours.

187
00:19:43,431 --> 00:19:45,388
What's his name?

188
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:53,849
Son of a bitch, we're in for trouble -
it's the old man's son-in-law.

189
00:19:56,152 --> 00:19:59,188
Hey, Nick. What do you say, Nick?

190
00:20:00,698 --> 00:20:02,856
Long time no see.

191
00:20:07,581 --> 00:20:09,869
Come on. I wanna talk to you.

192
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:29,638
You didn't have any guard downstairs?

193
00:20:29,727 --> 00:20:31,935
You didn't have a lookout, huh?

194
00:20:33,482 --> 00:20:36,399
15 years, we never been hit.

195
00:20:36,485 --> 00:20:38,608
We change apartments.

196
00:20:38,695 --> 00:20:42,527
We never used that one before,
we thought we were OK.

197
00:20:42,616 --> 00:20:44,574
You thought?

198
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:49,238
Your ass must've been thinking
because now we're out $300,000.

199
00:20:49,331 --> 00:20:52,332
Do you hear me good? We're out $300,000.

200
00:20:52,417 --> 00:20:54,624
Now what do we do?

201
00:20:54,711 --> 00:20:59,173
I don't blame the old man for being mad
but anybody can get ripped off.

202
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:01,630
Not when you work for us.

203
00:21:01,719 --> 00:21:05,668
Harlem is ours. We found it, we made it,
and we're gonna keep it.

204
00:21:05,764 --> 00:21:10,094
This shit ain't ever gonna happen again.
You hear me? Ever.

205
00:21:13,689 --> 00:21:15,896
Now, who did it?

206
00:21:17,985 --> 00:21:21,402
Three black guys. Two dressed as policemen.

207
00:21:22,449 --> 00:21:27,075
I got a reward out for information. A grand.

208
00:21:27,161 --> 00:21:30,744
- Shevvy here's in charge.
- A grand?

209
00:21:30,832 --> 00:21:33,999
What... What are you trying to do? You trying?

210
00:21:34,086 --> 00:21:37,252
You telling me you really want
to find these guys?

211
00:21:37,339 --> 00:21:39,912
What are you talking about?

212
00:21:41,217 --> 00:21:43,922
Five. Five grand.

213
00:21:47,683 --> 00:21:49,806
Five grand.

214
00:21:50,477 --> 00:21:54,557
That's good. Now find them.
But don't touch, they're mine.

215
00:21:54,648 --> 00:21:56,687
I'm gonna teach these guys a lesson.

216
00:21:56,775 --> 00:21:58,934
Goddamn it, D'Salvio.

217
00:21:59,778 --> 00:22:04,274
I've been in charge here 15 years
and nobody tells me how to run my business.

218
00:22:04,366 --> 00:22:09,609
Hey, hey! Your business is running our business.
Do you understand that?

219
00:22:09,705 --> 00:22:12,742
You may be a big shot around here up in Harlem

220
00:22:12,833 --> 00:22:16,249
but below 110th Street
you're nothing but a hired nigger.

221
00:22:17,463 --> 00:22:19,835
That's all.

222
00:22:26,514 --> 00:22:31,341
It's not smart for three dagos
to run around killing brothers up here.

223
00:22:35,482 --> 00:22:37,605
Fuck you and your brothers.

224
00:22:51,373 --> 00:22:54,576
- Hey, D'Salvio!
- Yeah?

225
00:22:54,667 --> 00:22:59,460
You ain't never gonna make it. You know that?
What are you, 45 years old?

226
00:22:59,548 --> 00:23:03,296
You were a punk errand boy
when you married the boss's daughter

227
00:23:03,385 --> 00:23:06,255
and you're still a punk errand boy.

228
00:23:08,223 --> 00:23:10,262
- You motherfucker.
- No, Nick!

229
00:23:10,350 --> 00:23:13,102
- Nick, no.
- All right, all right, all right.

230
00:23:46,512 --> 00:23:50,973
I would've liked to seen Doc's face
when he heard his bank was knocked over.

231
00:23:57,565 --> 00:24:02,524
Hey, Shevvy. Welcome to the 7/11.
What's your pleasure?

232
00:24:02,612 --> 00:24:04,901
You got a chick here named Gloria Roberts?

233
00:24:04,990 --> 00:24:08,608
Yeah, she shills here. Down there.

234
00:24:28,430 --> 00:24:30,672
- You know who I am?
- Yeah.

235
00:24:30,766 --> 00:24:33,304
You work for Poppa Bear.
I used to see you around.

236
00:24:33,393 --> 00:24:36,679
You're in a position to see a whole lot of things.

237
00:24:37,439 --> 00:24:40,275
A hundred bucks for anything interesting.

238
00:24:41,610 --> 00:24:43,936
There's the number.

239
00:24:47,324 --> 00:24:49,482
Hey, Glo.

240
00:24:49,576 --> 00:24:53,278
You losing all your baby fat, you looking good.

241
00:24:53,372 --> 00:24:58,081
It's the big hit today. That's it. The big hit.

242
00:24:59,420 --> 00:25:02,505
You looking real good.

243
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:07,337
Next time we give a party, you gonna be there.

244
00:25:09,013 --> 00:25:11,053
Yeah.

245
00:25:24,362 --> 00:25:27,399
You got a gangster, what you need's a pimp.

246
00:25:28,408 --> 00:25:30,567
'Late this afternoon...

247
00:25:30,661 --> 00:25:34,444
'... broke into a Harlem apartment
and gunned down five occupants. '

248
00:25:34,539 --> 00:25:38,489
Goddamn it, Joe.
You couldn't come by two minutes early?

249
00:25:38,585 --> 00:25:40,128
I doubt that.

250
00:25:40,212 --> 00:25:43,462
'... Timothy Hanratty,
cut down both with machine-gun fire.

251
00:25:43,549 --> 00:25:46,419
'Officer Adams died instantly
from multiple wounds.

252
00:25:46,510 --> 00:25:49,713
'Officer Hanratty passed away
on the operating table... '

253
00:25:49,805 --> 00:25:54,633
How 'bout that? Couple of idiots killed
two more cops and one of them's a brother.

254
00:25:54,727 --> 00:25:56,969
Goddamn.

255
00:25:57,062 --> 00:26:01,309
'It is assumed that Mattelli
will handle the investigation. '

256
00:26:04,279 --> 00:26:07,445
If you don't want my love

257
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:12,950
If you don't need my love

258
00:26:13,954 --> 00:26:16,197
Baby, give...

259
00:26:16,291 --> 00:26:18,330
Mm!

260
00:26:18,418 --> 00:26:20,576
Hey.

261
00:26:20,670 --> 00:26:22,995
Oh, I'd like to have it now

262
00:26:26,467 --> 00:26:29,753
If you don't need my love...

263
00:26:31,514 --> 00:26:34,930
Mm! Shazam! Goddamn.

264
00:26:35,018 --> 00:26:37,509
All you gotta do is

265
00:26:37,604 --> 00:26:40,938
Give it back

266
00:26:42,484 --> 00:26:45,105
I believe some lonely heart could use it

267
00:26:50,909 --> 00:26:53,365
Oh, don't let temptation

268
00:26:56,331 --> 00:26:58,538
Don't let it get the best of you

269
00:27:02,212 --> 00:27:04,454
See you can't have your cake, baby

270
00:27:12,890 --> 00:27:17,517
Hey. I've got a problem.

271
00:27:19,730 --> 00:27:23,479
Damn. You got a problem? How does he feel?

272
00:27:23,567 --> 00:27:26,936
He didn't have them on at the time.
Can you fix them?

273
00:27:27,821 --> 00:27:31,191
Yeah. Hold on a minute.

274
00:27:31,284 --> 00:27:32,482
Hyme's Cleaners.

275
00:27:32,577 --> 00:27:36,906
Joe. Hey, this is me. Is that you?

276
00:27:38,791 --> 00:27:43,039
Hold the phone, will you?
Hey, look, the lady who fixes these is out.

277
00:27:43,130 --> 00:27:48,087
Why don't you bring them back in the morning
and pick them up at night, OK?

278
00:27:53,431 --> 00:27:59,018
- What's happening, man?
- H-H-Hey, man, I just had to say,

279
00:27:59,104 --> 00:28:02,058
we did it, man, we did it.

280
00:28:06,904 --> 00:28:10,438
- Hey, look, you smoking?
- ' Course not. '

281
00:28:10,532 --> 00:28:13,616
Look, we are on fire.

282
00:28:21,627 --> 00:28:23,666
Ooh.

283
00:28:31,471 --> 00:28:34,424
Mm.

284
00:28:56,705 --> 00:28:59,955
- Yeah?
- Henry J is getting highed-up, man.

285
00:29:00,041 --> 00:29:03,457
- Who's it for?
- Son of a bitch.

286
00:29:03,544 --> 00:29:05,620
'What are we gonna do? '

287
00:29:05,713 --> 00:29:08,122
Nothing. Stay loose.

288
00:29:08,967 --> 00:29:14,507
Hey Harris, the goddamn toilet's flushing
into the sink again. Can't you fix it right?

289
00:29:15,140 --> 00:29:17,263
I did what I can without a new valve.

290
00:29:17,350 --> 00:29:19,639
What we gonna do tonight?

291
00:29:20,896 --> 00:29:23,517
Why don't you call the owner in Mexico?

292
00:29:23,607 --> 00:29:26,359
He's usually there this time of the year.

293
00:29:41,792 --> 00:29:43,665
You're lucky, I think it's water.

294
00:29:43,752 --> 00:29:47,003
There's a law against withholding information.

295
00:29:47,089 --> 00:29:49,841
But I tell you, we had the radio on.

296
00:29:51,302 --> 00:29:56,260
You live directly across the street
and over a hundred rounds were fired.

297
00:29:56,348 --> 00:30:00,347
- They play the radio loud.
- Jesus Christ.

298
00:30:00,436 --> 00:30:03,188
Sorry, Officer, we can't be of more help.

299
00:30:04,815 --> 00:30:06,938
We didn't hear or see anything.

300
00:30:09,236 --> 00:30:10,897
Cool it, Jessup.

301
00:30:10,989 --> 00:30:15,651
That's a hundred-dollar bill, brother,
and it be yours if you want it.

302
00:30:18,663 --> 00:30:21,580
Honest man work hard for a hundred dollars.

303
00:30:21,666 --> 00:30:24,952
I'm a brother asking for help and willing to pay.

304
00:30:26,087 --> 00:30:28,874
Go on, take it, Jessup, and let me in,

305
00:30:28,965 --> 00:30:31,290
or you’d better never go out again.

306
00:30:33,803 --> 00:30:35,843
I'm opening.

307
00:30:38,850 --> 00:30:43,014
You know, you done real good
not to say anything to the man.

308
00:30:50,362 --> 00:30:54,490
What the hell you expect me to say?
I don't know a damn thing.

309
00:30:54,575 --> 00:30:58,988
- I don't know nothing, man.
- You mean you didn't hear a goddamn noise?

310
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:03,029
Most men don't rap much
when I'm copping their joint. Want to try me?

311
00:31:03,125 --> 00:31:06,043
Hey, what kind of talk is that? Reilly!

312
00:31:06,128 --> 00:31:08,334
I don't know nothing.

313
00:31:09,381 --> 00:31:12,751
- What the hell's going on?
- He's hauling in a lot of garbage.

314
00:31:12,844 --> 00:31:17,387
Just came in for you.
Male Caucasian, armed robbery.

315
00:31:18,891 --> 00:31:22,758
- Five Asians, huh?
- Listen, Frank, this just came in too.

316
00:31:22,853 --> 00:31:26,899
We got a make on the getaway car -
chequered sedan, '66, '67,

317
00:31:26,983 --> 00:31:29,818
crumpled right fender, painted black, lot of rust.

318
00:31:29,903 --> 00:31:33,520
- Does the lieutenant have this?
- No. I thought it'd be better...

319
00:31:33,614 --> 00:31:37,660
- I appreciate what you're trying to do.
- Why let him take the credit?

320
00:31:37,744 --> 00:31:40,994
Dave, this is his operation. But thanks.

321
00:31:42,916 --> 00:31:45,537
The Captain will be here shortly.

322
00:31:45,627 --> 00:31:48,415
- Captain.
- Hi, Charley. Why are you here?

323
00:31:49,673 --> 00:31:52,544
- Sidney's here? Who brought him in?
- Yeah.

324
00:31:52,634 --> 00:31:57,379
- All right. Marti, ma che fai qua?
- Sto vigliacco m'ha arrestato per niente!

325
00:31:57,472 --> 00:31:59,346
- Arrestato perché?
- Per niente.

326
00:31:59,432 --> 00:32:01,473
- What's the charge?
- Making a book.

327
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:04,229
Book? He can't even read! Let him go.

328
00:32:05,189 --> 00:32:10,645
- Macché tuo padre!
- Quante volte ti ho detto, eh? Allora vai via.

329
00:32:10,736 --> 00:32:13,274
- Let him go.
- Chief, I gotta talk to you.

330
00:32:13,364 --> 00:32:16,982
I'm not taking any stuff,
they just dragged me in here.

331
00:32:17,076 --> 00:32:19,745
- Really? OK, I'll take care of it.
- Yeah.

332
00:32:20,496 --> 00:32:22,702
Honey, will you cover your tits?

333
00:32:24,834 --> 00:32:27,539
- Listen, I've been straight.
- I warned you.

334
00:32:27,628 --> 00:32:30,665
- He was lying, man.
- You got any shit on you?

335
00:32:30,756 --> 00:32:33,426
Hell no, man. I said I'm straight.

336
00:32:33,509 --> 00:32:35,715
Charley, can't you see I'm busy?

337
00:32:35,803 --> 00:32:38,840
- But nobody...
- I'll take care of it.

338
00:32:38,932 --> 00:32:41,849
Just stay clean. I'll take care of it, Charley.

339
00:32:43,102 --> 00:32:45,391
I swear, I didn't see anything.

340
00:32:46,105 --> 00:32:48,976
There's a machine gun going
and you heard nothing?

341
00:32:49,066 --> 00:32:51,854
No. Man, you must be new around here.

342
00:32:51,945 --> 00:32:54,103
How you doing, Lieutenant?

343
00:32:54,781 --> 00:32:56,820
- I'm getting there.
- That's good.

344
00:32:56,908 --> 00:32:59,363
- How are you, Sidney?
- How are you, Captain?

345
00:32:59,452 --> 00:33:04,329
I've known this man for years,
he's harmless. I'll vouch for him.

346
00:33:05,417 --> 00:33:08,334
Go on, Sidney. Charley's hysterical.

347
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:11,919
Thank God.

348
00:33:12,924 --> 00:33:15,381
Pope, I know this punk. Can I be of any help?

349
00:33:15,469 --> 00:33:17,177
No, thank you, Captain.

350
00:33:17,263 --> 00:33:20,678
Chink, we've tangled before.
Answer this man's questions.

351
00:33:20,766 --> 00:33:22,593
Captain, please.

352
00:33:22,684 --> 00:33:25,305
I'm just trying to help you both.

353
00:33:31,277 --> 00:33:33,316
At 3:47,

354
00:33:33,404 --> 00:33:38,231
more than 150 rounds of ammunition were fired
into your apartment 200 yards away.

355
00:33:38,325 --> 00:33:42,822
A few moments later, another 50 to 75 rounds
were fired in the street

356
00:33:42,914 --> 00:33:45,155
in a direct sightline from your newsstand.

357
00:33:45,249 --> 00:33:47,325
Two policemen were killed.

358
00:33:48,085 --> 00:33:52,333
A car drove down the street and passed
ten feet from where you were,

359
00:33:52,424 --> 00:33:55,341
turned to the right and went in front of you,

360
00:33:55,426 --> 00:33:58,344
and you're gonna tell me you didn't see a thing?

361
00:33:58,429 --> 00:34:02,379
Brother, I'd rather talk to you
than a racist honky pig, man.

362
00:34:02,475 --> 00:34:04,931
Why won't you believe me, man?

363
00:34:05,020 --> 00:34:08,270
Don't give me that brother crap.
I asked you a question.

364
00:34:08,356 --> 00:34:11,392
How can you be deaf,
dumb and blind for five hours?

365
00:34:11,484 --> 00:34:13,975
I didn't see anything.

366
00:34:14,070 --> 00:34:17,689
I'll break every bone in your body
if you don't answer this man.

367
00:34:17,783 --> 00:34:20,737
You'd better answer this man's questions.

368
00:34:23,288 --> 00:34:26,408
- I said I didn't need your help and I meant it.
- OK. OK.

369
00:34:26,499 --> 00:34:28,623
We'll play it your way, Pope.

370
00:34:28,711 --> 00:34:30,750
What have you come up with, huh?

371
00:34:32,548 --> 00:34:34,789
- We're getting there.
- Oh, you are?

372
00:34:34,883 --> 00:34:37,089
My boys came up with this.

373
00:34:45,603 --> 00:34:47,891
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

374
00:34:49,023 --> 00:34:52,439
- Here, put out an all-units on this.
- Yes, sir.

375
00:34:52,527 --> 00:34:54,650
Goodbye, Captain.

376
00:34:56,572 --> 00:34:58,648
OK, Mr Pope.

377
00:35:07,292 --> 00:35:08,952
Money, baby!

378
00:35:09,043 --> 00:35:11,202
Money!

379
00:35:15,299 --> 00:35:17,873
Tell me something, Henry, tell me something.

380
00:35:17,969 --> 00:35:20,756
- What?
- Where'd you get all that?

381
00:35:20,847 --> 00:35:23,848
I won first prize in a beauty contest.

382
00:35:25,310 --> 00:35:26,590
Money!

383
00:35:32,484 --> 00:35:34,690
You must've gone crazy.

384
00:35:36,905 --> 00:35:38,944
Crazy?

385
00:35:41,869 --> 00:35:44,075
Maybe.

386
00:35:44,163 --> 00:35:46,321
But we won, Gloria.

387
00:35:47,332 --> 00:35:49,455
We won.

388
00:35:57,301 --> 00:36:01,133
I didn't wanna kill nobody. It wasn't in the plan.

389
00:36:02,389 --> 00:36:04,547
Give it back.

390
00:36:11,691 --> 00:36:14,857
I'd rather see you in jail than dead.

391
00:36:14,944 --> 00:36:19,073
At least I could see you.
They ain't executed nobody in ten years.

392
00:36:19,157 --> 00:36:21,363
Give the mob back the money.

393
00:36:21,451 --> 00:36:26,990
I can't give the mob back the five men I shot.
Or the cops back their two.

394
00:36:27,081 --> 00:36:29,619
- They don't make deals.
- Money talks.

395
00:36:29,709 --> 00:36:33,292
- The dead are dead but you can deal with it.
- Gloria.

396
00:36:33,380 --> 00:36:37,247
I always figured you
a step and a half ahead of the pack

397
00:36:37,342 --> 00:36:39,714
but you sound like all the other dumb broads.

398
00:36:39,802 --> 00:36:43,552
- You don't stand a chance.
- I ain't giving nothing back.

399
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:46,131
Not one dime.

400
00:36:46,226 --> 00:36:48,895
You don't stand a chance of living out the week.

401
00:36:48,979 --> 00:36:52,513
What do you mean, we don't stand a chance
of living out the week?

402
00:36:52,607 --> 00:36:56,819
We didn't stand a chance of spotting
that Cadillac but we did.

403
00:36:56,904 --> 00:37:02,693
We didn't stand a chance of it being
the same fat-faced accountant but it was.

404
00:37:02,784 --> 00:37:07,910
You see, like, not a chance in hell of walking into
that room and coming out alive,

405
00:37:07,999 --> 00:37:10,038
much less with 300,000,

406
00:37:10,126 --> 00:37:12,165
but we did.

407
00:37:12,253 --> 00:37:16,332
And now you're talking about we don't have
a chance of living out the week.

408
00:37:16,423 --> 00:37:18,463
No chance at all?

409
00:37:19,636 --> 00:37:21,877
Well, I'm rolling.

410
00:37:21,971 --> 00:37:25,921
You see? I made my point, ten times today,

411
00:37:26,017 --> 00:37:28,139
and I've still got the dice.

412
00:37:28,227 --> 00:37:30,266
And I'm gonna keep on rolling.

413
00:37:32,690 --> 00:37:34,730
Yeah, all right, then.

414
00:37:34,817 --> 00:37:38,815
At first, you told me not to try it,
but you was wrong, bad wrong.

415
00:37:39,739 --> 00:37:42,942
Until six o'clock this evening,
what was sure for me?

416
00:37:43,034 --> 00:37:45,608
I'll tell you what - prison.

417
00:37:45,704 --> 00:37:49,037
Back in the joint again, beating my pud.

418
00:37:49,124 --> 00:37:51,579
Or outside in some assholed job

419
00:37:51,668 --> 00:37:54,503
like a janitor or a porter.

420
00:37:54,587 --> 00:37:58,087
You know, cleaning up
after some goddamn white man.

421
00:37:58,175 --> 00:38:00,666
That was sure. That was dead sure.

422
00:38:00,761 --> 00:38:02,587
You would've gotten a job.

423
00:38:02,679 --> 00:38:04,387
Look at me.

424
00:38:05,348 --> 00:38:07,388
Look at me!

425
00:38:08,226 --> 00:38:12,094
You're looking at a 42-year-old ex-con nigger,

426
00:38:12,189 --> 00:38:16,233
with no schooling, no trade,
and a medical problem.

427
00:38:16,318 --> 00:38:21,146
Who would want me for anything
but washing cars or swinging a pick?

428
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:24,941
You've gotta get your mind
out of that white woman's dream.

429
00:38:47,350 --> 00:38:50,470
It was gonna be one nothing job after another.

430
00:38:58,111 --> 00:39:00,567
And you'd be working in that club,

431
00:39:03,283 --> 00:39:07,861
still being propositioned every night.

432
00:39:11,541 --> 00:39:13,830
How long would it be before we...

433
00:39:14,753 --> 00:39:17,707
we needed the bread so bad
that I'd tell you to do it?

434
00:39:19,841 --> 00:39:21,668
Huh?

435
00:40:42,009 --> 00:40:45,958
Got any numbers on it?
Not a number on it anywhere.

436
00:40:52,228 --> 00:40:55,561
- What have you found?
- I can't find a thing, Lieutenant.

437
00:41:03,155 --> 00:41:05,729
Get over here, come on.

438
00:41:08,702 --> 00:41:13,448
Listen, you know where the NYPD garage is
on Center Street?

439
00:41:13,541 --> 00:41:16,079
That's a 40-dollar tow job.

440
00:41:16,169 --> 00:41:21,874
I ain't going on no 40-dollar tow
without a written paper from somebody in charge.

441
00:41:26,554 --> 00:41:28,843
I'm somebody in charge.

442
00:41:31,059 --> 00:41:34,677
I'm taking it down the precinct garage,
no further.

443
00:41:47,450 --> 00:41:52,279
You son of a bitch! Come back here!

444
00:42:12,934 --> 00:42:16,600
Hey, Shevvy. Guy on the phone,
says his name is Howard Jello.

445
00:42:16,689 --> 00:42:20,022
Yeah, I know him. He's a cop with a big mouth.

446
00:42:24,863 --> 00:42:28,613
- Shevvy.
- Hey, man, I hear you been missing me.

447
00:42:29,786 --> 00:42:33,451
- When you coming back uptown?
- Soon as I get reassigned.

448
00:42:33,539 --> 00:42:35,579
I'm starving to death downtown.

449
00:42:37,918 --> 00:42:41,917
I work at headquarters.
We got the make on the getaway car.

450
00:42:42,006 --> 00:42:44,046
And we got the make on the owners.

451
00:42:44,133 --> 00:42:48,213
- 'I hear you'd pay pretty good for this. '
- One bill for name of owner.

452
00:42:50,431 --> 00:42:54,180
Well, a bill's better
than what I've been doing down here.

453
00:42:55,687 --> 00:42:57,679
Mr and Mrs...

454
00:42:58,732 --> 00:43:03,061
Glenn W Fears.

455
00:43:09,576 --> 00:43:12,446
- Is your name Glenn Fears?
- Yep.

456
00:43:13,622 --> 00:43:15,910
Do you own a 1966 chequered sedan?

457
00:43:15,999 --> 00:43:18,039
I got rid of that car last week.

458
00:43:18,711 --> 00:43:22,079
- Seven men were killed.
- I had nothing to do with that.

459
00:43:22,172 --> 00:43:25,588
Glenn, you drove that getaway car, didn't you?

460
00:43:25,676 --> 00:43:28,381
- No, I didn't drive it.
- I know you drove that car.

461
00:43:28,471 --> 00:43:30,796
Your ass, I did.

462
00:43:35,811 --> 00:43:37,554
Mattelli!

463
00:43:41,776 --> 00:43:43,815
What the hell are you doing?

464
00:43:43,903 --> 00:43:48,197
- This junkie drove the getaway car.
- I swear to God I didn't.

465
00:43:48,908 --> 00:43:50,734
Fears.

466
00:43:54,748 --> 00:43:58,247
You don't have to answer any questions
without a lawyer.

467
00:43:58,334 --> 00:44:00,374
You're entitled to an attorney.

468
00:44:00,461 --> 00:44:02,999
I'm-a get me a lawyer
and sic him dead on your ass.

469
00:44:03,089 --> 00:44:05,331
- I'll give you lawyer!
- Yelping.

470
00:44:07,511 --> 00:44:10,547
- This kind of thing went out with Prohibition.
- Look...

471
00:44:10,639 --> 00:44:13,556
I'm sick and tired of your liberal bullshit.

472
00:44:13,641 --> 00:44:17,510
Make up your mind -
are you a cop or one of them social workers?

473
00:44:17,604 --> 00:44:19,561
All right, Captain.

474
00:44:20,232 --> 00:44:22,723
Go back to 1940.

475
00:44:22,818 --> 00:44:27,111
Pull out the powder keg,
blow up the whole goddamn community.

476
00:44:28,406 --> 00:44:31,741
Look, the way I work gets results.

477
00:44:33,537 --> 00:44:35,743
I don't hear him saying a goddamn thing.

478
00:44:41,253 --> 00:44:43,293
No shit.

479
00:44:47,176 --> 00:44:49,797
Now he didn't tell them nothing, right?

480
00:44:49,887 --> 00:44:53,053
Told me he didn't say a thing.

481
00:44:53,140 --> 00:44:56,142
Mrs Fears, this is our friend, Nick.

482
00:44:56,227 --> 00:44:59,596
Mrs Fears, it's a real pleasure to see you here.

483
00:44:59,689 --> 00:45:03,307
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

484
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:07,316
Now, Mrs Fears, Doc is gonna show
his gratefulness real good.

485
00:45:08,531 --> 00:45:11,615
Now, who did your husband sell the car to?

486
00:45:55,120 --> 00:45:58,537
Get me some gin and some champagne
over there.

487
00:45:58,624 --> 00:46:03,167
- Get me some champagne.
- Oh, Lord have mercy!

488
00:46:03,253 --> 00:46:05,293
Champagne.

489
00:46:07,049 --> 00:46:10,465
Yeah. Give me another glass, too.

490
00:46:13,806 --> 00:46:15,882
Whoa. Easy.

491
00:46:15,975 --> 00:46:17,801
Whoo!

492
00:46:18,519 --> 00:46:20,678
Ah, how you doing?

493
00:47:04,483 --> 00:47:06,855
Hey, nigger!

494
00:47:11,407 --> 00:47:14,858
- Is that the man?
- Don't make me no never mind.

495
00:47:18,038 --> 00:47:21,823
You want your brains all over that wall, brother?

496
00:47:21,918 --> 00:47:23,709
Are you talking to me, white man?

497
00:47:23,795 --> 00:47:26,416
That's right, nigger, I'm talking to you.

498
00:47:27,381 --> 00:47:31,842
I answer to the name of Mr Jackson.
And that's all I answer to.

499
00:47:31,927 --> 00:47:34,134
- No shit.
- M-hm.

500
00:47:34,222 --> 00:47:36,261
Hey, look at that.

501
00:47:36,349 --> 00:47:39,433
- Ain't that cute? That's a cutie.
- It's nice.

502
00:47:39,519 --> 00:47:43,302
That's a beauty.
You gonna buy us a couple of snorts?

503
00:47:43,397 --> 00:47:47,775
I hear you've been acting
like a real big man around here.

504
00:47:47,861 --> 00:47:50,067
- He is.
- Ain't that right, boy?

505
00:47:50,780 --> 00:47:53,532
Who are you boying?

506
00:47:57,495 --> 00:48:00,746
- He's a cutie, ain't he? Ain't he a cutie?
- He's a doll.

507
00:48:02,959 --> 00:48:04,999
Aah! Aah!

508
00:48:07,380 --> 00:48:09,420
Now!

509
00:48:26,150 --> 00:48:29,519
Let him go. Let him go.

510
00:48:43,876 --> 00:48:46,201
Get up. Head up.

511
00:49:00,268 --> 00:49:03,851
Get up. Get up, you dirty bastard. Get up.

512
00:49:25,461 --> 00:49:27,500
Get me my coat, Frank.

513
00:49:36,805 --> 00:49:38,845
All right, get him out of here.

514
00:49:39,642 --> 00:49:43,141
We'll take care of him some more.
Get him out of here.

515
00:49:52,154 --> 00:49:55,357
Anybody here... seen anything?

516
00:50:10,923 --> 00:50:14,127
- Can you hear me?
- He needs plasma. Hold that.

517
00:50:14,219 --> 00:50:16,258
Tell me your name, brother.

518
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:21,725
Tell me, who done this to you?
Boy, I'm trying to help you.

519
00:50:21,809 --> 00:50:23,849
- Will he make it?
- I'm doing my best.

520
00:50:23,936 --> 00:50:29,607
Was it a brother or was he white?
Tell me, boy, cos I'm trying to help you.

521
00:50:29,693 --> 00:50:32,647
Tell me, was it a brother or was it a whitey?

522
00:50:32,737 --> 00:50:36,320
Help me! Help me, Jimbo!

523
00:50:36,407 --> 00:50:38,734
Jim?

524
00:50:38,827 --> 00:50:41,781
- Wait a minute. Boy, tell me.
- Jim.

525
00:50:41,872 --> 00:50:43,995
Jim who?

526
00:50:44,082 --> 00:50:47,533
You gotta tell me, boy, cos you're dying.

527
00:50:48,378 --> 00:50:51,546
You dumb bastard, I tell you...

528
00:51:04,562 --> 00:51:06,768
There's no pulse now.

529
00:51:25,332 --> 00:51:27,124
No more crucifixions.

530
00:51:28,795 --> 00:51:32,246
My people don't crucify anybody, Frank.

531
00:51:32,340 --> 00:51:34,913
Crucifying's wop shit.

532
00:51:35,009 --> 00:51:37,168
Doc...

533
00:51:38,137 --> 00:51:40,296
no more crucifixions.

534
00:51:45,478 --> 00:51:47,850
Am I hearing you right?

535
00:51:48,648 --> 00:51:52,433
- Are you giving me orders?
- You're goddamn right I am.

536
00:51:54,571 --> 00:51:57,323
- Show him out, Shevvy.
- Who the fuck do you?

537
00:51:57,407 --> 00:51:59,696
No, Captain, or I'll blow your brains...

538
00:52:01,119 --> 00:52:03,444
Two against two. That's fair.

539
00:52:04,749 --> 00:52:06,907
You be happy, Frank.

540
00:52:08,377 --> 00:52:12,291
The last sucker that put his hands on me lost.

541
00:52:16,969 --> 00:52:20,006
Hi. You're new here, ain't you?

542
00:52:21,223 --> 00:52:23,430
College boy?

543
00:52:23,517 --> 00:52:27,052
- Two years.
- Right on, baby.

544
00:52:27,146 --> 00:52:29,056
Yeah.

545
00:52:37,365 --> 00:52:40,200
I could get you his job.

546
00:52:45,623 --> 00:52:48,957
They're looking for
bright black boys on the force.

547
00:52:50,878 --> 00:52:53,750
How much are we paying this dude, Shevvy?

548
00:52:53,840 --> 00:52:56,925
He's the guy that sent back
the Christmas present.

549
00:52:57,010 --> 00:53:01,138
Yeah? Mr Mattelli don't do that.

550
00:53:03,558 --> 00:53:07,687
We've been giving him 2,500 a month
for the past two years.

551
00:53:11,441 --> 00:53:14,608
And he come in here, giving me orders. Shit.

552
00:53:14,694 --> 00:53:16,983
He works for me.

553
00:53:18,449 --> 00:53:22,233
He works for me,
the same as the whores and the dealers.

554
00:53:24,621 --> 00:53:28,239
- I only took gambling money.
- Yeah, they all say that.

555
00:53:28,333 --> 00:53:34,953
No. No, you don't take whoring money,
you don't take dirty junkie money.

556
00:53:35,049 --> 00:53:38,299
You only take nice, clean numbers money.

557
00:53:39,094 --> 00:53:42,130
Where do you think it comes from?
The men below us.

558
00:53:42,639 --> 00:53:47,219
Dirty money or clean money, it's all the same.
Now get the hell out of here.

559
00:53:47,979 --> 00:53:50,648
Look, I came to give you a message.

560
00:53:50,731 --> 00:53:53,934
If you're too dumb to understand,
that's your business.

561
00:53:54,026 --> 00:53:57,478
Any more bodies, I'm coming after you.
You hear me?

562
00:53:57,572 --> 00:54:01,071
You watch your motherfucking mouth, white boy.

563
00:54:01,159 --> 00:54:05,737
You might be something big
to those booty-butts at the station

564
00:54:05,830 --> 00:54:08,156
but, goddamn it, this is me.

565
00:54:08,250 --> 00:54:10,538
Doc motherfucking Johnson.

566
00:54:12,337 --> 00:54:16,915
You come running in here
because a couple of your cops got nined.

567
00:54:17,508 --> 00:54:19,881
Especially because one was white.

568
00:54:22,264 --> 00:54:25,181
Your friend is a racist son of a bitch.

569
00:54:25,267 --> 00:54:27,722
He always has been. They all are.

570
00:54:29,646 --> 00:54:33,181
If you're smart, you'll stick with me.

571
00:54:37,446 --> 00:54:39,522
Hey, Shevvy,

572
00:54:40,699 --> 00:54:42,822
give him a taste.

573
00:55:00,052 --> 00:55:02,294
Hey, come on.

574
00:55:03,014 --> 00:55:06,797
Don't waste your career on the force, my boy.

575
00:55:08,185 --> 00:55:09,811
Take the money, brother.

576
00:55:12,941 --> 00:55:15,692
You stick it up your ass, brother.

577
00:55:19,196 --> 00:55:21,237
Ah, well, OK.

578
00:55:23,827 --> 00:55:26,578
Take the old man home.

579
00:55:30,750 --> 00:55:33,918
Stand up, you bastard. I'll show you how old I am.

580
00:55:34,004 --> 00:55:38,048
Go on, pull it.
Pull it, you motherfucking Johnson.

581
00:55:38,133 --> 00:55:40,422
Go on, pull it.

582
00:55:40,510 --> 00:55:43,262
You're crazy, Mattelli.

583
00:55:43,346 --> 00:55:47,475
You don't wanna keep on living. You wanna die.

584
00:55:48,394 --> 00:55:50,600
I'm not gonna help you.

585
00:55:53,440 --> 00:55:56,310
Hey, boy, see where my hands are.

586
00:55:58,779 --> 00:56:01,733
Shevvy, show him out.

587
00:56:03,951 --> 00:56:06,821
- Look, Doc...
- So long, Mattelli.

588
00:56:07,996 --> 00:56:10,036
Been nice knowing you.

589
00:56:11,709 --> 00:56:13,120
Captain.

590
00:56:14,212 --> 00:56:15,670
Let's go.

591
00:56:38,695 --> 00:56:40,734
Goddamn clown.

592
00:56:47,663 --> 00:56:49,739
OK, Mr Pope.

593
00:56:50,707 --> 00:56:52,865
Now we can go.

594
00:56:57,422 --> 00:56:59,961
I don't know why I bother keeping them clean.

595
00:57:00,050 --> 00:57:04,262
- Pride of service.
- Some wino will puke on this by midnight.

596
00:57:05,889 --> 00:57:09,139
Do you hear they found
some poor bastard crucified?

597
00:57:09,226 --> 00:57:12,144
They think it's one of the guys
that did the hit today.

598
00:57:12,229 --> 00:57:15,515
- How do they know who it was?
- Fingerprints.

599
00:57:16,859 --> 00:57:18,982
Guy named Jackson.

600
00:57:20,404 --> 00:57:22,443
Hey, come on, come on, huh?

601
00:57:23,365 --> 00:57:25,904
- How much?
- A dollar seven, with tax.

602
00:57:28,246 --> 00:57:30,487
Screw the tax - here's a buck.

603
00:57:36,003 --> 00:57:38,625
- Yeah. Even cut his balls off.
- Wow.

604
00:57:55,648 --> 00:57:58,768
'... 57 persons aboard.
An airport spokesman said... '

605
00:58:02,155 --> 00:58:05,773
How would you like to live in this toilet, Mattelli?

606
00:58:05,867 --> 00:58:09,034
I did, Mr Pope. I did.

607
00:58:26,305 --> 00:58:29,472
- Yes?
- Mrs Jackson?

608
00:58:29,558 --> 00:58:33,223
- Yes?
- We're police officers, Mrs Jackson.

609
00:58:33,312 --> 00:58:35,518
- What?
- Police.

610
00:58:40,987 --> 00:58:43,145
Mrs Henry J Jackson?

611
00:58:46,784 --> 00:58:50,070
- We don't have any trouble here.
- Can we come in?

612
00:58:55,460 --> 00:58:57,499
Please.

613
00:59:11,601 --> 00:59:14,270
Came to ask about a friend of your husband's.

614
00:59:14,938 --> 00:59:17,097
His name is Jim.

615
00:59:17,774 --> 00:59:21,143
- Ask Henry J.
- You must know somebody named Jim.

616
00:59:21,236 --> 00:59:25,280
Henry J is at his garage
on 137th Street and St Nick. Ask him.

617
00:59:25,365 --> 00:59:27,738
I don't know nothing about no Jim.

618
00:59:27,826 --> 00:59:31,195
Mrs Jackson, are you
and your husband separated?

619
00:59:31,288 --> 00:59:35,784
We haven't been together
for a couple of months but we're not separated.

620
00:59:37,002 --> 00:59:40,537
Mrs Jackson, I don't know
how to tell you this but...

621
00:59:41,841 --> 00:59:44,047
your husband is dead.

622
00:59:44,134 --> 00:59:46,341
I'm... I'm very sorry.

623
00:59:58,858 --> 01:00:02,061
- How did he die?
- The fact is that...

624
01:00:02,152 --> 01:00:04,609
It was an automobile accident.

625
01:00:06,824 --> 01:00:08,947
Hit and run.

626
01:00:14,248 --> 01:00:18,709
- Her husband is dead.
- Yes, I know.

627
01:00:31,767 --> 01:00:33,593
Mrs Jackson,

628
01:00:33,685 --> 01:00:36,223
now about this fella, Jim.

629
01:00:36,312 --> 01:00:38,684
Can you tell us anything about him?

630
01:00:44,154 --> 01:00:48,946
- You kids have an uncle named Jim, huh?
- The kid doesn't have anything to do with this.

631
01:00:49,034 --> 01:00:52,284
He used to call him "big fella".

632
01:00:53,581 --> 01:00:57,032
Big fella. I didn't know him.

633
01:00:57,126 --> 01:00:59,284
Uh,

634
01:00:59,378 --> 01:01:01,335
I didn't know him.

635
01:01:01,421 --> 01:01:03,959
He said he was over six foot, though.

636
01:01:04,966 --> 01:01:08,965
Henry J, he called him...
His name was Jim Harris.

637
01:01:10,389 --> 01:01:12,298
Jim...

638
01:01:12,391 --> 01:01:14,597
Um...

639
01:01:14,685 --> 01:01:16,891
He used to visit him in jail, even.

640
01:01:19,524 --> 01:01:21,730
He gonna be in there for years and years.

641
01:01:23,319 --> 01:01:25,358
Mrs Jackson.

642
01:01:27,323 --> 01:01:31,736
The coroner's office will be
getting in contact with you.

643
01:01:31,828 --> 01:01:34,533
Will they make a fuss when I go downtown?

644
01:01:36,791 --> 01:01:41,085
We didn't have no paper.
We were common-law.

645
01:01:41,170 --> 01:01:44,457
They want you to identify
and claim the body. That's all.

646
01:01:44,549 --> 01:01:46,791
That won't be necessary.

647
01:01:46,885 --> 01:01:53,005
If you have any trouble, just go
to the 27th precinct and ask for Frank Mattelli.

648
01:01:56,186 --> 01:01:58,760
You want me to write it down for you?

649
01:02:00,399 --> 01:02:02,438
No, I can remember. Thank you.

650
01:02:08,741 --> 01:02:10,733
Jim Harris, huh?

651
01:02:15,080 --> 01:02:19,707
Look, this was in your husband's pocket
when we found him.

652
01:02:19,794 --> 01:02:22,035
I guess it belongs to you now.

653
01:04:02,857 --> 01:04:05,941
His name's Logart. Joe Logart.

654
01:04:22,294 --> 01:04:24,666
Hey, Jim, it's me.

655
01:04:28,175 --> 01:04:30,630
Jim, you in there?

656
01:04:32,804 --> 01:04:35,556
Jim, it's Joe.

657
01:04:38,685 --> 01:04:40,844
They got Henry J.

658
01:04:51,323 --> 01:04:53,530
They castrated his balls.

659
01:05:00,792 --> 01:05:02,950
You taking off?

660
01:05:08,299 --> 01:05:10,505
You gotta figure he talked.

661
01:05:12,011 --> 01:05:14,051
Maybe.

662
01:05:16,182 --> 01:05:19,183
We always figured,
if they got one of us, you know?

663
01:05:19,268 --> 01:05:22,388
Anybody start fucking with my balls, I'd talk.

664
01:05:24,232 --> 01:05:26,272
Yeah.

665
01:05:33,282 --> 01:05:36,201
I figure they'd be looking hardest in the ghettos.

666
01:05:38,455 --> 01:05:40,613
I'm getting out, man.

667
01:05:43,210 --> 01:05:46,910
- I got a friend in New Jersey...
- I don't want to know.

668
01:05:51,176 --> 01:05:52,884
Yeah.

669
01:06:01,020 --> 01:06:03,059
You OK?

670
01:06:06,442 --> 01:06:09,810
I kind of went to pieces
on you up there, didn't I?

671
01:06:11,154 --> 01:06:13,611
Thanks for pulling me out of it, man.

672
01:06:18,871 --> 01:06:23,533
- I just didn't think it'd be that rough.
- Forget it, Joe. It's over.

673
01:06:26,254 --> 01:06:29,374
We got what we went after, and we're still alive.

674
01:06:31,134 --> 01:06:35,676
It didn't start hitting me
until we started to climb them stairs, man.

675
01:06:39,476 --> 01:06:42,393
Everything seemed so shaky, you know?

676
01:06:52,572 --> 01:06:54,731
And those shots, man.

677
01:06:57,702 --> 01:06:59,778
Those shots.

678
01:07:04,043 --> 01:07:06,165
And my legs, Jimbo.

679
01:07:06,253 --> 01:07:10,333
My legs feel like the floor's started
moving from under me.

680
01:07:11,299 --> 01:07:15,168
I said forget it. It's over and done with.

681
01:07:19,099 --> 01:07:21,139
Yeah, well...

682
01:07:22,102 --> 01:07:25,269
Whatever happens, man, we gonna end up rich.

683
01:07:29,277 --> 01:07:31,649
But dead, man.

684
01:07:32,988 --> 01:07:35,147
There ain't no better way.

685
01:07:45,585 --> 01:07:47,791
You take care, brother.

686
01:08:11,361 --> 01:08:13,270
Hiya, boys.

687
01:08:16,492 --> 01:08:19,030
- Hiya, Stenner.
- Captain, how are you?

688
01:08:19,119 --> 01:08:21,527
- How you doing?
- I'm checking the Harrises.

689
01:08:21,622 --> 01:08:25,322
- There are over 300.
- 300 Jim Harrises?

690
01:08:25,417 --> 01:08:27,456
So what have you come up with?

691
01:08:27,544 --> 01:08:29,751
That's Pope, Lieutenant Pope.

692
01:08:29,839 --> 01:08:34,547
According to the stuff you told me,
I've got it narrowed down to three.

693
01:08:35,302 --> 01:08:40,261
Here's their pictures.
I'm just getting ready now to pull their files.

694
01:08:48,399 --> 01:08:50,438
You know any of these cats?

695
01:08:51,318 --> 01:08:53,775
No, I haven't seen any guy like this.

696
01:08:53,863 --> 01:08:56,698
- Thought they might be friends of yours.
- No.

697
01:08:58,826 --> 01:09:01,282
They all look alike to me.

698
01:09:01,370 --> 01:09:03,576
Yeah, I thought you'd say that.

699
01:09:05,750 --> 01:09:08,502
OK, now.

01:09:08,586 --> 01:09:10,994

01:09:16,719 --> 01:09:19,389
B 256-107.

702
01:09:24,519 --> 01:09:26,558

This guy died three months ago!

710
01:10:05,602 --> 01:10:10,348
- Captain, there's no way of knowing...
- Get the next one.

711
01:10:12,235 --> 01:10:14,274

Last case handled by Thompson,

01:10:42,515 --> 01:10:44,639
Let me see that.

719
01:10:47,229 --> 01:10:50,479
- He could be our man.
- What?

720
01:10:50,565 --> 01:10:54,942
- I said he could be our man.
- Yeah, could be.

721
01:10:57,615 --> 01:11:00,568
Run some yellows, get some pictures.

722
01:11:08,584 --> 01:11:10,624

I'm going across 110th Street.

728
01:11:59,219 --> 01:12:02,553
'Read me? I'm going across 110th
to the Port Authority. '

729
01:12:02,639 --> 01:12:05,344
Shevvy, we got a bite - 110th and Central Park.

01:12:05,433 --> 01:12:07,722
Let's go. 110th and Central Park.

You running, too?

Hell, no, I ain't running.

733
01:12:45,015 --> 01:12:48,017
Just that this place ain't too safe any more.

734
01:12:54,025 --> 01:12:56,266
I got me a place all staked out.

735
01:12:57,946 --> 01:13:00,069
Nobody'll ever find me.

736
01:13:04,536 --> 01:13:06,694
It's where I used to live.

737
01:13:08,581 --> 01:13:10,658
You know?

738
01:13:14,796 --> 01:13:16,872
Where we first...

739
01:13:19,426 --> 01:13:21,465
Look, erm...

740
01:13:23,430 --> 01:13:26,515
I'll call you. I don't know when but...

741
01:13:27,810 --> 01:13:30,597
I'll call you. OK?

Damn. My medicine.

746
01:18:07,554 --> 01:18:09,796
I gotta find my medicine, my pills.

747
01:19:39,731 --> 01:19:41,973
- OK, Nick, we got him.
- OK.

748
01:19:43,109 --> 01:19:44,937
Get him up.

749
01:19:45,029 --> 01:19:47,780
Get him up. Get him up, bring him over there.

750
01:19:52,494 --> 01:19:54,403
Aah!

751
01:19:59,669 --> 01:20:02,290
What's this, huh? What's this?

752
01:20:08,887 --> 01:20:11,508
Let's see what else you've got, huh?

01:20:25,487 --> 01:20:28,902
Logart, Joseph. 311 West 141st.

754
01:20:31,159 --> 01:20:33,864
Let's see what's in the bag, pretty boy.

755
01:20:38,124 --> 01:20:40,331
Let's see what's in the bag.

756
01:20:58,062 --> 01:21:01,680
You know what we done to
that friend of yours, Henry J Jackson?

757
01:21:01,774 --> 01:21:04,525
You know what we done to
that nigger creep, huh?

758
01:21:04,610 --> 01:21:08,559
- Kiss my ass.
- Kiss your ass? Sure.

759
01:21:08,655 --> 01:21:11,443
Who was the other spade with you?

760
01:21:11,534 --> 01:21:13,776
Who was the other spade with you, huh?

761
01:21:14,328 --> 01:21:17,863
- What's his name?
- Sammy Davis Jr.

762
01:21:17,957 --> 01:21:22,251
Look at this, we got a funny nigger with us.
Give me that arm.

763
01:21:25,131 --> 01:21:27,373
OK, nigger,

764
01:21:27,466 --> 01:21:29,792
let's see you laugh.

765
01:21:36,017 --> 01:21:38,057
Are you laughing?

766
01:21:43,357 --> 01:21:47,356
Come over here. I wanna talk to you.

767
01:21:48,989 --> 01:21:51,444
You're not talking, are you?

768
01:21:52,575 --> 01:21:57,403
Hey, you wanna see a pretty picture?
You wanna see a pretty scene, huh?

769
01:21:58,539 --> 01:22:02,324
You wanna see some pretty scenery?
Take him over here. Here!

770
01:22:13,889 --> 01:22:15,929
Put him over the edge.

771
01:22:16,016 --> 01:22:18,258
That's it.

772
01:22:18,352 --> 01:22:21,056
Stay right there. Stay right there.

773
01:22:22,189 --> 01:22:24,597
Now who was it? Tell me who it was.

774
01:22:25,651 --> 01:22:29,102
You think I get any kicks out of
wiping you out?

775
01:22:29,196 --> 01:22:32,814
You see any horns up here?
There are no horns. We're not animals.

776
01:22:33,784 --> 01:22:35,528
Tie his legs, tie his legs good.

777
01:22:35,620 --> 01:22:38,621
We're trying to be friends, that's all.

778
01:22:38,706 --> 01:22:44,791
If you don't tell me who it was, you're gonna
make me do something that I don't like.

779
01:22:44,879 --> 01:22:47,167
You're gonna make me feel very bad.

780
01:22:47,256 --> 01:22:50,791
You're not gonna tell me?
You're not gonna tell me?

781
01:22:53,054 --> 01:22:54,881
Hoist him.

782
01:22:54,972 --> 01:22:57,012
No!

783
01:22:58,434 --> 01:23:00,558
Look at that. Can you fly? Huh?

784
01:23:00,645 --> 01:23:04,595
Yeah. Yeah, Look at that, look at that.

785
01:23:04,691 --> 01:23:07,976
Why should you take a drop 20 storeys...

786
01:23:08,736 --> 01:23:10,776
when we're gonna find out anyway?

787
01:23:10,863 --> 01:23:14,992
We're gonna find out. We found Henry J.
We found you here.

788
01:23:15,786 --> 01:23:17,992
Who was it, Joe? Or you drop.

789
01:23:24,461 --> 01:23:28,411
- Hold it.
- Wait a minute!

790
01:23:28,507 --> 01:23:30,665
Come here. No, it's all right.

791
01:23:30,759 --> 01:23:34,210
Just tell me, baby,
and everything will be all right.

792
01:23:35,097 --> 01:23:38,632
That's all right, just tell me. Who was it?

793
01:23:38,726 --> 01:23:41,727
- Who?
- Jim... Harris.

794
01:23:41,812 --> 01:23:43,805
Who? Harris? Jim Harris?

795
01:23:45,816 --> 01:23:49,316
All right, sweetheart. All right, sweetheart.

796
01:23:51,823 --> 01:23:54,064
Jim Harris.

797
01:24:17,098 --> 01:24:19,138
Hello?

798
01:24:19,893 --> 01:24:23,226
My medicine. Where the hell did I put my pills?

799
01:24:23,313 --> 01:24:26,267
I remember. Go back to the room. I'm coming.

800
01:24:33,949 --> 01:24:37,816
There goes Harris's broad.
She's gonna take us right to him.

801
01:24:51,008 --> 01:24:53,215
Jim?

802
01:24:55,262 --> 01:24:57,302
Gloria.

803
01:24:58,057 --> 01:25:00,547
Glori...

804
01:25:02,978 --> 01:25:05,814
- It's all right.
- After all that planning...

805
01:25:05,898 --> 01:25:07,938
I forgot my medicine.

806
01:25:09,527 --> 01:25:12,314
- It's all right.
- Gloria...

807
01:25:12,404 --> 01:25:15,940
Darling, it's all right, don't talk.

808
01:25:16,034 --> 01:25:18,703
I ain't never gonna leave you alone again.

809
01:25:19,829 --> 01:25:22,071
Right there.

810
01:25:22,165 --> 01:25:24,916
637 Lennox Avenue.

811
01:25:25,001 --> 01:25:28,417
He's holed up on the fifth floor
of the empty tenement.

812
01:25:28,505 --> 01:25:30,877
- Is the girl still in there?
- Right.

813
01:25:30,966 --> 01:25:33,172
Lucky son of a bitch.

814
01:25:39,807 --> 01:25:42,477
Hey, Pope, can I see you a second?

815
01:25:47,357 --> 01:25:49,396
Come in, will you?

816
01:25:53,030 --> 01:25:55,153
It's been a long goddamn night.

817
01:25:56,033 --> 01:25:58,156
Pope, I want to talk to you.

818
01:25:59,369 --> 01:26:02,240
I want you to understand...

819
01:26:02,330 --> 01:26:05,996
Do you want a drink?

820
01:26:06,836 --> 01:26:09,124
No, I don't drink.

821
01:26:09,713 --> 01:26:12,038
You will, Pope. You will.

822
01:26:19,182 --> 01:26:23,013
Monday I'll give you all the facts,
names and figures.

823
01:26:23,102 --> 01:26:26,056
- I just don't...
- Wait a minute. Why?

824
01:26:28,107 --> 01:26:30,147
Cos I'm 55.

825
01:26:31,236 --> 01:26:33,358
Put in 33 years, and...

826
01:26:34,447 --> 01:26:36,605
I think it's time to quit.

827
01:26:40,661 --> 01:26:44,707
I want to retire.
And I don't want you to use anything...

828
01:26:46,334 --> 01:26:50,118
- I want you to stop patronising me.
- What are you talking about?

829
01:26:55,802 --> 01:26:58,174
You really are a racist son of a bitch.

830
01:26:58,263 --> 01:27:00,006
Will you cut out that racist crap?

831
01:27:00,098 --> 01:27:03,383
Because I'm black,
I'm gonna blow the whistle on you?

832
01:27:03,476 --> 01:27:06,098
- You want my job, don't you?
- Yes!

833
01:27:06,855 --> 01:27:08,184
Yes.

834
01:27:09,942 --> 01:27:12,148
Not like that, Mattelli.

835
01:27:13,987 --> 01:27:16,110
I want it on my terms.

836
01:27:20,244 --> 01:27:24,953
- I just thought that...
- When are you gonna start looking at me as a cop?

837
01:27:30,838 --> 01:27:32,878
Mattelli here.

838
01:27:34,425 --> 01:27:36,916
Hey, hey, Pope. Hold it.

839
01:27:39,305 --> 01:27:41,381
It's for you.

840
01:27:47,063 --> 01:27:48,640
Pope here.

841
01:27:48,731 --> 01:27:51,187
If you use this right what I'm gonna tell you,

842
01:27:51,275 --> 01:27:54,193
you can be detective first grade in a month.

843
01:27:54,278 --> 01:27:56,485
You've got five seconds. Say it.

844
01:27:57,198 --> 01:28:00,365
Move fast and you can get Harris.

845
01:28:00,452 --> 01:28:04,864
He's holed up in the fifth floor
of the empty tenement at 637 Lennox Avenue.

846
01:28:13,798 --> 01:28:16,336
He's trying to suck us into something.

847
01:28:16,426 --> 01:28:18,584
He's telling you you're in and I'm out.

848
01:28:21,306 --> 01:28:25,174
Pope, the bill comes later.

849
01:28:25,269 --> 01:28:27,806
Screw him. I won't pay it.

850
01:28:28,522 --> 01:28:31,688
Branco, Jeffries, Brooks, let's go!

851
01:28:31,775 --> 01:28:35,939
- Harris is holed up at 637 Lennox Avenue.
- I guess that's TPF.

852
01:28:36,030 --> 01:28:40,775
Get flak vests, sharpshooters,
tear gas, the whole goddamn thing.

853
01:28:42,577 --> 01:28:44,951
All right...

854
01:28:48,084 --> 01:28:50,491
Captain.

855
01:28:50,586 --> 01:28:52,744
Are you coming?

856
01:29:36,925 --> 01:29:40,674
Jim? Jim, are you asleep?

857
01:29:43,848 --> 01:29:45,889
Jim?

858
01:29:47,353 --> 01:29:50,140
Dead men hate soup.

859
01:29:50,230 --> 01:29:53,813
- Faker.
- Need love.

860
01:29:54,526 --> 01:29:56,602
- Make love with me.
- No.

861
01:29:57,320 --> 01:29:59,444
I'll keep in touch.

862
01:30:03,411 --> 01:30:06,162
Save your dime. I'm going to bed.

863
01:30:06,789 --> 01:30:09,410
I already know how it's gonna turn out.

864
01:30:20,010 --> 01:30:22,217
We are gonna make it, ain't we?

865
01:30:26,518 --> 01:30:28,557
Yeah.

866
01:30:31,147 --> 01:30:33,186
We're gonna make it.

867
01:30:33,274 --> 01:30:36,441
If we only could.
We will.

868
01:30:37,195 --> 01:30:39,402
Maybe we still can.

869
01:31:15,901 --> 01:31:17,977
Jamaica.

870
01:31:18,070 --> 01:31:20,941
- Jamaica?
- That's where we're going.

871
01:31:22,199 --> 01:31:25,569
I don't even have my bathing suit.
But that's OK.

872
01:31:37,173 --> 01:31:40,708
We're gonna find us
a place high in the mountains,

873
01:31:40,802 --> 01:31:42,925
near a stream of water.

874
01:31:44,347 --> 01:31:46,470
Maybe a lake.

875
01:31:49,978 --> 01:31:52,220
Then I'm gonna cut my own logs

876
01:31:53,857 --> 01:31:57,107
and build us a little hut
with my own two hands.

877
01:31:58,528 --> 01:32:00,984
We'll have a cow,

878
01:32:01,073 --> 01:32:05,201
a couple of pigs, and some wild turkeys.

879
01:32:06,119 --> 01:32:09,535
- Baby turtles? I've always wanted a pet turtle.
- Mm?

880
01:32:11,875 --> 01:32:14,414
- I'll grow carrots in my garden for them.
- What?

881
01:32:14,503 --> 01:32:16,543
Carrots in my garden for them.

882
01:32:19,842 --> 01:32:22,297
All right, Harris, this is the police!

883
01:32:22,386 --> 01:32:25,969
Come out with your hands up
and there won't be any trouble.

884
01:32:38,236 --> 01:32:40,774
I'm gonna give you three seconds!

885
01:32:43,824 --> 01:32:45,947
Harris, you got three seconds!

886
01:32:47,161 --> 01:32:48,869
One...

887
01:32:50,081 --> 01:32:51,706
two...

888
01:32:52,625 --> 01:32:54,333
three!

889
01:32:59,549 --> 01:33:01,506
Aah!

890
01:33:05,722 --> 01:33:08,011
Aah!

891
01:33:17,150 --> 01:33:19,772
Start the car! Start the car!

892
01:33:48,223 --> 01:33:50,263
Aah!

893
01:38:10,867 --> 01:38:13,239
Keep your cover and hold your fire.

894
01:39:17,518 --> 01:39:20,056
Mattelli, get down.

895
01:39:21,272 --> 01:39:23,312
Get down.
