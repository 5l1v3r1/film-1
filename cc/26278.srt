2
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:21,079
It's okay.. We will get help soon.
We are coming to the main road.

3
00:00:24,580 --> 00:00:26,930
Try to hold on.
The burn, we'll get it fixed.

4
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:31,768
Watch it, Chris! Chris!

5
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:34,053
You'll kill us!

6
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:40,315
Chris!.. Chris!

7
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:43,174
What the devil you playing at?

8
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:45,089
Are you trying to commit suicide
or something?

9
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:46,790
If there is, I couldn't overcome it.

10
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,630
Is he all right? -
Oh probably just stunned.

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
What happened to his face?

12
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:52,620
That's what made him
delirious.  He was burnt.

13
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:54,060
When did this happen?

14
00:00:54,073 --> 00:00:55,893
About an hour ago.  We've
been driving ever since.

15
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:59,118
Better have it looked at.
I have never seen a burn like that.

16
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:00,452
What should I do for the doctor?

17
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,100
Are these what burned him?

18
00:01:02,150 --> 00:01:04,281
Yes.  We were on our way to
Willingdon Flats for a picnic.

19
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:07,374
There used to be a little village there
last year, but the government must
have pulled it down or something.

20
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:10,472
We stopped to turn round and
we heard a noise like falling
and Chris noticed..

21
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:11,500
Falling?

22
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:14,775
And when I found
him, he was like this.

23
00:01:14,860 --> 00:01:17,348
These're nothing but pieces of stone.
They couldn't burn anybody.

24
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:18,720
They burnt him, mister.

25
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:20,900
Chris, darling.

26
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:22,294
Let's get this back on the road.

27
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:24,133
Take the wheel, will ya?

28
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:25,993
Come on, push.

29
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:31,575
Chris!

30
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,100
Probably suffering from shock.

31
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:43,700
That's how he was in the car.

32
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:45,100
Better get you two into my car.

33
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,020
No, I can manage.  Just take
him and have a look at the ca...

34
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:06,572
There's scores of them coming down.
What are they?  Meteorites?

35
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:10,270
Meteorites give a strong trace as
soon as they strike the atmoshere.

36
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,720
These are different

37
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:12,900
Well what are they?

38
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:16,920
Whatever they are, they are
coming in low and slow.

39
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:18,500
You still holding yours?

40
00:03:18,652 --> 00:03:19,252
uh huh.

41
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,200
Soon as one lot fades
there're more.

42
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,800
Traces are getting fainter.
Yours too?

43
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:25,720
Yes, mine have gone.

44
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:29,920
What do you make of it?

45
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:33,720
A sudden fade out.
Two possibilities.

46
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:35,269
One, the scanner up there.

47
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,400
You think that's likely?

48
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:39,500
We've modified it and reset it
so much in the last few days
that it's probably a bit liverish.

49
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:41,800
Spots before the
eyes, so to speak.

50
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:43,200
And the other?

51
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:47,300
If those things were real, we lost them
because they reached the ground.

52
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
How far do you make it?

53
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:55,620
90 to a 100 miles north of here.
Somewhere in that area, land or sea.

54
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:59,100
It's pretty rough country there.
Over moorland, marsh.

55
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:03,000
We'll reset the scanner two degrees lower
and then make a complete circuit.
...Check.

56
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:38,277
What's going on here?
...Oh, hello Quatermass.

57
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:40,800
Who reset that scanner?
What's it doing at that low level?

58
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:42,100
Well, were making some tests sir.

59
00:04:42,105 --> 00:04:46,005
Gentleman the observatory like everything
else on this base was built for one test only.

60
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,873
I'll not see it used for any other purpose.

61
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:49,180
We happened to pick up some
rather curious echoes...

62
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:55,518
I'm not interested in echo's Brand, neither am I
interested in a skilled man like Marsh spending
half the night on one year pet projects.

63
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:57,690
That's quite unfair.
I wanted to stay Sir.

64
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:00,200
You had no right to.  In the
morning you may be half awake.

65
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,900
Have I ever let you down
on the job before?

66
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:05,790
Tomorrow, you may not have a job.
In fact none of us may have a job.

67
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:09,620
.. You want to do something useful,
have these stones classified and entered.

68
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:11,472
They may be meteorites.

69
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:12,180
Yes sir.

70
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:14,630
I take it you had a
difficult day in London.

71
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:18,014
I'm sorry.  I had no right
to jump on you like that.

72
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,352
What happened at
the administrate?

73
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,988
Moon Project, may it rest in peace.

74
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,078
Why?

75
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:27,855
They are giving us no more money.

76
00:05:28,543 --> 00:05:30,843
No more money, but
didn't you explain?

77
00:05:31,845 --> 00:05:35,458
Try and justify this to a commitee
of white hall bureaucrats.

78
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:41,600
Steel domes, where men can live in
artificial atmosphere.  Beings, alive on
a totally dead world.

79
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:48,217
50 rockets to take the components
up there, solar mirrors, producer units,
pressure domes.

80
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,678
I hate that I didn't go that far Brand.

81
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:54,300
They just stuck the current cost.
You know what they said?

82
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:59,172
To date you spent a lot of money
on a rocket that isn't even safe to launch.

83
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:03,095
At the moment we have projects
of far more importance.

84
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:04,749
Importance.

85
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:11,900
Brand, isn't it important enough to be
the first to build a colony on the moon
and get men there, against all odds? ...

86
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:19,235
These are for tomorrow, I am going
back to school again in the morning.

87
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:20,400
school?

88
00:06:20,450 --> 00:06:26,350
That's what they told me Brand.
Go Back and study atomic theory
again.  Find out where I went wrong.

89
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:27,894
Without spending money.

90
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,100
What did you say?

91
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:32,820
I felt like saying find yourself
another director for your
rocket group, I quit.

92
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:35,740
If I had any pride, that is exactly
what I would have done.

93
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:39,669
They must know we will get it right.  We only
need a few months to design and assemble
a new reactor, order a new coolent..

94
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:42,414
Have Hersh get this off first thing.
Tell them I am coming over.

95
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:43,752
The atomic centre?

96
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:49,100
Yes.. Telling the Gentlemen of Harwell
I am coming back to school..tomorrow.

97
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:50,110
This is ludicrous.

98
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:56,673
Nevertheless I'm willing to do it.
..I'll play the game their way..for the
time being.  Anything to keep this together.

99
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:05,879
Can you still bear to look at it?

100
00:07:06,210 --> 00:07:10,910
The sum total of our achievement up
to now, one rocket, crewless, untried.

101
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Because we dare'nt try.

102
00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:13,050
Were not sure of that, Brand

103
00:07:13,052 --> 00:07:15,052
Not sure of that! That nuclear motor is as faulty as...

104
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:16,160
Were not sure of that.

105
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:18,760
Listen Quatermass.  Give them
that story, but don't try on me.

106
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:21,600
We know that as soon as that thing left the
earth, we would be stoking up an atomic bomb.

107
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:24,440
We could send it up without
a crew by remote control.

108
00:07:24,450 --> 00:07:26,450
If you did you'd never
dare bring it back to earth.

109
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:31,200
I intend to correct that fault. I'm going
to send it up there and bring it back,
not once but a hundred times.

110
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:35,100
You better go and get some sleep...
I'm going down to the rocket base.

111
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:07,900
Yes?..Right..Yes immediately.

112
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:12,580
Joan, 'cross to the canteen and get
some coffee.  Mr. Quatermass is coming
up from the launching bay form.

113
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:15,618
Better make it three though,
they'll all want some.  I'll finish this.

114
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:16,740
The old man checked in yet?

115
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:17,600
checked in?

116
00:08:17,650 --> 00:08:20,050
Can't be. He has been at
the launching base all night.

117
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:22,151
I want to see him urgently
the moment he gets back.

118
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:24,379
Oh sir, could you come
along to the observatory?

119
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,100
Did you get through to Harwell?

120
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:27,436
Yes. 12:30 alright?

121
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:28,700
I'd like some coffee.

122
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:29,550
It's on its way.

123
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,800
Ah sir, about that meteorite.

124
00:08:31,521 --> 00:08:32,521
What about it?

125
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,300
Well, I found out it's got
a definite shape sir.

126
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:35,829
Where did you get this Quatermass?

127
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:39,000
It's supposed to fallen about
90 miles away from here.  Why?

128
00:08:39,050 --> 00:08:41,550
New one on me sir.  We don't have
this substance classified at all.

129
00:08:41,650 --> 00:08:43,825
Further more it's
symmetric, and hollow.

130
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:45,372
Probably some pieces missing.

131
00:08:45,450 --> 00:08:47,450
No sir. Inside's symmetric too.

132
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:48,400
When did this fall?

133
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:52,900
Last night.  I had a motor accident.
A couple of kids, they said they picked it up.

134
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Those traces we had on the screen last night.

135
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:57,178
That's right, they were about ninety miles away.

136
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:58,800
You plotted them?

137
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:00,300
They didn't give the same signal,
those meteorites.

138
00:09:00,305 --> 00:09:02,405
It's only an estimate sir,
but that's the rough area.

139
00:09:02,450 --> 00:09:05,270
They came in low and slow and
then we lost them.  Probably
because they hit the ground.

140
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,440
Willingdon Flats!

141
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:08,090
What's that?

142
00:09:08,150 --> 00:09:09,650
The girl said Willingdon Flats.

143
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:10,900
What girl?

144
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Marsh. Get the car.

145
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:13,200
Well, don't you think you ought to get
some sleep?..

146
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:14,100
Get the Car.

147
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:15,880
I don't want to seem dead sir but
I don't understand.

148
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:19,400
I don't understand either, Brand, that's
why I want to have a look at Willingdon Flats.

149
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:24,420
I want you to make me a reconstruction
of the shape of this thing before it hit
the atmosphere of the earth.

150
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:26,600
Yes sir.

151
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:36,080
'You can't find it on the map,
look in the AA book.

152
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:37,900
No, here it is- Willingdon Flats

153
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,920
Okay, give me the road number.

154
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:42,020
Well you take the Carlisle road...

155
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,440
It shouldn't be more than
four or five miles now.

156
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,900
Do we stay on this road?

157
00:10:13,013 --> 00:10:14,613
yeah, I'm afraid so. It's all
there is.

158
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:17,400
Hey!.. What's that?

159
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:19,189
New road.

160
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:21,340
It's not shown on the map.
Should we take it?

161
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:22,552
We've no choice.

162
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:23,719
Government property sign.

163
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:25,879
Maybe we struck a rival project.

164
00:10:34,810 --> 00:10:38,210
There has been a lot of traffic here.
Heavy stuff by the tire marks.

165
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:40,000
Probably construction trucks.

166
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:42,930
There's another road.
No more road blocks.

167
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:55,600
Well that's funny!..We have a
road leading to nowhere..

168
00:10:55,650 --> 00:10:57,150
Hey, wait a minute, don't
walk on that stuff.

169
00:10:57,175 --> 00:10:57,675
What?

170
00:10:57,700 --> 00:11:02,000
-It might be mined, anything...
We'll go back and try the right fork.
You Game?

171
00:11:02,010 --> 00:11:02,910
Sure.

172
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:06,174
DANGER

173
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:09,299
PROHIBITED

174
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:39,189
What happened sir?  Is anything?...

175
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:40,915
Oh, no!

176
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:46,600
The Moon project!

177
00:11:46,950 --> 00:11:48,770
It's unbelievable.

178
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,672
Were wrong.  We must be.

179
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:51,700
But there's still...

180
00:11:51,725 --> 00:11:53,925
Coincidence of shapes.
Must be an explanation.

181
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:56,420
But in so many details.

182
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,472
What's all this debris?

183
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:05,200
Do you think? You think this could be the
village that disappeared?

184
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:09,100
Willingdon Flats.. Whatever it was it has
been fairly well flattened.

185
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:14,800
Hey look. Look on the ground.
Look everywhere.  There all around us.

186
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:18,960
Pieces of meteorite.
And there the same.

187
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:21,538
They are exactly the same
as the one we've got.

188
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:25,020
Some these must have been here
for months, they're crumbling.

189
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:26,400
Well this one's quite recently broken.

190
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:31,172
I wonder if that's meant for us?

191
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:33,013
Perhaps we better go
and explain ourselves.

192
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:35,094
Hey look at this sir!  Look at this!

193
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:39,200
I think this. I think this
is a whole one. Yes it is.

194
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:43,174
It's exactly the same odd shape as
the other.  It isn't even cracked.  It's....

195
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:44,020
What is it?

196
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:47,196
That's funny.  I thought I felt a sort of..

197
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:48,640
Put it down.

198
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:50,020
A sort of vibration.

199
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,668
Marsh, Your face. There's
something on your face.

200
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,115
Are you alright? Let me take a look.

201
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:03,171
You know for a moment, I could have sworn
I saw something like a big black bubble.

202
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,315
Marsh!

203
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:24,000
You got a lung full of
gas.  Try and stand up.

204
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:25,812
Here, Lean on me.

205
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:57,940
This man is sick.  If you just help
me get him back to the car.

206
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:01,800
He's in urgent need of medical attention.

207
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:04,200
He was examining something right there.

208
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:08,631
You know what these things
are?  What they do to?...

209
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:19,808
Who are you?

210
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:27,940
And what's this?  What is this place?
Where are you taking him?   Wait a minute!
I got to go with him.  I got to explain.

211
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:57,797
Go!  Go now.

212
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,315
Excuse me.

213
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
 Where can I find the police?

214
00:15:40,167 --> 00:15:42,167
Police!  Have you been
in accident or something?

215
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:44,400
Please. This is urgent. Where is
the nearest police station?

216
00:15:44,463 --> 00:15:46,583
It's at Frawly, about
15 miles further on.

217
00:15:46,719 --> 00:15:49,219
15 miles. You mean there
aren't any police here?

218
00:15:49,222 --> 00:15:51,422
Only the camp commitee.  They
do everything around here.

219
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:52,620
Where can I find Them?

220
00:15:52,689 --> 00:15:55,189
Community centre.  First on the left,
and then it's on the right.

221
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:58,039
 Thank you.

222
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:11,149
Signed, etc. etc.

223
00:16:11,150 --> 00:16:12,370
Tea and sandwiches.

224
00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:13,660
Yes,  please.

225
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:15,020
Is this the camp commitee?

226
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:16,390
I'm the secretary.  Could I help you?

227
00:16:16,418 --> 00:16:17,818
They tell me you have no police here.

228
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:21,694
The Police!  What do you know - We don't
need them.  We are law abiding community.
Oh goodness me...

229
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:22,700
That's right Mr. Dorg

230
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:24,000
We handle any little problem.

231
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:27,100
All right then tell me, what's
that place just over the hill?

232
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:29,200
Over the hill?

233
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:32,850
That mill, that factory, plant, whatever
it is.  Just about five miles from here.

234
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:36,000
With the big steel domes.
What do they make there?
What's its pupose?

235
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:38,913
They're lot of questions you're asking.

236
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,289
They're perfectly simple questions.

237
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:41,800
Are they?

238
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:49,100
Our people are working on this project
mister.  Their construction workers build
it and getting good money.

239
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:51,940
In return we ought to keep our
mouths shut, same as in war time see.

240
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,900
Now listen.  I just drove near that place..

241
00:16:53,950 --> 00:16:54,750
Why? didn't you see...

242
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:58,860
My companion was suddenly affected
..b.. Well, he was taken ill.

243
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:02,400
Before I could get him out of there, the guards
from that plant came and arrested him.

244
00:17:02,450 --> 00:17:05,323
Guards?  Goodness to have
trouble with the guards?

245
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,797
One took a swipe at me with his rifle.

246
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:08,600
Well then, you shouldn't have been there.

247
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:12,076
Hey listen, my friend's life may be
in danger.  He may need skilled help.

248
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:13,214
He'll get that in the plant.

249
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:14,753
Well, they have got eveything there.

250
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:16,300
Let's make sure.

251
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:19,549
Get me the police station at Frawly

252
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:21,000
No.  That won't do no good.

253
00:17:21,050 --> 00:17:22,050
We'll find out.

254
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:25,309
Go and talk to them if you
like, but not from here.

255
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:26,400
Police can't do anything.

256
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:28,100
She's right.  They wouldn't touch it.

257
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:30,580
Is that so?

258
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:36,500
The guards.

259
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:38,620
shouldn't have gone.

260
00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:45,095
Hello?  No sorry.  It was a mistake.

261
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:55,860
Good evening.  This an unfortunate business.

262
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:57,515
The sargent told you what happened.

263
00:17:57,550 --> 00:18:00,010
He did.  Your friend was
arrested by security guards.

264
00:18:00,171 --> 00:18:02,791
If he was tresspassing, I'm afraid
they were within their rights.

265
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,556
Am I to understand that you
refuse to do anything about this?

266
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:08,600
I don't know what you
mean by flatly refuse, sir.

267
00:18:08,550 --> 00:18:12,950
As I see it you ran into an experimental
project you don't understand, in a place
you've no right to be.

268
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:13,800
What is that place?

269
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:17,300
I have no idea either sir, except
that it is top secret and we have
strict orders about it.

270
00:18:17,350 --> 00:18:18,350
From Whom?

271
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:19,400
From White Hall

272
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:22,020
And you telling me, nothing is to
be done about what happened.

273
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:25,200
Well, what do you want me to do sir?
Now you're bringing charges as a result?

274
00:18:25,205 --> 00:18:26,525
yes,  If that will get some action.

275
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:30,190
Very well then.  I will fill in the report
for the chief constable.  We'll deal
him to put it through London.

276
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:32,436
Forget it.  I'll shortcut back!

277
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:47,853
Oh Mr. Quatermass, Harwell called to know..

278
00:18:47,855 --> 00:18:48,655
Where's Dr. Brand?

279
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:51,500
In the observatory.  But there are several
new QI , I think you will want to look at.

280
00:18:51,501 --> 00:18:52,501
Tomorrow!

281
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:55,800
 Brand!

282
00:18:55,850 --> 00:19:00,750
There's been more traces about
an hour ago. .. A few are faint
but in the same direction.

283
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:04,270
I want you to organize all the
help you need.  Picture 24 hour guard.

284
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:05,700
What happened?

285
00:19:05,725 --> 00:19:06,725
Do it now!

286
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:10,691
Kelly, get Michaels and Peterson.
Get them over here right away.

287
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:11,730
I think they'll have gone by now.

288
00:19:11,731 --> 00:19:12,851
Strictest orders.  This is urgent.

289
00:19:17,450 --> 00:19:21,950
We found the place where the things
have been falling.  The whole area is
littered with fragments of them.

290
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:25,100
They look like meteorite,
but they're not.

291
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:26,400
So what are they?

292
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:28,900
They're some form of container.

293
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:33,095
Marsh found a whole one.  When he
picked it up, it burst in his face.

294
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:34,400
What was inside?

295
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:39,150
Ammonia gas, and something else.

296
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:41,379
Something alive.

297
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:45,375
Just for a second,  I saw it
on his face.  Then it was gone.

298
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:49,700
But the mark was there, and then
the guards came and took him away.

299
00:19:49,705 --> 00:19:50,924
Guards.  What guards?

300
00:19:50,950 --> 00:19:52,474
I'm sorry.  I guess I'm not...

301
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:53,700
Where is this place?

302
00:19:55,476 --> 00:19:59,996
It was Willingdon Flats.. and there's
something else there Brand.

303
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:05,055
The moon project.

304
00:20:05,352 --> 00:20:06,472
The moon project.  Now wait a minute..

305
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:09,880
It was there at Willingdon Flats.
The moon project and all its essentials..

306
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:16,000
A colony of steel pressure domes,
hundreds of feet high.  I saw it.
.. Marsh saw it.

307
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:17,400
Where is Marsh?

308
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:21,649
He's.. in that place.  The
guards took him there.

309
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:26,200
And that mark.  It was
on there faces too.

310
00:20:26,205 --> 00:20:27,005
What did you do?

311
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:28,300
I went to the police.

312
00:20:28,405 --> 00:20:29,105
And?

313
00:20:29,110 --> 00:20:30,510
Brand, the police won't act.

314
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:31,700
You told them all about this?

315
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:34,250
I told them all they were
capable of believing.

316
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:38,300
Tomorrow I will go to London,
take it to the top level.

317
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:42,000
You'll probably find some simple explanation
we haven't even thought of.

318
00:20:42,230 --> 00:20:49,330
I hope that's it.. I hope it is because
if it isn't I think we are on the verge
of something so, so ugly.

319
00:20:49,818 --> 00:20:50,818
Yes, what is it?

320
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Mr. Peterson and Mr. Michaels
are coming right over.

321
00:20:53,050 --> 00:20:54,050
Oh thanks Kelly.

322
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:55,400
Do you want me to stay too?

323
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:59,538
No. Thanks. Just organize some
more coffee before you leave.

324
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:01,100
Of course.

325
00:21:03,310 --> 00:21:07,910
It isn't credible.  Brand, it just isn't credible.

326
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:12,134
Better handle it gently till
the plaster hardens sir.

327
00:21:14,350 --> 00:21:15,523
How much of this is guess work?

328
00:21:15,650 --> 00:21:18,806
Hardly any sir.  It's worked
out for mineral stresses.

329
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:21,300
Brand.

330
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:22,400
Coming

331
00:21:23,702 --> 00:21:28,102
I want a half dozen more of these
models for wind tunnel tests.  Have
them made in the shop as soon as you can.

332
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,279
Yes sir.

333
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:30,700
original shape.

334
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:32,400
They're areodynamic.

335
00:21:32,450 --> 00:21:35,881
If an object like that were to approach
the earth's atmosphere at the correct angle..

336
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:42,654
It might lose speed in braking elipses
an land relatively slowly.. same principal
as rocket descent.

337
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:44,660
It implies a great deal.

338
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:50,400
Knowledge.. mathematics,
precise planning.. intelligence.

339
00:21:50,830 --> 00:21:52,383
Dr. Brand!

340
00:21:56,150 --> 00:21:57,829
There are more traces coming in.

341
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,100
Right.  I'm going to try something different.

342
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:05,200
We'll have to adjust the radio telescope
to a completely new setting for long range.

343
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:06,800
That means resetting half the circuits.

344
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,520
I'll work on that now.

345
00:23:00,425 --> 00:23:02,263
All right.  Come and take Raffles away.

346
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:04,950
Well sir, this is an unexpected pleasure.

347
00:23:04,955 --> 00:23:05,655
Lomax.

348
00:23:05,753 --> 00:23:06,453
Is it found sir?

349
00:23:06,455 --> 00:23:09,275
No, not yet Harry.  So there
is still time for good behaviour.

350
00:23:09,410 --> 00:23:12,407
All right sargent, let him ruminate
a bit longer.  Off you go Harry.

351
00:23:11,950 --> 00:23:14,750
I could sue the police
for wrongful arrest.

352
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:16,000
Very good idea...

353
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:20,052
Sorry sir, a bit of my homework.
Well it has been a while since we met.

354
00:23:20,070 --> 00:23:23,770
Last time you brought me more trouble
than I have known before or since.

355
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:24,500
Inspector!

356
00:23:24,505 --> 00:23:25,924
Sit down sir. Make yourself comfortable.
Have a cigarette.

357
00:23:25,950 --> 00:23:26,650
No thank you.

358
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:28,260
Funny.  I was only saying
to the wife the other day...

359
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:36,100
Inspector!  Just how much do you know
about a place called Willingdon Flats?
What's going on there?  What's it's purpose?

360
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,715
I thought better of you,
spoiling a beautiful friendship.

361
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:40,654
What do you mean?

362
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:43,700
You must know as well as I do
that Willingdon Flats is top secret.

363
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:47,920
Secret!  You put a lable like that on anything
and law and order go out the window, is that it?

364
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:51,258
Now look here sir It's your little habit to ride
rough shod over everything and...

365
00:23:51,259 --> 00:23:54,690
These are pieces of an object found
near Willingdon Flats.

366
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:06,500
When the stone broke up, suppose
a bit of it hit Marsh.  The mark on his
face might have been a cut.

367
00:24:06,505 --> 00:24:07,305
It wasn't.

368
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:11,488
Alright, but.. That place should
be harmless enough.

369
00:24:11,510 --> 00:24:13,061
Then you do know what it is.

370
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:15,700
Yes sir?

371
00:24:15,705 --> 00:24:18,305
Green Park 4394, Mr. Vincent Broadhead.

372
00:24:18,550 --> 00:24:19,350
Who's he?

373
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:26,100
I only know him slightly.  Member of parliament.
He's been trying to force public enquiry about
Willingdon Flats.  Maybe you should talk to him.

374
00:24:26,101 --> 00:24:28,253
Will he tell me what the place is?

375
00:24:28,750 --> 00:24:31,528
It's a government project
to make synthetic food.

376
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:35,357
Synthetic Food?  With guards and guns.

377
00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:36,940
They must think it's worth guarding.

378
00:24:40,690 --> 00:24:41,390
Hello?

379
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:44,853
Mr. Broadhead,
Inspector Lomax sir.

380
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:52,900
I have someone here who you might like to meet.
He has some rather curious information about..a
certain establishment.  Are you dependable sir?

381
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:54,100
What?

382
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:57,333
Quite dependable.  In an hour
at the house of commons.

383
00:24:57,860 --> 00:24:58,560
yep.

384
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:00,149
Yes, he'll be there.

385
00:25:00,290 --> 00:25:02,128
Quatermass.  That's right.

386
00:25:02,170 --> 00:25:03,485
Not at all sir.

387
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:06,668
You realize of course that if anyone
else had told me this yarn..

388
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:09,274
Broadhead, Broadhead.
Thank you inspector.

389
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:22,915
All I ask Mr. Broadhead is to break
through this wall of secrecy.

390
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:26,875
Me too, Mr Quatermass, but let me tell you
this.  There is a reason for this secrecy.

391
00:25:27,310 --> 00:25:32,310
Willingdon Flats is a blunder.  The biggest blunder that's
been with public money and they're trying to cover it up.

392
00:25:32,350 --> 00:25:35,860
Even to the extent of armed
guards arresting sick men?

393
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,953
Ah, that's a good point.  I
will try and deal with that.

394
00:25:39,247 --> 00:25:42,667
Do we know it's synthetic food?  Do we
know what they are doing down there?

395
00:25:42,690 --> 00:25:45,090
We don't know anything.  That's
what I'm belly aching about.

396
00:25:45,150 --> 00:25:49,607
Oh yes, for years we've known a group of scientists
has been working down at Willingdon Flats.

397
00:25:49,650 --> 00:25:52,344
But that was just a couple of tin huts
and a pinhole in the budget.

398
00:25:52,390 --> 00:25:56,123
But suddenly bingo, they've got it, and
asking for millions and getting them too.

399
00:25:56,150 --> 00:25:57,547
When did all this start?

400
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:01,810
About two years ago.  Now there is a mad
rush to get a production plant built.

401
00:26:01,820 --> 00:26:06,649
Tremendous insane costs.  And now I gather they're
ready to go into production to beat the world.

402
00:26:07,310 --> 00:26:13,110
But they got to prove that to Vinny Broadhead.
Because I'll turn out that there's something wrong
Quatermass.  Something very wrong.

403
00:26:13,620 --> 00:26:14,320
What?

404
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:24,291
Take a look out at the Thames.  What you see?
Boats, barges, tugs.  All that's missing.

405
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:31,747
There's no distribution centre set up forthis
synthetic food.  None.  No sales organization.
Nothing at all.  Well that's what I've found out.

406
00:26:32,070 --> 00:26:37,704
Mr. Broadhead,  Whether you believe all
the things I've told you or not you have
just got help me get into that place.

407
00:26:38,210 --> 00:26:43,559
Help You?  For months I've been trying help myself.
The pass has only just coming through this morning.

408
00:26:44,370 --> 00:26:45,930
The ministry chap should be here by now.

409
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,550
You're going inside the plant?

410
00:26:47,770 --> 00:26:53,470
Yes, this afternoon.. And don't think
they won't be sorry to let me.  They may
fool the others but not Vinny Broadhead.

411
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:54,320
There have been others?

412
00:26:54,330 --> 00:26:56,041
Oh yes.  Parties going down to inspect it.

413
00:26:56,050 --> 00:26:57,326
Were they people you knew?

414
00:26:57,350 --> 00:27:01,970
Aye, some of them.  Your thinking something
happened to them.  No lad, they turned up again.

415
00:27:02,110 --> 00:27:03,224
Did they say what they had seen?

416
00:27:03,250 --> 00:27:04,550
No, they wouldn't talk about it.

417
00:27:04,850 --> 00:27:05,963
Isn't that strange in itself?

418
00:27:06,027 --> 00:27:09,027
No, no, no!  They had the
wool pulled over their eyes.

419
00:27:09,050 --> 00:27:13,750
Decided to be loyal.. tow the
party line.. support the project.
Huh, just let me get at it.

420
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:15,215
Mr. Broadhead!

421
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:16,531
Are you Mr. Broadhead?

422
00:27:16,590 --> 00:27:18,990
Ah, that's right.  Oh, are you
the chap with my pass?

423
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,300
For the inspection decided this afternoon.

424
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:24,352
Fine, it only took three months!
Oh, I was wondering whether
I might bring somebody along.

425
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:26,516
'Yes that's right.  This gentleman here.

426
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:27,700
Name?

427
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:29,800
Quatermass.

428
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:31,528
Yes, I think that'll be in order

429
00:27:32,070 --> 00:27:33,385
Just a minute please.

430
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:36,314
Well, It looks as though I should have
brought you along 3 months ago.

431
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:39,278
The inspection party will assemble for
transport at 2 pm in parliament square.

432
00:27:39,310 --> 00:27:41,359
Fine. It just gives us
time for a bite of lunch.

433
00:27:41,410 --> 00:27:42,968
It doesn't always take three months..

434
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,100
Are you coming Quatermass?

435
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:45,500
Yes.  Thank you.

436
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:47,900
You have just over an hour.

437
00:27:48,910 --> 00:27:52,227
And do please try to be punctual.
We've very tight schedule ahead of us.

438
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:12,900
That's right.

439
00:28:16,270 --> 00:28:17,270
Thank you.

440
00:28:44,750 --> 00:28:47,384
These your guards?  They look harmless enough.

441
00:28:52,110 --> 00:28:53,243
Your passes, please.

442
00:28:57,430 --> 00:28:58,430
Thank you.

443
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:01,818
Nothing very sinister so far.

444
00:30:13,330 --> 00:30:15,680
Certainly nothing abnormal about them.

445
00:30:20,630 --> 00:30:23,025
MEDICAL CENTER

446
00:30:23,130 --> 00:30:25,560
I'm going to take a look in there.
Do you want to come?

447
00:30:30,430 --> 00:30:32,262
Just a minute.  Have you
seen the other two men?

448
00:30:32,300 --> 00:30:34,218
The last time I saw them
they were back there.

449
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:37,420
Now you wait here,
I'll find them.

450
00:30:45,290 --> 00:30:46,429
What do you want, please?

451
00:30:46,430 --> 00:30:47,739
Oh, we're in the inspection party.

452
00:30:47,950 --> 00:30:49,267
You have no business here .

453
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:51,700
It's official, they...oh they took our passes.

454
00:30:51,705 --> 00:30:53,805
Have you any patients here?

455
00:30:54,413 --> 00:30:55,533
There is no one.

456
00:30:55,550 --> 00:30:57,750
We thought a young man was brought
in here yesterday by the guards.

457
00:30:57,751 --> 00:30:58,871
I think I'll take a look.

458
00:31:09,190 --> 00:31:10,190
Any sign?

459
00:31:10,352 --> 00:31:12,472
No, he was here.
He must have been.

460
00:31:12,750 --> 00:31:14,850
Yesterday afternoon.  His name was Marsh.

461
00:31:14,950 --> 00:31:15,650
No!

462
00:31:15,670 --> 00:31:17,062
What are all these beds for?

463
00:31:17,210 --> 00:31:18,410
You are evidently prepared for...

464
00:31:18,411 --> 00:31:24,711
Gentlemen!  Why have you left
the inspection party?  You mustn't
do that.  Come now, quickly!

465
00:31:24,712 --> 00:31:25,637
I just wanted to see..

466
00:31:25,638 --> 00:31:28,938
There's no one.. Come, please.

467
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:31,750
I still want to know..

468
00:31:31,751 --> 00:31:34,751
All questions will be answered later.
Now will you come with the others please?

469
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:38,756
Come on Quatermass, we want
to see the plant, don't we?

470
00:31:41,730 --> 00:31:45,081
You understand gentlemen, we must
keep strickly according to time.

471
00:31:45,330 --> 00:31:46,230
But the plant.

472
00:31:46,236 --> 00:31:48,056
You'll see it all.  Everything.

473
00:31:49,170 --> 00:31:52,270
Gentlemen,  I regret the delay.

474
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:53,800
'Our fault, we took a look around.

475
00:31:53,810 --> 00:31:57,160
It's alright.  I haven't wasted time, been
reading up synthetic food processes.

476
00:31:57,170 --> 00:31:58,646
Now please, we start this way.

477
00:31:58,650 --> 00:32:00,570
It's not been much help.
It's all completely distant.

478
00:32:00,580 --> 00:32:01,855
You'll been shown everything later.

479
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:03,490
What are those enormous domes?

480
00:32:03,495 --> 00:32:04,495
They're for storage.

481
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:05,920
What of, synthetic food?

482
00:32:05,940 --> 00:32:10,540
That is correct.  It.. um, matures in
those domes. But please, eveything
will be answered later.

483
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:13,275
Now, this way.  If you will go first.

484
00:32:21,030 --> 00:32:22,629
AMMONIA

485
00:32:27,790 --> 00:32:29,309
These pipes.  What runs through them?

486
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:31,200
The food.  Now lets proceed.

487
00:32:31,204 --> 00:32:32,304
The food?  you mean the raw product.

488
00:32:32,305 --> 00:32:33,305
The raw product.

489
00:32:33,310 --> 00:32:35,710
Then it's pumped through
these pipes to the domes.

490
00:32:35,750 --> 00:32:37,850
Everything will be answered later.

491
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:49,320
Look, that's an expection door isn't it?
So you can see the stuff going through.

492
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:51,700
I'd like to take a look at that.

493
00:32:51,738 --> 00:32:52,858
Later. You will see everything.

494
00:32:52,980 --> 00:32:54,970
Are we going to see
inside a big dome?

495
00:32:55,050 --> 00:32:57,150
That's where you are going
now.  Please continue.

496
00:33:11,350 --> 00:33:12,150
Mind you step.

497
00:33:16,270 --> 00:33:19,098
This way please...Right along will you.

498
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:20,500
Quickly.

499
00:33:22,490 --> 00:33:23,490
Keep moving.

500
00:33:26,590 --> 00:33:27,809
Oh dear, it's deep.

501
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:30,315
We're not inside the dome are we?

502
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:36,000
No.  This is an air lock.  It's not possible
to enter the dome itself but you will be
taken downstairs.

503
00:33:36,050 --> 00:33:37,250
What, down there?

504
00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:38,269
It's quite safe.

505
00:33:38,380 --> 00:33:40,438
Well, you will have to go first.
I have no head for heights.

506
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:42,858
What's going on down there?

507
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:44,200
It's part of the process.

508
00:33:44,278 --> 00:33:46,978
Now please don't wait here.
We must keep going.

509
00:33:49,650 --> 00:33:50,650
Where is the other man?

510
00:33:50,655 --> 00:33:51,755
The other man?

511
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:53,600
Broadhead.

512
00:33:53,613 --> 00:33:54,733
I didn't see him come in.

513
00:34:02,250 --> 00:34:04,459
Now please don't worry.  He'll be fine
and everything will be in order.

514
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:07,392
It all looks nice efficient.  What are
you doing, sending a search party?

515
00:34:11,395 --> 00:34:12,145
What's this?

516
00:34:12,250 --> 00:34:14,050
A safety precaution.

517
00:34:26,130 --> 00:34:27,330
Shall we go down?

518
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:29,100
I don't want to.

519
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,820
I'm afraid we must.

520
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:38,294
Broadhead!

521
00:34:43,190 --> 00:34:44,709
Broadhead!

522
00:34:49,290 --> 00:34:50,923
Broadhead!

523
00:34:52,450 --> 00:34:54,163
Broadhead!

524
00:35:40,110 --> 00:35:41,810
No,  No,  Don't touch me.

525
00:35:49,350 --> 00:35:50,150
- Broadhead

526
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:51,300
Don't touch me

527
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:52,800
What happened?

528
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:58,634
I..I had to find out.. had to find out.

529
00:35:58,600 --> 00:35:59,839
You were inside?

530
00:36:00,370 --> 00:36:02,162
I fell.

531
00:36:02,610 --> 00:36:03,310
Quatermass.

532
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:04,200
I'm here.

533
00:36:04,250 --> 00:36:05,550
Can't see you, Quatermass.

534
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:11,100
It burns.  This is the food
and it burns.

535
00:36:11,590 --> 00:36:12,779
You lie down,  I'll go get...

536
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:14,720
No...Don't touch me.

537
00:36:25,270 --> 00:36:26,585
Broadhead?

538
00:38:30,010 --> 00:38:31,940
Tonight's list of the mobile controls.

539
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:34,709
Any area calls put them through
to me will you?  Simpsons got the flue.

540
00:38:34,900 --> 00:38:35,900
Yes sir.

541
00:38:38,470 --> 00:38:40,785
yes?  Yes, I just got them.

542
00:38:41,470 --> 00:38:43,770
That's 26 in mobile.. that's right.

543
00:38:43,910 --> 00:38:46,410
He's here.. Inspector Baker.  Right.

544
00:38:46,450 --> 00:38:47,450
Hi 'general'.

545
00:38:47,493 --> 00:38:48,513
Good evening Mr. Hall.

546
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:50,037
Are there any good charge sheets lately?

547
00:38:50,270 --> 00:38:51,462
Nothing you'd want to print.

548
00:38:51,700 --> 00:38:55,120
Trade you a drink for anything that will
fill one and half columns before midnight.

549
00:38:55,150 --> 00:38:57,120
Well how about the report I
have for bribing the police?

550
00:38:57,121 --> 00:38:58,241
Yahhh.

551
00:38:58,410 --> 00:38:59,610
Who's the bossman tonight?

552
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:02,616
Come out, come out, whoever you are.

553
00:39:02,900 --> 00:39:04,334
Wow, if it isn't Jolly Baker.

554
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:05,500
Hello Jimmy.

555
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:06,800
It must be something.

556
00:39:06,805 --> 00:39:11,075
A little larcen..Mayham.  Just enough
skulduggery to fill one and half columns.

557
00:39:11,150 --> 00:39:12,747
How's feeling sick tonight, Jimmy?

558
00:39:12,870 --> 00:39:14,203
Tell me the story of your life.

559
00:39:14,220 --> 00:39:15,340
Yah.  That's what I get.

560
00:39:16,700 --> 00:39:17,525
Well,  Yes sir?

561
00:39:17,550 --> 00:39:18,850
Is chief inspector Lomax still here?

562
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:20,449
Listen, just fill in a form to find out.  For..

563
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:23,800
That won't be necessary.  If he's here he'll
see me.  My name is Quatermass.

564
00:39:23,970 --> 00:39:24,970
Quatermass?

565
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:26,391
Don't I know your name?

566
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:27,400
Possibly.

567
00:39:27,750 --> 00:39:32,150
Couldn't be the old pal.  You're not the criminal
type.  Jimmy Hall can tell them every time.

568
00:39:32,170 --> 00:39:33,170
Okay sir.

569
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:34,225
Adsil Lude will show you out sir.

570
00:39:34,230 --> 00:39:35,530
Thank you, I know the way.

571
00:39:40,130 --> 00:39:44,330
Quatermass.. Quatermass.
Why do I know that name?

572
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:48,100
Lomax.  I'm glad you're here.

573
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:49,792
But nearly not.  Just called the wife to say..

574
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:51,800
How much power have you got here?
How much real authority?

575
00:39:51,801 --> 00:39:52,601
I'm afraid I don't..

576
00:39:52,602 --> 00:39:55,502
Could you call an emergency action
on a large scale it would have to be?

577
00:39:55,504 --> 00:39:56,204
Action for What?

578
00:39:56,205 --> 00:40:01,705
An action, that if I told you that is what is
really being carried out in Willingdon Flats
 is mass destruction of men's minds.

579
00:40:01,710 --> 00:40:03,821
Now look sir, I'm a pretty ordinary sort
of fellow with a pretty ordinary sort of ..

580
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:08,398
Listen, Broadhead took me down there this
afternoon with an official inspection party.

581
00:40:08,470 --> 00:40:11,900
The place is almost exactly what I told
you it was.  I got out of there alone.

582
00:40:11,905 --> 00:40:15,035
The rest of them got trapped into staying.
I was meant to be one of them.

583
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:16,559
Are you suggesting
they've been murdered?

584
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:21,690
I'm suggesting that they have  been
methodically infected with the same
thing that struck young Marsh yesterday.

585
00:40:21,950 --> 00:40:23,062
You mean that mark?

586
00:40:23,210 --> 00:40:29,710
Maybe the mark.  I don't know yet, but I do
know they will come back, like hundreds, maybe
thousands of others have come infected.

587
00:40:30,230 --> 00:40:35,900
If I had stayed there I might be here
talking to you now but not saying the
things I'm saying.  I wouldn't be able to.

588
00:40:39,590 --> 00:40:40,980
Does Vincent Broadhead think this?

589
00:40:41,230 --> 00:40:43,049
Vincent Broadhead is dead!

590
00:40:43,050 --> 00:40:43,650
Dead!

591
00:40:43,655 --> 00:40:50,345
I watched him die a few hours ago in that
plant. His whole body covered with some
kind of corrosive poisoning, eaten away.

592
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:54,415
Some of the flack slime got on my
coat.  I had to cut out the spot.

593
00:40:56,900 --> 00:40:58,000
Don't touch it!

594
00:40:59,230 --> 00:41:01,182
And how does that story
measure up with this one?

595
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:06,700
VINCENT BROADHEAD
TRAVELS IN TRADE MISSION

596
00:41:06,901 --> 00:41:11,473
This is a lie.  Vincent Broadhead was with
me this afternoon at Willingdon Flats.
Where did this story come from?

597
00:41:11,670 --> 00:41:13,783
It says it's an official
government announcement.

598
00:41:14,700 --> 00:41:16,000
The minute they new he was dead.

599
00:41:16,050 --> 00:41:17,350
Are you seriously trying..

600
00:41:17,351 --> 00:41:24,351
Broadhead was with me and the others at Willingdon Flats
and he was killed by a corresive compound of ammonia
which is what they're manufacturing in that plant.

601
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:27,730
Quatermass, do you realize what you're
alleging?  That in a goverment sponsored...

602
00:41:27,735 --> 00:41:30,135
The point is I am still here to allege it.

603
00:41:30,750 --> 00:41:33,450
Take a squad of men into that plant.
You'll get your proof soon enough.

604
00:41:33,460 --> 00:41:34,780
You know I can't do that.

605
00:41:34,810 --> 00:41:37,910
Then get your pathologist to
analyze that and confirm it.

606
00:41:38,310 --> 00:41:39,783
You got to start an investigation.

607
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:41,139
What, on your statements alone?

608
00:41:41,150 --> 00:41:45,470
You got to.  Talk to the
commissioner or let me talk
to him.  Lomax, you've got to act.

609
00:41:49,030 --> 00:41:49,630
Yes sir?

610
00:41:49,700 --> 00:41:50,800
Has the commissioner gone?

611
00:41:50,820 --> 00:41:52,220
Not yet sir.

612
00:41:53,110 --> 00:41:56,388
This better be true. That's all I
have to say.  It better be true.

613
00:41:57,510 --> 00:41:59,348
I wish to heaven it wasn't.

614
00:42:02,230 --> 00:42:04,261
Get me Cranford 647.. Thank you.

615
00:42:08,090 --> 00:42:09,089
Yes.

616
00:42:09,700 --> 00:42:11,100
Inspector Lomax to see you sir.

617
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:12,000
Come in Lomax.

618
00:42:12,210 --> 00:42:13,720
I'm sorry to bother you sir.

619
00:42:15,410 --> 00:42:18,410
Something has come up that..
I'm not sure how to handle.

620
00:42:18,653 --> 00:42:20,053
Sit down, tell me about it.

621
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:24,900
It's.. difficult to know where to begin sir.
The implications are so far reaching.

622
00:42:24,533 --> 00:42:28,653
If there's anything in them that
it's a matter of top policy.

623
00:42:29,375 --> 00:42:30,475
Yes.

624
00:42:30,677 --> 00:42:32,277
Well sir.  It concerns...

625
00:42:39,310 --> 00:42:40,625
It concerns?

626
00:42:41,856 --> 00:42:47,756
Concerns.. the Alman case sir.  The
man we are holding.  I thought if the..

627
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:49,800
If we turn him loose he
might lead us to something.

628
00:42:49,801 --> 00:42:50,401
Right.

629
00:42:50,450 --> 00:42:55,550
Meaning, give us a lead to a
accomplices and I wondered if
you had any views on the subject sir.

630
00:42:56,910 --> 00:43:00,910
The decision is yours Lomax.
You're conversant with the case.

631
00:43:01,370 --> 00:43:05,563
Of course sir.  I'm sorry, I made
a mistake.. bothering you at this hour.

632
00:43:05,770 --> 00:43:06,770
Alright.

633
00:43:07,170 --> 00:43:08,070
Good night sir.

634
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:09,320
Good night.

635
00:43:19,975 --> 00:43:20,975
Yes?

636
00:43:21,100 --> 00:43:24,400
Brand?  This is Quatermass.
I'm at Scotland Yard.

637
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:28,112
Quatermass,  I've been trying to
find you all evening.  We've traced
the source of these things.

638
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:33,711
It's in a freak orbit, on the dark side
of the earth, in a permanent state of
eclipse - that's why it's not visible.

639
00:43:34,050 --> 00:43:37,367
It must be something like an
asteroid, about 200 yards across.

640
00:43:38,090 --> 00:43:39,642
Look, take full records til I get there.

641
00:43:40,270 --> 00:43:41,523
Yes, I'm trying too.

642
00:43:44,410 --> 00:43:46,566
They found the source of
those things.  I'm going back.

643
00:43:46,770 --> 00:43:51,486
Quatermass.  The mark you saw on Marsh
and the other men, desribe it, quick, tell me.

644
00:43:51,930 --> 00:43:56,730
Well it was reddish mark as if it had been
pressed into the skin and left a jagged 'V'.

645
00:43:56,840 --> 00:43:57,840
How big?

646
00:43:58,529 --> 00:43:59,649
About this big.  Why?

647
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:01,800
I've just seen it.

648
00:44:03,230 --> 00:44:05,200
Here?  In this building?

649
00:44:06,650 --> 00:44:07,550
No.

650
00:44:07,790 --> 00:44:08,902
Even here.

651
00:44:09,500 --> 00:44:11,615
I'm try to tell myself there is
nothing to it, but your wrong.

652
00:44:11,805 --> 00:44:13,325
I wasn't wrong last time was I?

653
00:44:19,390 --> 00:44:20,290
Hi, 'general'!

654
00:44:20,295 --> 00:44:21,195
Jimmy what do you want?

655
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:22,140
One and half columns.

656
00:44:22,145 --> 00:44:22,845
Not now I got..

657
00:44:22,850 --> 00:44:26,250
Quatermass.  The rocket man..
that's how I remembered.

658
00:44:26,350 --> 00:44:27,578
Will you leave us alone please.

659
00:44:27,700 --> 00:44:29,014
What's the matter, someone
pinch his rocket?

660
00:44:29,025 --> 00:44:30,625
Jimmy,  I wouldn't want
to have you escorted out.

661
00:44:31,700 --> 00:44:32,600
Who's that?

662
00:44:32,700 --> 00:44:34,800
A Time reporter but
he's harmless enough.

663
00:44:35,650 --> 00:44:40,250
Quatermass, If you could make
it public, put it before the whole
country, everything, all at once.

664
00:44:40,308 --> 00:44:41,308
You mean the press?

665
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:42,715
It must be worth trying.

666
00:44:43,950 --> 00:44:44,550
Jimmy!

667
00:44:44,575 --> 00:44:46,033
Lomax, that man is no condition..

668
00:44:46,034 --> 00:44:48,353
Listen, The drunk Jimmy Hall
is clever.  Sober, he is brilliant.

669
00:44:48,500 --> 00:44:49,795
I was going.  I was going.

670
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:52,715
Listen to me.  You came for a story,
well you are going to get one, the
biggest you've had in your life.

671
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:53,620
At dictation speed!

672
00:44:53,632 --> 00:44:54,432
Do you have a car?

673
00:44:54,435 --> 00:44:55,235
Where are we going?

674
00:44:55,250 --> 00:44:56,050
To your base.

675
00:44:56,060 --> 00:44:59,060
Base?  .. well don't push, I'm going.

676
00:45:00,410 --> 00:45:06,710
See it there?  That point of light at
the intersection.  That's radio waves
being reflected by something out in space.

677
00:45:06,750 --> 00:45:07,550
Is it coming towards us?

678
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:09,300
No, just circling on the
dark side of the earth.

679
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:10,578
And the's life on it?

680
00:45:10,600 --> 00:45:16,000
Not life as we know it.  They probably
had the wrong artificial atmosphere.
Uh, Ammonia.. methane.

681
00:45:16,100 --> 00:45:16,800
Poison gases.

682
00:45:16,868 --> 00:45:20,568
It comes from a region where such
conditions do exist as atmosphere.

683
00:45:20,700 --> 00:45:23,400
The outer planets, maybe a moon of Saturn.

684
00:45:23,700 --> 00:45:24,750
Can I have a scotch in this?

685
00:45:24,760 --> 00:45:25,560
It's growing weaker.

686
00:45:25,600 --> 00:45:28,020
The traces don't..
What's this..(jumbled voices)

687
00:45:28,110 --> 00:45:34,210
I think it's a multiple organism, a
thousand billion intelligences if you
like, but one single consciousness.

688
00:45:34,220 --> 00:45:35,435
Look, I'm a policeman.

689
00:45:35,500 --> 00:45:42,373
Try imagine an organism to
which oxygen is not an essential
of life, but a destroyer.

690
00:45:42,700 --> 00:45:50,400
An organism which is unable to exist
in our atmosphere for more than 3 or
4 seconds, safe only in a shell - like this.

691
00:45:50,590 --> 00:45:54,490
sealed in with a mixture of gases,
methane, maybe even hydrogen.

692
00:45:54,550 --> 00:45:55,706
And when it breaks out?

693
00:45:55,723 --> 00:45:56,723
It dies.

694
00:45:56,800 --> 00:46:03,358
Unless, its energy is expended
on an object that can exist in our
atmoshere, a human target.

695
00:46:04,300 --> 00:46:05,855
And what happens to the human target?

696
00:46:06,100 --> 00:46:08,900
An immediate invasion of his
entire nevous system.

697
00:46:09,130 --> 00:46:13,730
Something is implanted, an instinct,
a blind compulsion to act for them.

698
00:46:14,910 --> 00:46:16,701
You expect to tell my editor that?

699
00:46:18,600 --> 00:46:21,300
But Hall.  You must..
there's no time to lose.

700
00:46:22,019 --> 00:46:26,519
Don't rush me 'general'.  Don't rush me.
You have given me a lot of science talk,
and I'm not very good at it.

701
00:46:26,270 --> 00:46:29,270
Oh, I do understand is somebody
swiped your moon project.

702
00:46:29,300 --> 00:46:36,100
But it never was all mine. This would be
a fairly standard procedure for adapting
living beings on an alien planet.

703
00:46:36,140 --> 00:46:39,540
But Quatermass, If your right,
what's going to happen?
What's the ultimate object?

704
00:46:39,700 --> 00:46:41,500
I hesitate to guess inspector.

705
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:48,037
First a few of these things came here,
at random, scattered and then expended
themselves to a purpose.

706
00:46:48,690 --> 00:46:51,790
A year ago, stage number two,
the concentrated attack.

707
00:46:51,950 --> 00:46:53,122
On Willingdon Flats.

708
00:46:53,500 --> 00:46:56,800
An out of the way village with a
little goverment research plant.

709
00:46:57,100 --> 00:47:00,672
One like that area was taken.
Now they got themselves a colony.

710
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,700
And all this went on for a year
and nobody said anything.

711
00:47:03,900 --> 00:47:06,720
But who knows how many infected
people they've got in high places.

712
00:47:06,750 --> 00:47:08,750
And what about here, can
you be sure of all your staff?

713
00:47:08,856 --> 00:47:11,056
I think so.  I'll step up
security in the morning.

714
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:16,952
The next move is Hall.  We
have got to break this conspiracy
of silence and secret orders.

715
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:18,599
You have got to write this man, now.

716
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:25,218
Look.  Get all this down, I'll check it with
you and then I'll drive you into London.
We don't even dare use a telephone.

717
00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:27,020
How far is this plant from here?

718
00:47:27,030 --> 00:47:28,130
About 90 miles.

719
00:47:28,530 --> 00:47:29,330
I want to see it.

720
00:47:29,450 --> 00:47:30,869
But man, time is desperate.

721
00:47:30,990 --> 00:47:32,687
These people who work here,
are they normal?

722
00:47:32,430 --> 00:47:33,830
At the moment, I think so.

723
00:47:34,269 --> 00:47:35,319
I want to talk to them.

724
00:47:35,325 --> 00:47:36,125
Jimmy!

725
00:47:36,300 --> 00:47:38,600
Relax 'general', We'll
still make the first edition.

726
00:47:38,700 --> 00:47:41,579
I'm lost on all this stuff.  I want
to talk to some numbskulls like myself.

727
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:42,915
Alright we'll go now.

728
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:44,200
For you too, isn't that a risk?

729
00:47:44,225 --> 00:47:46,597
The biggest risk is that the
story won't get in at all.

730
00:47:46,700 --> 00:47:52,200
I'll see you outside in 15 minutes.  There
are certain arrangements I want to make
and an alternative plan in case of an emergency.

731
00:47:52,210 --> 00:47:53,210
You need any help?

732
00:47:53,450 --> 00:47:55,850
I don't we should share that knowledge
in view of where we're going.

733
00:47:55,950 --> 00:47:57,286
I'll see you outside.

734
00:47:58,840 --> 00:48:01,960
Brand,  I want double
security as well at the base.

735
00:48:02,600 --> 00:48:08,100
All gates, rocket firing base, bunkers,
double guard on all points, and I want
to talk to you in the control room.

736
00:48:08,250 --> 00:48:09,010
Right.

737
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:12,353
Get me the Lab guard

738
00:48:12,500 --> 00:48:14,500
I'm making a list of people
I know I can trust.

739
00:48:14,550 --> 00:48:16,865
Good, you keep it.  We'll
need every one of them.

740
00:48:16,870 --> 00:48:17,870
Brad's on the line.

741
00:48:17,900 --> 00:48:20,893
Thank you. This is Quatermass.
What about that analysis?

742
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:24,795
Well, were just finishing sir.  We've
got a 5 cc on that piece of cloth.

743
00:48:24,910 --> 00:48:28,307
It was contact substance, I've never quite
met anything like it before.

744
00:48:28,700 --> 00:48:32,470
It's basically an amoniac corrosive,
highly concentrated.

745
00:48:32,600 --> 00:48:36,100
Yes.. just how poisonous?

746
00:48:37,930 --> 00:48:42,430
I see.. right.. a full report
as soon as you can.

747
00:48:43,590 --> 00:48:44,899
Go see if the car is there.

748
00:48:45,050 --> 00:48:45,850
It is there.

749
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:47,400
Go and see.

750
00:48:48,200 --> 00:48:49,200
Yes sir.

751
00:48:52,630 --> 00:48:53,630
Well?

752
00:48:55,030 --> 00:48:59,900
That black slime.. is deadly
to every living thing on earth.

753
00:49:00,110 --> 00:49:01,610
So it isn't synthetic food?

754
00:49:01,770 --> 00:49:03,483
On the contrary, Lomax, I think it is.

755
00:49:04,370 --> 00:49:09,687
Food for whatever is in those
domes.  Domes, 200 feet high!

756
00:49:20,190 --> 00:49:21,664
I know somebody who you've seen ago.

757
00:49:21,670 --> 00:49:22,470
Who's that?

758
00:49:22,500 --> 00:49:23,672
We'll have four beers to start with.

759
00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:26,713
Oh give it to me.  I do need to thank you
for all this.

760
00:49:30,470 --> 00:49:35,270
Here you are now.  Keep a whiskey
.. keep the change of course
..this for your suffering wife.

761
00:49:35,700 --> 00:49:36,813
Here, that's good Scotch.

762
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:40,120
Aren't you tasting right?
Norman drinks Irish and likes it.

763
00:49:41,150 --> 00:49:43,505
Oooh!  What's he doing?

764
00:49:44,310 --> 00:49:47,525
This is not the nice way to dance
a jig, looks like a trotting horse.

765
00:49:47,600 --> 00:49:49,916
Here, hold this.  Now watch and learn.

766
00:50:02,910 --> 00:50:04,643
I say she, Sheila is the winner.

767
00:50:04,644 --> 00:50:05,764
That wasn't a jig.

768
00:50:05,800 --> 00:50:08,320
Well whatever it was it was
a lot better than yours.

769
00:50:18,350 --> 00:50:19,350
It's jumping.

770
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:20,613
Hi Marilyn.

771
00:50:20,700 --> 00:50:22,100
Hi yourself.

772
00:50:22,830 --> 00:50:24,198
Everybody here work at the plant?

773
00:50:24,250 --> 00:50:25,248
Who wants to know?

774
00:50:25,490 --> 00:50:26,390
Thanks for helping.

775
00:50:26,500 --> 00:50:28,200
But I only got two pair of hands, haven't I?.

776
00:50:28,225 --> 00:50:30,145
Well two gins with a shake's preferred.

777
00:50:30,190 --> 00:50:33,190
Hey..hey,  What are the chances
of a job at that place?

778
00:50:33,450 --> 00:50:34,050
A Job?

779
00:50:34,060 --> 00:50:35,180
Sure, I want work.

780
00:50:35,300 --> 00:50:40,697
Boy, you must have come here just to plant
the marshes and now, it's a real game play.

781
00:50:41,210 --> 00:50:41,910
Be careful Hall.

782
00:50:42,020 --> 00:50:43,140
Better order drinks.

783
00:50:53,990 --> 00:50:55,188
Someone seems to know you.

784
00:50:55,930 --> 00:50:58,045
Yes, we met before, the camp secretary.

785
00:50:58,197 --> 00:50:59,217
Two beers and a double.

786
00:50:59,250 --> 00:51:00,601
What's working conditions like?

787
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:04,500
You mean the plant?  Well, it couldn't be better.
You know what they pay unskilled labour?

788
00:51:04,505 --> 00:51:05,105
Shush!

789
00:51:05,110 --> 00:51:05,710
Uh?

790
00:51:05,720 --> 00:51:07,615
You want a choffee (chocolate)?

791
00:51:08,230 --> 00:51:10,263
Good evening.  What seems
to be the trouble?

792
00:51:10,325 --> 00:51:11,125
No trouble.

793
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:12,911
Someone was asking about
work at the plant.

794
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:14,115
Oh, you three together?

795
00:51:14,412 --> 00:51:15,012
Yes.

796
00:51:15,030 --> 00:51:19,830
Are you looking for heavy constructional work?
Not even if your right, all workman are
engaged with government contractors.

797
00:51:19,850 --> 00:51:21,060
Ah, give it to them straight Max.

798
00:51:21,110 --> 00:51:24,466
There are no jobs.  Even we are
on short time now. (..mixed voices)

799
00:51:24,470 --> 00:51:28,570
The plant's nearly finished.  (..mixed voices)

800
00:51:29,100 --> 00:51:30,939
Zombies are treading on our heels to get out.

801
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:31,700
Zombies?

802
00:51:31,750 --> 00:51:33,589
It's a special nickname given to special persons.

803
00:51:33,700 --> 00:51:37,377
Nicknamed to be working out of parishes?
We hate their guts and don't anyone deny it.

804
00:51:37,390 --> 00:51:37,990
Norman!

805
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:39,050
Now cover your tongue.

806
00:51:39,060 --> 00:51:42,160
Well don't they treat us like dirt when they're
talking to us?  Who do they think they are?

807
00:51:42,250 --> 00:51:43,322
They run the plant?

808
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:44,200
Sure they do.

809
00:51:44,300 --> 00:51:45,200
And do they operate the dome?

810
00:51:45,210 --> 00:51:46,330
No!..no!..

811
00:51:46,500 --> 00:51:47,818
What's inside those domes, Eddie?

812
00:51:47,900 --> 00:51:50,134
Suddenly you know too much.

813
00:51:50,200 --> 00:51:51,800
Yes.. Who are you?

814
00:51:51,850 --> 00:51:55,144
I know him.  He was here two days ago.
Got into trouble with the guards.

815
00:51:55,300 --> 00:51:57,491
And so we don't want any guard
trouble here.  Out with them.

816
00:51:58,200 --> 00:51:59,420
..Wait a minute, listen to me.

817
00:51:59,525 --> 00:52:00,325
You got to tell them.

818
00:52:00,330 --> 00:52:00,930
It's useless.

819
00:52:00,940 --> 00:52:03,460
But you got to try.  Quiet
everyone!  Quiet please!

820
00:52:04,470 --> 00:52:05,370
Quiet everyone!

821
00:52:05,500 --> 00:52:08,450
Listen to me.  This is vitally
important to all of you.

822
00:52:10,500 --> 00:52:12,113
Please, may I have your attention!

823
00:52:12,310 --> 00:52:13,210
What's this all about?

824
00:52:13,220 --> 00:52:14,272
(who is he?)  Who are you?

825
00:52:14,280 --> 00:52:15,180
I'm a police officer.

826
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:16,272
We don't have police here.

827
00:52:16,280 --> 00:52:17,180
Well you have now.

828
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:22,750
Turn that music off.   Now the gentleman
over there is a scientist and I want you
to listen to what he has to say.

829
00:52:22,850 --> 00:52:26,167
If what he says is right, you're
in great danger.  All of you.

830
00:52:26,310 --> 00:52:27,540
Danger!  What danger?

831
00:52:27,600 --> 00:52:28,720
Why are the police here?

832
00:52:28,790 --> 00:52:31,379
It's about that place you've been
working on, helping to build.

833
00:52:31,450 --> 00:52:35,928
He's been spying on the plant and
the man with him was arrested.  Ask
him.  He told me himself.  Ask him.

834
00:52:36,070 --> 00:52:38,989
You think that place is producing
human food.  It's not!

835
00:52:39,270 --> 00:52:40,285
Well, how much do you
know about that?

836
00:52:40,290 --> 00:52:40,990
He's been spying!

837
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:44,912
That plant is producing deadly poison.
Poison to every earthly creature.

838
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:46,000
Who's making poison?

839
00:52:46,100 --> 00:52:47,120
What does he know?

840
00:52:47,140 --> 00:52:50,013
Please.  Let me explain, I can
prove everything I'm saying.

841
00:52:50,020 --> 00:52:50,820
You better my boy.

842
00:52:50,900 --> 00:52:52,050
He's a liar.  Out with him.

843
00:52:52,060 --> 00:52:53,932
We're making poison he says.

844
00:52:54,490 --> 00:52:55,805
Let's kick them out!

845
00:53:01,750 --> 00:53:03,065
Stop this, can't you get..

846
00:53:03,310 --> 00:53:05,310
I wonder why you came
and now am I in big trouble?

847
00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:07,300
Now get out before
there's any more trouble.

848
00:53:09,270 --> 00:53:11,506
Maggie!  Something happened to her.

849
00:53:12,150 --> 00:53:13,150
Keep back everybody!

850
00:53:13,430 --> 00:53:14,430
Take he out now.

851
00:53:15,310 --> 00:53:16,629
It's alright.  Now keep back please.

852
00:53:17,310 --> 00:53:18,563
Nothing to be alarmed about!

853
00:53:20,390 --> 00:53:21,784
It came through the roof.  What was it?

854
00:53:24,230 --> 00:53:25,130
There it is in the floor boards.

855
00:53:25,135 --> 00:53:25,935
Keep back man!

856
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:26,900
Who are you telling to keep back?

857
00:53:26,940 --> 00:53:27,940
It may be dangerous.

858
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:29,820
Dangerous, my foot, it's
an overshot, that's all.

859
00:53:29,900 --> 00:53:30,600
Overshot!

860
00:53:30,318 --> 00:53:31,738
How is she Mack?  Not Bad?

861
00:53:31,750 --> 00:53:33,542
No, It was just fright.

862
00:53:33,600 --> 00:53:34,915
Ahh,  I will be alright in a minute.

863
00:53:35,038 --> 00:53:36,858
Take a bit of this now, Maggie.

864
00:53:37,110 --> 00:53:39,619
Oh, This the first time a carton
has fallen this far away.

865
00:53:39,600 --> 00:53:40,776
called it another shot?

866
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:43,799
That's right.  Those things that fall
outside the plant, usually at night.

867
00:53:43,805 --> 00:53:44,918
What are they supposed to be?

868
00:53:44,940 --> 00:53:47,640
Oh, something to do with
the process.   Don't ask me.

869
00:53:47,650 --> 00:53:49,650
Oh, look at the mess
it's made in the floor.

870
00:53:49,750 --> 00:53:51,883
Stay back girl.  It's a whole one
underneath the floor boards.

871
00:53:51,900 --> 00:53:53,179
We got to get everyone out
of here, quick.

872
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:55,336
Now, come along!  Everybody
outside please.. Come along.

873
00:53:55,340 --> 00:53:57,440
Sorry to interrupt the
festivities, but is she alright?

874
00:53:57,450 --> 00:53:58,570
Yes..

875
00:53:58,650 --> 00:54:00,850
..Okay then, take her outside.
Now come along please..quickly.

876
00:54:01,700 --> 00:54:03,615
Outside.. please.

877
00:54:03,870 --> 00:54:04,947
You must clear this hall.

878
00:54:05,750 --> 00:54:06,969
..(muttering).. Come on now!

879
00:54:07,600 --> 00:54:08,588
Away you go.

880
00:54:08,600 --> 00:54:10,298
What's all the fuss about?

881
00:54:10,300 --> 00:54:11,300
What do you think it's about, a bomb?

882
00:54:11,325 --> 00:54:14,325
Look, no matter what they've
told you about these things, they're
not harmless.  Now along you go!

883
00:54:14,562 --> 00:54:15,562
Let's go please.

884
00:54:16,590 --> 00:54:17,905
Quatermass.

885
00:54:19,950 --> 00:54:21,981
Oh, here it is, it's still warm.

886
00:54:23,070 --> 00:54:26,387
Put it down..as
slowly as you can.

887
00:54:26,470 --> 00:54:29,309
It's only an overshot,
like Patty said.

888
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:30,653
On the floor.

889
00:54:31,750 --> 00:54:33,065
Put it on the floor.

890
00:54:34,750 --> 00:54:36,150
Gentlly.

891
00:54:38,770 --> 00:54:40,085
Sheila.

892
00:54:44,770 --> 00:54:46,085
Look, her neck!

893
00:54:47,850 --> 00:54:50,165
What is it?  Sheila..
What happened?

894
00:54:50,190 --> 00:54:50,990
Can we do anything?

895
00:54:51,065 --> 00:54:51,765
Too late!

896
00:54:52,210 --> 00:54:54,368
You say you know all about
it.  Alright, do something.

897
00:54:54,410 --> 00:54:56,763
There's nothing to do now.
You might call a doctor.  Lomax!

898
00:54:56,800 --> 00:54:57,800
Get a blanket!

899
00:54:59,700 --> 00:55:02,600
The fact that that thing landed so far
from the plant might indicate that..
Come on quick.

900
00:55:03,830 --> 00:55:05,658
..Quick!  Quickly

901
00:55:08,210 --> 00:55:10,489
Sheila.  That thing on her neck.  You all
seen it didn't you?

902
00:55:10,500 --> 00:55:11,300
It came out of the stone.

903
00:55:11,325 --> 00:55:12,625
That fellow said it was dangerous.

904
00:55:14,100 --> 00:55:15,929
Listen.

905
00:55:16,745 --> 00:55:17,745
A sort of whistling.

906
00:55:18,131 --> 00:55:20,231
I was right. The're coming down
by the hundreds.  Get Hall.

907
00:55:21,550 --> 00:55:22,824
This is urgent, priority!

908
00:55:22,900 --> 00:55:23,900
Jimmy, quick, outside.

909
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,815
Be with you in a minute.  I'm
not gonna... News desk quick.

910
00:55:27,500 --> 00:55:29,500
It's a mass dropping
alright.  Were's Hall?

911
00:55:29,510 --> 00:55:30,830
He's phoning his story.

912
00:55:31,300 --> 00:55:33,248
Not from here.  I told him
not to use the phone here.

913
00:55:33,377 --> 00:55:34,597
Quatermass, look.

914
00:55:55,190 --> 00:55:56,990
These things are coming in large
numbers from outside the earth.

915
00:55:57,000 --> 00:56:01,550
Look, just print this
story with..hold on.

916
00:56:23,050 --> 00:56:26,065
What did this?  You know what
did it.  Tell us and try to save her.

917
00:56:26,770 --> 00:56:27,961
Do you hear what I say?

918
00:56:28,100 --> 00:56:29,528
Steady buddy, steady.

919
00:56:30,190 --> 00:56:36,440
..and yet, These things arrive in stone
containers, and form of meteorite.  They
have been coming for past 18 months.

920
00:56:36,700 --> 00:56:37,900
The fool, why doesn't he come out?

921
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:39,200
If he lies low he has a chance.

922
00:56:40,910 --> 00:56:44,227
Contact with these things produces
a violent infection.  A sort of stain.

923
00:56:44,370 --> 00:56:46,003
I've just seen it happen.

924
00:56:46,090 --> 00:56:47,848
Stay on the line.  I think
I've been spotted.

925
00:56:52,630 --> 00:56:55,390
Get this quickly.  This
infection is widespread..

926
00:57:04,930 --> 00:57:06,263
What can you do now?

927
00:57:10,590 --> 00:57:11,440
Where to, London?

928
00:57:11,650 --> 00:57:12,750
No, the plant.

929
00:57:37,330 --> 00:57:38,645
Look out!

930
00:57:49,170 --> 00:57:50,883
Squads of them down there.

931
00:57:52,570 --> 00:57:53,685
Lomax!

932
00:57:55,110 --> 00:57:56,110
Look at this.

933
00:57:56,170 --> 00:57:58,830
Steel containers filled with their
own atmosphere.  Gas supply.

934
00:57:59,290 --> 00:58:01,741
They must put them in here so they
can get them back to the plant alive.

935
00:58:01,745 --> 00:58:02,545
Well don't touch it.

936
00:58:02,550 --> 00:58:03,770
You take the car and go back to London.

937
00:58:03,775 --> 00:58:04,475
Go Back?..

938
00:58:04,480 --> 00:58:08,180
Talk to people you can trust.
Contact every one of them.
Make them listen before it's too late.

939
00:58:08,930 --> 00:58:10,964
If you ask me, we should both go back.

940
00:58:11,030 --> 00:58:12,924
I've got to get into that plant.
I may be able to do something.

941
00:58:12,940 --> 00:58:13,940
Now wait minute.

942
00:58:15,210 --> 00:58:17,241
It's up to you now, must hurry.

943
00:58:25,250 --> 00:58:26,886
Don't go slow.  Keep together.

944
00:58:27,790 --> 00:58:29,383
How do we know they
took her this way?

945
00:58:29,450 --> 00:58:30,767
They would have moved
her to the medical centre.

946
00:58:30,800 --> 00:58:32,020
That's where they'll be at the plant.

947
00:58:32,225 --> 00:58:34,825
Poor Kid.. They knew what
it was and wouldn't say.

948
00:58:35,450 --> 00:58:38,275
That stranger, what'd he done to get
his face all shot up like that?

949
00:58:38,280 --> 00:58:40,700
Filthy murdering swine.  They
are going to get it tonight.

950
00:58:41,210 --> 00:58:42,210
Look out!

951
00:58:42,800 --> 00:58:44,877
Lights ahead.  A car.

952
00:58:44,900 --> 00:58:48,058
Wait boys!  Hold your ground.
Right across the road.

953
00:58:54,210 --> 00:58:55,840
Let me through.  Stand clear.

954
00:58:55,900 --> 00:58:56,600
It's the cop.

955
00:58:56,620 --> 00:58:57,320
What's this about?

956
00:58:57,340 --> 00:58:58,140
We're going to the plant.

957
00:58:58,350 --> 00:59:01,170
Well get back to your homes, you can't
do anything, you'll only run into trouble.

958
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:03,500
We're after the men that killed your pal.

959
00:59:03,525 --> 00:59:04,475
And they have taken young Sheila.

960
00:59:04,480 --> 00:59:06,631
Go back to your homes.  You'll do
more good if you go back.

961
00:59:06,700 --> 00:59:08,300
We could use the car.  Turn it 'round.

962
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:11,500
..stop.  ..I'm on my way for help.
Go back home.

963
00:59:53,650 --> 00:59:58,366
For all special personnel, bring
containers all in..bring containers all in.

964
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:01,633
Higher!  Higher!

965
01:00:01,930 --> 01:00:03,405
The next main shipment is on its way.

966
01:00:23,570 --> 01:00:28,127
For all special personnel,
keep the containers away.

967
01:01:44,570 --> 01:01:50,887
Attention! attention!  All special personel,
emergency!  Procede with quickness to gate 4.

968
01:01:51,890 --> 01:01:55,285
Go to gate 4!  Emergency!  Emergency!

969
01:01:56,290 --> 01:01:59,290
All special personnel emergency at gate 4.

970
01:01:59,400 --> 01:02:01,253
Emergency!  Emergency!

971
01:02:01,750 --> 01:02:04,418
Procede with quickness to gate 4

972
01:02:04,570 --> 01:02:09,127
Special direct handling..
Emergency on gate 4

973
01:02:16,810 --> 01:02:18,409
Emergency!  Emergency

974
01:02:42,170 --> 01:02:46,283
Gate 4.  There are construction workers
estimated at 150 in number.

975
01:02:52,890 --> 01:02:57,288
Let's end it here..
I told you this is useless.

976
01:02:59,090 --> 01:03:02,282
Leave, Get away from the gates.

977
01:03:02,600 --> 01:03:04,711
Entry is prohibited.

978
01:03:06,210 --> 01:03:08,321
Do not approach the gates.

979
01:03:08,370 --> 01:03:09,685
Do not approach.

980
01:03:58,370 --> 01:04:00,448
For special personal,
shoot to kill.

981
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:02,952
Don't regret this decision,
and shoot to kill.

982
01:04:03,890 --> 01:04:08,481
Special personnel, for emergency
decisions, shoot to kill.

983
01:04:08,609 --> 01:04:10,709
Shoot to kill.

984
01:05:01,650 --> 01:05:03,488
Hey they're getting to cover!

985
01:05:06,850 --> 01:05:11,487
Special personnel, bring them out
in the open and shoot to kill.

986
01:05:19,450 --> 01:05:20,969
Come!  Shut the door, fast!

987
01:05:26,290 --> 01:05:27,889
Don't shoot!  Hold you fire.

988
01:05:28,010 --> 01:05:29,010
Wait!

989
01:05:30,610 --> 01:05:31,310
Quatermass!

990
01:05:31,315 --> 01:05:32,315
You!

991
01:05:33,810 --> 01:05:35,648
..Take these guns.

992
01:05:37,650 --> 01:05:38,500
Cover this window.

993
01:05:38,505 --> 01:05:39,783
You hit?  What happened?

994
01:05:39,800 --> 01:05:41,915
I tried to stop them but there
was a gun battle at the gates.

995
01:05:41,920 --> 01:05:42,940
Hey, look at this.

996
01:05:43,500 --> 01:05:44,200
What is it?

997
01:05:44,220 --> 01:05:44,920
Emergency weapons.

998
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:45,700
Try to get it open.

999
01:05:45,710 --> 01:05:46,310
Tom!

1000
01:05:46,715 --> 01:05:47,415
How bad is it?

1001
01:05:47,420 --> 01:05:48,751
Shertow, what happens if we stay tight?

1002
01:05:48,900 --> 01:05:50,294
Can this be opened from outside?

1003
01:05:50,300 --> 01:05:50,900
No!

1004
01:05:50,956 --> 01:05:52,356
Well, we got a breather anyway.

1005
01:05:52,770 --> 01:05:53,879
How long is another matter.

1006
01:05:53,880 --> 01:05:54,880
Then, you didn't make your contacts?

1007
01:05:54,890 --> 01:05:56,490
I'm afraid the world isn't going to know yet.

1008
01:05:56,890 --> 01:05:59,705
They're still at it.  One
of the new armed people left.

1009
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:04,553
This is madness, staying here like
rats in a trap.  I'd rather be outside.
..So expect me out of here.

1010
01:06:04,600 --> 01:06:05,915
Don't be a fool.  Shertow!

1011
01:06:08,170 --> 01:06:09,963
One grenade through that window,
..we'll be blown to pieces.

1012
01:06:09,999 --> 01:06:12,299
No, can't be an attack here. This
room is for pressure control.

1013
01:06:12,300 --> 01:06:13,120
Pressure control?

1014
01:06:13,130 --> 01:06:15,130
This is the pressure control centre.
I helped build this.

1015
01:06:15,190 --> 01:06:16,990
You mean they feed those
domes from here?

1016
01:06:17,170 --> 01:06:19,570
Each dome is controlled
by a separate section.

1017
01:06:26,750 --> 01:06:30,659
Ammonia, methane,
hydrogen, oxygen.

1018
01:06:40,330 --> 01:06:41,330
Oxygen!

1019
01:06:42,010 --> 01:06:44,849
It could be that they are
being acclimatized.

1020
01:06:45,810 --> 01:06:48,304
..On my Cue.  Get me a hand on these controls.

1021
01:06:48,970 --> 01:06:50,842
This will be a long shot
but we've got to take it.

1022
01:06:51,330 --> 01:06:52,806
Now both of you watch me.

1023
01:06:53,830 --> 01:06:56,961
Do the same with those panels.
Cut off the gas supply completely.

1024
01:06:58,110 --> 01:07:00,762
Set them at zero..
Like this.

1025
01:07:01,790 --> 01:07:05,027
That should bring the..oxygen
up to full pressure.

1026
01:07:05,050 --> 01:07:06,050
What's this going to do?

1027
01:07:06,150 --> 01:07:07,642
Choke what's in those domes I hope.

1028
01:07:07,700 --> 01:07:08,500
You seen?

1029
01:07:08,700 --> 01:07:09,500
I seen.

1030
01:07:10,010 --> 01:07:11,010
What was it?

1031
01:07:12,010 --> 01:07:12,810
They're moving in.

1032
01:07:12,820 --> 01:07:14,339
Attention!  Attention!

1033
01:07:15,130 --> 01:07:19,766
Unauthorized personel now, must
get out of controlled blocks.
Resistence by you must cease.

1034
01:07:19,810 --> 01:07:22,207
Lay down your weapons and
leave the building.

1035
01:07:22,670 --> 01:07:25,384
You will be permitted to go to your
homes pending further action.

1036
01:07:26,610 --> 01:07:28,068
Leave the building at once.

1037
01:07:29,410 --> 01:07:30,410
They're still there.

1038
01:07:30,470 --> 01:07:31,942
Abandon your weapons and come out!

1039
01:07:32,690 --> 01:07:34,143
Come out and be shot
to bits is that it?

1040
01:07:34,200 --> 01:07:35,520
I think we ought to
know what they say.

1041
01:07:35,690 --> 01:07:39,121
We're holding this block.  We've got to,
at least until the oxygen takes affect.

1042
01:07:39,170 --> 01:07:40,364
That's a no go, is it?

1043
01:07:40,400 --> 01:07:42,977
Resistance must cease immediately.
Lay down you arms..

1044
01:07:42,978 --> 01:07:44,278
Yes, what is it to kill us!

1045
01:07:44,714 --> 01:07:46,434
Inside those domes are creatures
from outside this earth.

1046
01:07:46,450 --> 01:07:47,350
Aw, you're mad!

1047
01:07:47,500 --> 01:07:52,453
I've seen them.  Thousands of tiny
creatures that can join together and
expand into things a hundred feet high.

1048
01:07:52,455 --> 01:07:54,330
And each one can infect a human being.

1049
01:07:54,370 --> 01:07:55,470
 Like it did Sheila?

1050
01:07:55,500 --> 01:07:59,000
Yes, and those wretched creatures
you call zombies; take a look at 'em,
you'll find the mark.

1051
01:07:59,500 --> 01:08:01,350
To all unauthorized personel,
Check on your progress.

1052
01:08:01,400 --> 01:08:06,900
You will not be harmed.  Leave the
building at once or other means of
forcing your surrender will be used.

1053
01:08:07,610 --> 01:08:09,004
How long before that
oxygen takes effect?

1054
01:08:09,005 --> 01:08:10,279
How can I tell?  May be hours.

1055
01:08:10,518 --> 01:08:11,818
And what time are the others coming?

1056
01:08:11,900 --> 01:08:15,037
They will be, unless we can destroy the
asteroid, the thing they're coming from.

1057
01:08:15,100 --> 01:08:15,900
How are you doing?

1058
01:08:15,950 --> 01:08:17,582
But your emergency plan, what was it?

1059
01:08:17,650 --> 01:08:19,581
To use the rocket that
guided the atomic bomb.

1060
01:08:19,600 --> 01:08:20,700
And when was that to happen?

1061
01:08:20,710 --> 01:08:23,230
I told Brand that if he didn't hear
from me to set it off by midnight.

1062
01:08:27,470 --> 01:08:30,707
But you're not seriously going to
launch that,..that 'bomb'

1063
01:08:31,139 --> 01:08:32,959
This is it Peterson.  Control room!

1064
01:08:41,790 --> 01:08:46,705
Michaels.  Brand.  Check rocket
motors set to critical phase. We're
launching.  Don't argue, do it.

1065
01:08:53,930 --> 01:09:00,569
Attention everyone!  Brand to all
sections. Clear base for firing.  Repeat,
clear base for firing.  Immediately!

1066
01:09:01,010 --> 01:09:03,468
How do we know it'll even
take off without blowing up?

1067
01:09:04,110 --> 01:09:05,425
We don't.

1068
01:09:19,330 --> 01:09:20,883
Check.  Fuel on.

1069
01:09:28,800 --> 01:09:30,149
Fuel on.

1070
01:09:35,770 --> 01:09:37,085
Compression.

1071
01:09:41,190 --> 01:09:42,505
Compression.

1072
01:09:45,070 --> 01:09:46,385
Marsh!

1073
01:09:55,190 --> 01:09:56,943
Don't touch him.  Don't touch anything.

1074
01:09:57,250 --> 01:09:58,724
Come!

1075
01:10:56,810 --> 01:10:57,946
Now get that wrench on the bottom.

1076
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:00,100
Never thought I'd be using
a crowbar with a cop.

1077
01:11:04,210 --> 01:11:05,110
They were really benefitted.

1078
01:11:05,130 --> 01:11:06,130
Anti tank guns.

1079
01:11:06,140 --> 01:11:08,360
We'll need more than any anti tank
guns to get us out of this.

1080
01:11:08,470 --> 01:11:09,984
Somebody is shooting off flares.

1081
01:11:10,200 --> 01:11:11,000
Flares!

1082
01:11:11,230 --> 01:11:13,119
Right across the sky.  Way up!

1083
01:11:14,200 --> 01:11:14,800
Where?

1084
01:11:14,809 --> 01:11:17,609
It's gone now.. No,
there it is.  Is it a flare?

1085
01:11:17,615 --> 01:11:19,915
No!.. It is not a flare.

1086
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:21,000
What is it?

1087
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:23,999
It's the one thing that may
save us, and humanity.

1088
01:11:49,290 --> 01:11:51,162
Too cursed quiet for my liking.

1089
01:11:52,170 --> 01:11:52,870
What are they up to?

1090
01:11:52,910 --> 01:11:54,868
Yes.  What was the other means?

1091
01:11:54,929 --> 01:11:56,749
Probably just a war of nerves.

1092
01:11:56,850 --> 01:11:57,750
Any reaction yet?

1093
01:11:57,800 --> 01:12:01,880
I've done all I can.  Pure oxygen, it
must be taking effect by now, it must.

1094
01:12:01,890 --> 01:12:06,880
Quatermass, What happens if we
fire an anti tank smack into the dome?

1095
01:12:08,610 --> 01:12:15,910
Whatever came out would be completely
beyond our control.  Now, it is the best
to poison them slowly if we can.

1096
01:12:16,230 --> 01:12:18,843
If!  If you can.  It's a lot of ifs mister..

1097
01:12:18,844 --> 01:12:22,435
How long are we going to trust you'll get
it?  All this gab about a rocket and things.

1098
01:12:22,440 --> 01:12:24,159
What's so possible you know
what you are talking about?

1099
01:12:24,200 --> 01:12:29,309
You must believe me.  We're all that
stands between these things taking
possesion of perhaps the whole world.

1100
01:12:29,500 --> 01:12:31,312
Spreading over it and affecting every..

1101
01:12:31,313 --> 01:12:33,469
Nobody has seen these
mysterious things but you.

1102
01:12:33,690 --> 01:12:35,926
Attention!  Attention!

1103
01:12:36,630 --> 01:12:38,946
Switch off.  Switch off.

1104
01:12:38,890 --> 01:12:40,921
The sabotage must cease!

1105
01:12:41,470 --> 01:12:45,539
Switch off.  Switch off.  Oxygen now
being passed through to the domes..

1106
01:12:46,090 --> 01:12:47,284
It's working!

1107
01:12:49,390 --> 01:12:50,785
..and are still anxious to cooperate.

1108
01:12:51,130 --> 01:12:55,130
Anyone injured in recent violence
or should need treatment, go now!
Hurry!

1109
01:12:55,750 --> 01:12:56,865
Okay!, Me too!

1110
01:12:57,100 --> 01:12:58,170
Stay where you are.  It's a trick.

1111
01:12:58,180 --> 01:13:00,795
Maybe it is, but who's trick.  You saw
your friends murdered out there.

1112
01:13:00,800 --> 01:13:03,300
Police. We were caught we arrived.  We
have only his word, and if we were wrong..

1113
01:13:03,325 --> 01:13:06,325
He'd know that this is what was represented
to him, but what proof has he given us?

1114
01:13:06,330 --> 01:13:09,920
This is the last appeal to
you as reasonable men.

1115
01:13:11,570 --> 01:13:13,123
Hello! Hello!

1116
01:13:13,690 --> 01:13:17,790
My name's McLeod.  I'm speaking
from the pressure control block.
Put me through.  Put me through.

1117
01:13:17,930 --> 01:13:18,930
Who's speaking?

1118
01:13:19,399 --> 01:13:22,799
E. G. McCloud, Charge hand Welder.
We want to know what's inside those domes.

1119
01:13:22,850 --> 01:13:25,550
There's a fellow here who says
there's living things in them.

1120
01:13:26,010 --> 01:13:27,399
McCloud, don't be a fool.

1121
01:13:27,400 --> 01:13:28,955
Leave me alone, I want to speak to him.

1122
01:13:28,960 --> 01:13:31,809
Let him speak.  There is nothing
to hide in the domes.

1123
01:13:31,950 --> 01:13:32,750
They are lying.

1124
01:13:32,755 --> 01:13:35,955
The entire compound is very
efficient. Whatever you may
wish to see we will show you..

1125
01:13:36,090 --> 01:13:36,940
Don't listen to them.

1126
01:13:36,950 --> 01:13:38,265
..Help me Paddy.

1127
01:13:38,310 --> 01:13:39,625
Leave him!  Leave him, will you!

1128
01:13:40,770 --> 01:13:44,085
McCloud here.  I'm accepting your offer.
I want to see inside one of the domes.

1129
01:13:44,530 --> 01:13:45,530
Don't do it McCloud!

1130
01:13:45,600 --> 01:13:48,030
Come alone or be in company with others hired.

1131
01:13:48,490 --> 01:13:50,829
We will meet in just two minutes
on the outside of dome 3.

1132
01:13:50,870 --> 01:13:52,088
.. Dawson, are you coming?

1133
01:13:52,100 --> 01:13:52,800
Yes!

1134
01:13:52,801 --> 01:13:54,974
I'm on my way. Finally you
have me.  You stay down here.

1135
01:13:55,226 --> 01:13:56,346
You'll all be infected.

1136
01:13:56,400 --> 01:13:57,500
All right everyone, relax.

1137
01:13:58,010 --> 01:13:59,963
Arnie.  Keep them covered in case.

1138
01:14:16,450 --> 01:14:17,642
The men aren't in uniforms.

1139
01:14:18,358 --> 01:14:19,578
Don't count any of them.

1140
01:14:20,130 --> 01:14:21,422
Did they mean it?

1141
01:14:22,490 --> 01:14:24,919
They'll be infected, that must
be the purpose of this.

1142
01:14:24,925 --> 01:14:25,945
That's what I'm afraid of.

1143
01:14:26,490 --> 01:14:27,926
And they will put one
of them on the speaker.

1144
01:14:28,741 --> 01:14:30,141
Now listen.  He's right.

1145
01:14:30,730 --> 01:14:34,545
Any moment now, McCloud or one of
the others will talk to you over that
and tell you everything is all right.

1146
01:14:34,550 --> 01:14:36,406
but I beg of you, don't believe them.

1147
01:14:37,490 --> 01:14:39,123
What's that?

1148
01:14:41,610 --> 01:14:43,207
It's carrying along one of the pipes.

1149
01:14:43,550 --> 01:14:44,550
Those were screams.

1150
01:14:44,555 --> 01:14:45,875
If they come back I'm gonna..

1151
01:14:46,090 --> 01:14:46,890
Quiet!

1152
01:14:50,290 --> 01:14:52,064
Attention!..Attention!

1153
01:14:53,210 --> 01:14:56,525
Connecting..What?..Emergency!

1154
01:14:57,850 --> 01:14:59,850
It's going red.  We're going to have to be
ready for anything.

1155
01:15:01,050 --> 01:15:02,303
It's here in the room.

1156
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:04,233
Look, the pipe, it's burst!

1157
01:15:07,930 --> 01:15:09,404
It's alright, only oxygen.

1158
01:15:09,450 --> 01:15:10,844
What's happened?

1159
01:15:10,930 --> 01:15:12,747
Dome 3.  Look at that pressure.

1160
01:15:12,800 --> 01:15:13,820
No wonder it blew.

1161
01:15:15,090 --> 01:15:17,921
That pipe must be blocked..
at the other end.

1162
01:15:18,570 --> 01:15:21,619
Blocked with what?..Blocked
with what mister?

1163
01:15:22,010 --> 01:15:23,438
There's someting dripping!

1164
01:15:24,530 --> 01:15:25,530
It's blood!

1165
01:15:25,890 --> 01:15:29,287
It's them, McLeod and
Dawson.  It must be.

1166
01:15:29,430 --> 01:15:31,829
The things turned on them.  They used
them to stop the flow of oxygen.

1167
01:15:32,050 --> 01:15:34,750
That pipe has been blocked
with human pulp.

1168
01:15:34,890 --> 01:15:35,590
No, Quatermass.

1169
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:37,000
Those filthy
murdering swine.

1170
01:15:36,990 --> 01:15:38,305
No!

1171
01:15:48,690 --> 01:15:50,305
I got it!  The whole Dome!

1172
01:15:51,950 --> 01:15:53,061
Cover!

1173
01:15:53,970 --> 01:15:55,703
The masks!  Put on the masks.

1174
01:15:57,530 --> 01:15:58,804
There's one down there.

1175
01:17:32,450 --> 01:17:33,765
Down, down.  Get down!

1176
01:17:37,490 --> 01:17:39,009
Go to the truck!

1177
01:17:48,370 --> 01:17:49,370
Look out,  get!

1178
01:17:50,287 --> 01:17:51,407
He won't follow us now.

1179
01:17:51,850 --> 01:17:53,563
He's dead.  To the truck, quick.

1180
01:18:07,930 --> 01:18:09,802
Look!  The gates are closed!

1181
01:18:10,290 --> 01:18:11,684
Hold on!

1182
01:18:22,290 --> 01:18:23,090
He's alive.

1183
01:18:23,100 --> 01:18:23,800
Just about.

1184
01:18:23,805 --> 01:18:24,505
Throw him out!

1185
01:18:24,600 --> 01:18:27,000
No,  we need him..
We need him for proof.

1186
01:18:27,370 --> 01:18:28,685
No No No!

1187
01:18:30,490 --> 01:18:32,442
The pain is driving them mad.

1188
01:18:42,730 --> 01:18:43,730
The rocket?

1189
01:18:43,782 --> 01:18:45,082
Either it blew itself up or..

1190
01:18:45,130 --> 01:18:46,922
Look at them. They're breaking.

1191
01:18:52,890 --> 01:18:54,603
Get under cover.  Put your masks on.

1192
01:19:38,210 --> 01:19:39,210
It's over.

1193
01:19:39,570 --> 01:19:40,570
Quatermass!

1194
01:19:45,050 --> 01:19:46,050
Get him.

1195
01:19:50,050 --> 01:19:51,322
The mark, it's gone.

1196
01:19:52,370 --> 01:19:55,470
The infection must be
wearing off..leaving them.

1197
01:19:56,590 --> 01:19:57,890
Perhaps all of them.

1198
01:19:58,410 --> 01:19:59,868
What's happened?  Where is this?

1199
01:20:00,017 --> 01:20:01,137
You'll be alright now..

1200
01:20:01,140 --> 01:20:02,540
Lean on me mate.  You'll be alright.

1201
01:20:07,610 --> 01:20:12,281
You know what worries me.
How am I going to make a
final report about all this?

1202
01:20:12,330 --> 01:20:16,045
What worries me
is how final can it be.

1203
01:20:17,950 --> 01:20:19,265
Hey!
