1
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,082
(crowd talking)

2
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:21,441
(murmuring)

3
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:25,322
(hit)

4
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:30,851
Narrator: This was the Open
when everything seemed to happen.

5
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,082
(upbeat music)

6
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:37,930
(fire crackling)

7
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:50,484
On the second day,
the boy Ballesteros was now six under par.

8
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:53,007
And led outright by two strokes.

9
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:56,642
(crowd applauding)

10
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:03,521
But, inevitably, the power of world golf
had begun to close in.

11
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:05,330
Gary Player.

12
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:07,084
Johnny Miller.

13
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:08,765
Jack Nicklaus.

14
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:14,811
Severiano Ballesteros, only nineteen.

15
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:17,970
(crowd applauding)

16
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:19,531
Everyone enjoying him

17
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:23,122
and waiting for him to vanish from the leaderboard.

18
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:27,009
I remember watching this "boy".

19
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:32,200
I watched the way that he did things
and it was a little bit unique.

20
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:34,370
(crowd applauding)

21
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:37,285
Here was this young guy ﬂashing a ball,

22
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:40,205
playing great recoveries and holing the putts

23
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:44,524
<i>and a great smile and I said:
"This is a very special young man."</i>

24
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:50,680
We all thought, who the devil
is this young matador of the links?

25
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,882
Broadcaster: Straight in the middle.

26
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:56,886
Peter Allies: And of course his story was
quite extraordinary.

27
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:59,122
(crowd applauding)

28
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,362
(soothing piano music)

29
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:12,242
(rhythmic guitar joins in)

30
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,371
Seve: My love was always playing golf.

31
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,531
Apart from golf, nothing existed for me.

32
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:27,845
Nothing.

33
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:41,610
(ﬂute joins in) (men shouting in Spanish)

34
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:05,722
(men shout louder)

35
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:11,682
(cheering)

36
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:21,049
Father:

37
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,722
(music fades out)

38
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:40,002
Brother:

39
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:06,722
(man singing a capella)

40
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,808
There's the church, right here.

41
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,770
It's pretty old.

42
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:36,249
And the school is on the right.

43
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,970
Right here.

44
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,690
There's my school.

45
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:47,006
The golf course is right here.
Here is the sixth hole, down there.

46
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:53,083
There's bad roads here, eh.

47
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:57,402
(soft acoustic guitar music)

48
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,488
That's where I lived.

49
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:12,726
Seve: The house is about 100 years old
and it was a quite solid house I think.

50
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:16,123
My father, he was a farmer.

51
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:23,771
My father really worked very hard
but my mother worked even harder.

52
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:27,845
She spent all her life for the family.

53
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:35,165
Seve:

54
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:39,291
Brother:

55
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,243
Brother:

56
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:49,642
(cows mooing)

57
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:09,962
(chicken cackles)

58
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:14,042
(clanging)

59
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:51,291
Mother:

60
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,082
(acoustic guitar music)

61
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:39,922
(waves crashing)

62
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:45,246
Seve: There's many ways to play golf.

63
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:48,520
You can build your own golf course

64
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:51,729
by using your imagination-- wife all.

65
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:17,043
Seve: Well, because I was not allowed
to play or practice on the golf course,

66
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:18,810
I used to play on the beach.

67
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:41,129
I used to practice seven, eight hours per day.

68
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:52,003
No!

69
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:53,969
(Splashes)

70
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,322
(sewing machine rattles)

71
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,210
Mother:

72
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:54,888
(fade in; applause)

73
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,847
Broadcaster: Severiano Ballesteros,
only nineteen coming here this morning,

74
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,446
leading a field of world-class golfers.

75
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:08,246
<i>Never before, in the history of this great championship,</i>

76
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:11,324
had a Spaniard been leading the whole field.

77
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:15,491
Yes! It's right in the middle of the hole.

78
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:20,968
<i>He's realty tweaking their noses.
What great stuff from this youngster.</i>

79
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:26,210
Can Ballesteros possibly make it?

80
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:28,488
He's newborn into world-class golf

81
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:32,611
and some say this very innocence
makes him oblivious to pressure.

82
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:34,765
(hit)

83
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:42,323
Seve: <i>First, a' was hitting the bah'
ah' over the place</i>

84
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:45,563
<i>and started making double bogies and triple bogies</i>

85
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,046
Broadcaster: Oh, oh, oh.

86
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:53,487
Wife. That's in trouble.

87
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:05,088
Ballesteros battling to get back into second place

88
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:08,762
but he's got a long, long putt here for an Eagle three.

89
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,924
Right in for an Eagle.

90
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:19,243
Quite astonishing, this young Spanish player.

91
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:24,046
Miller actually congratulates him on that monster putt.

92
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:32,600
No, he wants to get it in two more from here

93
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:35,286
to tie with Nicklaus for second place.

94
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:44,401
I said he was about the only one that I
saw coming along that really impressed me.

95
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:49,361
He was tremendous around the green.
He had a lot of imagination.

96
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,450
Broadcaster: Yes!

97
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,170
(applause)

98
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:56,846
Broadcaster: Absolutely marvellous!

99
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,770
Straight in the middle!

100
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:09,767
What a prospect for the future and what
an exciting end to this championship.

101
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:15,001
That great chip-and-run
between the bunkers on eighteen,

102
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:18,926
man, that's a great shot.
I was very impressed with that.

103
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:22,328
(applause)

104
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:40,371
Señoras y señores, muchas gracias...

105
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:42,602
(crowd laughs and applauds)

106
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:51,280
Broadcaster: He may have made a heart
throb among the girls of Southport...

107
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:11,882
(acoustic guitar music)

108
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:50,362
(bell rings)

109
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,928
(voice fades out)

110
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:04,605
Seve: In my mind,

111
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:10,563
I always dreamed and I always visualized
myself as becoming a champion.

112
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:18,169
Broadcaster: Ballesteros is just about
to enter Leven's tigerish finish.

113
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:22,641
It's good. It's got the tail wind.

114
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:29,325
Oh yes! And the young matador
ls absolutely delighted!

115
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:32,848
Against all the odds he takes the outright lead yer again

116
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,571
and can't wait to get to the next hole.

117
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:39,767
Strong breeze, so it's rather bold...

118
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:41,490
(applause)

119
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:43,688
Broadcaster: He ﬂipped that one up.

120
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:47,563
He's running, he's jumping, he's hurling.

121
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:53,409
He really is charged up. This is what it
means by having your adrenaline ﬂowing.

122
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:56,131
He had a great walk about him. His gait.

123
00:15:57,400 --> 00:16:00,290
He just strolled like a champion.

124
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:03,209
(hit)

125
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:07,081
Broadcaster: Well he's over on the
right-hand side somewhere.

126
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:09,368
Looks like he's in the parking lot.

127
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:15,401
Yes, he's certainly in the car park.
He's right up against the cars here.

128
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:18,090
So where must I drop?

129
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:24,202
You take the nearest point giving you
complete relief, no nearer the hole.

130
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:27,887
- Well it must be over there, right?
- Wife correct.

131
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:33,285
Seve: Over the years I've been called
the car park champion.

132
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,010
(hit)

133
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:38,209
Interviewer: Do you resent that?
Do you mind that?

134
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:40,601
Seve: Golf is not how, it's how many.

135
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:51,921
Broadcaster: Two putts from here
to remain two ahead.

136
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:55,408
Crowd: Oh! Whoa! Yeah!
(applause)

137
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:57,927
Broadcaster: And he only needs one!

138
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:04,201
Well, the golfing gods really are
with the smiling Spaniard today.

139
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:10,726
Hale Irwin, who was two shots ahead, out of it now.

140
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:15,050
But perhaps we are just moments away
from Severiano Ballesteros

141
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:18,841
becoming the youngest Open champion of this century.

142
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:21,485
(hit)

143
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:26,803
Broadcaster: He's played it out safely for
the front of the green.

144
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:30,810
(crowd cheering)

145
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:38,566
Broadcaster: Irwin going through the crowd
and surrendering.

146
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:43,601
Somewhere back in the mass, Ballesteros
still battling his way through.

147
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,522
(mild applause)

148
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:03,643
<i>Broadcaster: And what a finish!
What a grandstand finish yet again</i>

149
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:05,689
from the young Spanish wizard.

150
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,730
(applause)

151
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:13,327
Broadcaster: Ballesteros is the champion!

152
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:17,724
Interviewer: Who were the two men who
came up and threw their arms around you?

153
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:21,123
Seve: My brothers.
We are all the brothers here.

154
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:29,162
Please, he hasn't yet recorded.
He hasn't yet recorded.

155
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:33,450
Seve: Having all three of my brothers
there with me and supporting me

156
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:36,809
and seeing all of them just running through the green

157
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:40,282
and giving me a big hug-
and I saw my brother crying.

158
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:46,441
They realized that I did something very important.

159
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:49,405
Broadcaster: Severiano Ballesteros...

160
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:52,171
(applause)

161
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:24,802
(crowd cheering)

162
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:40,123
Seve: It never crossed my mind
to finish second.

163
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:42,527
Second... no one would remember.

164
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:45,890
I have to be the champion.

165
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:08,969
Mother:

166
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:12,524
Seve, Seve, Seve...

167
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:17,247
Seve: I missed school many, many days.

168
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:20,882
My father and my mother think I go to school,

169
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:24,044
but most of the days I didn't go.

170
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:26,441
I'd make a little turn to the left.

171
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:29,202
(acoustic guitar music)

172
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:38,371
Seve: Playing golf with only one club,
you see, a three iron,

173
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:42,889
that really helped me a lot because, you know,

174
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:45,884
I have to hit all kinds of shots with only one club.

175
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:49,123
I have to putt, I have to drive with the three iron.

176
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:53,001
That is why I have a very good ability, you know.

177
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:59,127
If you play with only one club, it makes you think...

178
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:20,611
(piano jazz music)
Broadcaster: April.

179
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:28,886
Georgia. USA.
It's Masters time again.

180
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:32,083
(hit)

181
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:36,766
Paired with Gary Player in this final round

182
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:41,687
is 21 years old today Spanish star Severiano Ballesteros.

183
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:45,561
Winner of twenty professional tournaments around the globe

184
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:47,927
before he even got the key to the door.

185
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:52,369
Seve: Gary Player was always my hero.

186
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:55,524
And I wished already that we were friends.

187
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:57,842
He is like my father.

188
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:03,170
He was pulling so hard for me to win
and that's a nice feeling.

189
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:08,451
When I holed that putt he walked across
the green with a million people watching

190
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:14,289
<i>and he put his arm around me and he said:
"Got it. You reached me to win Masters."</i>

191
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:19,691
Broadcaster: And here's the pride of
Europe, Severiano Ballesteros.

192
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:22,810
Number seventeen, from about fifteen feet.

193
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:26,610
(applause)

194
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:30,162
Broadcaster:
Olé, and all is well with the world!

195
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:35,048
This for a sixty-eight
and a seven stroke lead once again.

196
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:38,682
And there it is, one more time!

197
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:41,810
The magic touch of a man, who not many years ago,

198
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,367
owned little more than an old three iron

199
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:48,525
and the certainty that some day,
he'd become a champion at this game.

200
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:53,929
And there it is.
Comfortably parring number 16 and 17.

201
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:56,651
And here, triumphantly, number 18,

202
00:24:56,800 --> 00:25:01,840
Seve Ballesteros, 23 years and four days
old, of Santander, Spain,

203
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,482
played one third of the 72 holes under par.

204
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:09,565
A record, to become both
the youngest winner of the Masters

205
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:12,041
and the first from Europe.

206
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:15,010
Son of a farmer, youngest of four brothers

207
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:18,329
and still living in the house where he was born.

208
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:20,770
Severiano Ballesteros!

209
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:22,888
(applause)

210
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:25,651
Broadcaster: The 1980 Masters champion!

211
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:29,607
Olé indeed.

212
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:35,122
His agent, Ed Barnard told us
that he had been at a luncheon

213
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:39,683
and he, the agent,
was introduced by the toast-master

214
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:45,404
as the manager of professional golfer
Ballerina Sevasteros.

215
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:49,566
<i>Announcer:
The</i> winner <i>of the forty-fourth Masters...</i>

216
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:53,566
Broadcaster: They butchered his name
a week ago, but no longer.

217
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:57,122
When you win the Masters, they get your name fight.

218
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:04,891
Father:

219
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:08,091
Mother:

220
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:10,044
- Hola, mama'.
- Hola, hijo.

221
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:11,725
Hula, papa'.

222
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:53,322
(scrubbing)

223
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:48,131
<i>Seve: Because I was the smallest, I used
to do ab' the dirty work for everybody.</i>

224
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:54,208
I remember I used to clean up the shoes on Sunday morning

225
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:57,927
and they used to give me five pesetas.

226
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:03,882
(piano and string music)

227
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:14,686
Brother:

228
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:30,526
Seve:

229
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:37,040
Brother:

230
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:22,201
Seve: I started to caddy when I was nine.
At the beginning it was very good.

231
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:40,405
Seve: But I think it's a little boring
to carry a golf bag to a very bad golfer.

232
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:46,124
Because they go left, right, you have to
try and find the ball. It's very boring.

233
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:52,286
But as soon as I started practicing I enjoyed it very much

234
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:58,049
and every time the members didn't see me,
I'd hit the ball or make a few swings.

235
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:33,608
(chuckles)

236
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:47,721
(hit)

237
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:04,969
Seve: I played at night when it was dark.
Nobody saw me. On the beach.

238
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:13,526
Maybe the strict rules helped me because
I was more anxious and hungry to practice.

239
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:17,922
And the more difficult the thing, the more you try.

240
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:23,006
(hit)

241
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:25,482
(applause fades in)

242
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:30,168
Broadcaster: And what a finish!
What a grandstand finish yet again!

243
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:32,727
Are you aware of the noise of the crowd

244
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:36,521
when you concentrate on
the last hole of such a tournament?

245
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:40,765
Seve: No. If your concentration is good,
you don't hear anything.

246
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:42,485
Nothing worries you.

247
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:47,328
But ff your concentration is not good,
even the ﬂies can bother you.

248
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:08,642
Seve: Golf has always been fun.

249
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:13,969
The good thing about golf is that when you play golf

250
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:18,370
you always produce one or two shots

251
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:21,364
that really make you feel good

252
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:28,050
and makes you think
"Oh, I think I'll come back tomorrow."

253
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:29,850
(applause)

254
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:35,010
(Splash)

255
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:45,247
(acoustic guitar music reprises)

256
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:55,530
Interviewer:
Were you a well-behaved kid, Seve?

257
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:58,047
Wife, I'd never get in any trouble. wife.

258
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:02,243
Well yes... one time I...

259
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:04,645
(laughs)

260
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:05,847
Teacher

261
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:44,170
(slaps)

262
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:54,010
(slams door)

263
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:58,090
(slow string music)

264
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:27,010
Mama'?

265
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:29,849
Papa?

266
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,526
Seve: My father and my mother were away.

267
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:40,404
There was a bottle of wine.

268
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:06,763
I drank a few glasses and I went back to school...

269
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:27,608
(slams door)

270
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:46,327
Mother:

271
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,525
Mother:

272
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:26,487
Father:

273
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:28,210
Mother:

274
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:58,410
Seve: This is the place in my house
where I used to practice when I was young.

275
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:01,609
Because sometimes there's bad weather here.

276
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:07,487
And I didn't have any other place to practice.

277
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:10,211
Interviewer: You used to have a net there?

278
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:14,649
Yes. Now I don't know where it is,
but I used to put it up here.

279
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:18,207
(acoustic guitar music reprises)

280
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:56,242
Mother:

281
00:37:56,400 --> 00:38:00,166
Seve: I used to practice at twelve,
one o'clock at night.

282
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:05,284
My mother used to come down many times
and say: "Come up and go to sleep.

283
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:07,681
What are you doing here?
You're crazy!"

284
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:10,170
(sighs)

285
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:12,971
It was good... a good place to practice.

286
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:20,646
(people talking)

287
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:55,282
Seve: I used to wait for the guard
and the caddy masters

288
00:38:55,880 --> 00:39:01,171
and the guy from the locker room to go by
to make sure that everything was clear.

289
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:06,042
Once they went through...
I jumped.

290
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:16,602
(grunts) (laughs)

291
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:20,482
(upbeat music reprises)

292
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:29,930
(applause fades in)

293
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:35,041
Broadcaster: When you've got it--
you've got it! What a magnificent touch.

294
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:50,769
(crowd cheers)

295
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:05,001
(crowd cheers)

296
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:11,602
(inaudible cheers)

297
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:16,282
(applause)

298
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:23,882
Broadcaster: Ladies and gentlemen, the
greatest golfer in the world!

299
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:25,610
Severiano Ballesteros!

300
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:27,683
(music fades out)

301
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:45,682
(moving)

302
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:53,560
Father: Vamos a casa, chicas, vamos.

303
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:56,882
(moving)

304
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:49,008
(acoustic guitar music)

305
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:50,207
Doctor:

306
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:15,124
When he stepped up to the ball, we knew
something exciting was going to happen.

307
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:17,410
(hit)

308
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:20,322
He was so aggressive in his drive.

309
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:22,767
If there was a green over there at 3-20,

310
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:28,131
he'd hit it 300 yards through the air
which was pretty impressive in that era.

311
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:40,808
Seve: I took more risks than most people,
but that is my way.

312
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:47,601
Nick Faldo: The way he played shots,

313
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:50,240
and the way he swung the club,

314
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:52,482
was beautiful.

315
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:57,362
Ben Crenshaw: He had one of the most
beautiful set-ups I have ever seen.

316
00:43:58,760 --> 00:44:01,366
He had a style all of his own.

317
00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:07,365
He could get it up and down from the trashcan.

318
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:11,605
From the garage. From the car park.
You name it, he can do it.

319
00:44:13,720 --> 00:44:18,282
Ben Crenshaw: But his shod shots were
just something to behold.

320
00:44:18,440 --> 00:44:22,490
What a wonderful touch he had with
his hands and how creative he was.

321
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:27,686
He was more like an artist painting
on a beautiful canvas around the green.

322
00:44:27,840 --> 00:44:30,969
Seve: It's something
that is very hard to describe.

323
00:44:31,120 --> 00:44:34,522
This feeling I have.
You feel it and you think about that.

324
00:44:34,680 --> 00:44:37,445
You visualize that and you feel it inside.

325
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:39,125
And then you do it”.

326
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:42,811
There's no secret. This is the way it is.

327
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:49,370
Man: Muy bien.

328
00:44:50,080 --> 00:44:52,242
Seve:

329
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:07,962
(cheering fades in)

330
00:45:08,120 --> 00:45:11,841
Certain people in life have this little aura around them.

331
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,731
Sinatra had it.
Elvis Presley had it.

332
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:18,248
Geordie Best had it.
And he had it. It just oozed from him.

333
00:45:19,840 --> 00:45:23,242
Everywhere he went, there was just this trail of people.

334
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:24,925
"Have you seen Seve?"

335
00:45:25,080 --> 00:45:29,881
He was like a film star--
"Have you seen the latest Clint Eastwood movie?"

336
00:45:30,080 --> 00:45:32,208
He had that something about him.

337
00:45:33,880 --> 00:45:38,442
Seve: The only thing that at first
made me a bit worried is the attention

338
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:42,207
that was created very quickly from the media

339
00:45:42,360 --> 00:45:48,163
and from being a nobody to becoming
a superstar in just a few days, you know.

340
00:45:49,240 --> 00:45:51,891
My freedom disappeared.

341
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:55,810
Especially in the UK.

342
00:45:58,520 --> 00:46:00,648
I was so popular.

343
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:06,091
Broadcaster: This young Ballesteros
has suddenly become the crowd's hero.

344
00:46:06,280 --> 00:46:10,251
Peter Allies: The British public
absolutely loved him,

345
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:14,166
his style, his charisma, his looks and everything.

346
00:46:14,320 --> 00:46:15,845
And he loved them.

347
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:21,282
Guys, if you don't mind please.
I know you're nervous but I am too, okay.

348
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:23,010
(they laugh)

349
00:46:23,160 --> 00:46:25,891
Broadcaster:
A little movement in the crowd.

350
00:46:29,480 --> 00:46:31,608
(crowd laughs and claps)

351
00:46:32,520 --> 00:46:36,730
Broadcaster: I think he saw that guy
as he popped it back inside there.

352
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:40,043
When Seve turned around and:
"Nope. Not me. No."

353
00:46:40,920 --> 00:46:42,490
Lovely.

354
00:46:43,360 --> 00:46:47,285
Seve: I have to do nearly everything
in my room in the hotel.

355
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:51,604
And that was tough for a young man
like me, you know. Very tough.

356
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:57,365
But that was the price of the success.

357
00:47:01,560 --> 00:47:03,767
(hit)

358
00:47:04,520 --> 00:47:06,648
(cows moo)

359
00:47:45,240 --> 00:47:46,890
(cow moos)

360
00:47:47,960 --> 00:47:49,769
(hit)

361
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:54,164
(cow moos)

362
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:07,571
(acoustic guitar music reprises)

363
00:48:07,720 --> 00:48:12,408
Broadcaster: There's certainly no
holding back over these finishing holes.

364
00:48:12,560 --> 00:48:17,805
He's just lashing at the bail with every
ounce of power in his substantial body.

365
00:48:19,560 --> 00:48:21,130
Number two. Par five.

366
00:48:24,200 --> 00:48:26,282
(applause)

367
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:37,525
(crowd cheering)

368
00:48:37,720 --> 00:48:40,929
Broadcaster: Well done.
Slam bam! Birdie. Eagle.

369
00:48:41,080 --> 00:48:43,560
And suddenly, after being a shot astray,

370
00:48:43,720 --> 00:48:47,486
Seve Ballesteros is leading the Masters by two strokes.

371
00:48:50,320 --> 00:48:51,845
(hit)

372
00:48:54,440 --> 00:48:58,365
Broadcaster: And isn't this just
the most unbelievable golf?

373
00:49:02,600 --> 00:49:05,251
And it looks absolutely dead on the pin.

374
00:49:07,880 --> 00:49:10,247
Oh my goodness gracious!

375
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:15,167
Where does a man get the moxy to hit
a shot like that at a moment like this?

376
00:49:15,320 --> 00:49:17,402
(applause)

377
00:49:21,560 --> 00:49:25,565
Seve: Because the Americans
always believed until later on

378
00:49:25,720 --> 00:49:29,725
that it was not possible
for any European to win the Masters,

379
00:49:29,880 --> 00:49:33,441
it makes me feel very happy and very proud.

380
00:49:33,600 --> 00:49:36,490
(crowd cheering)

381
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:41,810
Broadcaster: I guess it was meant for him
to be the champion.

382
00:49:43,360 --> 00:49:48,002
When he went to Augusta,
he broke some barriers for us, certainly.

383
00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:52,245
After him winning, it spurred on an
incredible European run.

384
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:58,201
Seve: You're supposed to wear
the green jacket only during the Masters.

385
00:49:59,240 --> 00:50:00,810
(applause)

386
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:05,761
Broadcaster: Severiano Ballesteros,
the 1983 Masters Champion.

387
00:50:08,120 --> 00:50:11,966
I took it home and... don't tell anybody,
ifs in my house.

388
00:50:12,120 --> 00:50:15,488
This is a replica, okay?
You understand?

389
00:50:16,440 --> 00:50:18,522
(chugging)

390
00:50:20,360 --> 00:50:22,442
(TV noise in the background)

391
00:50:31,640 --> 00:50:35,486
(film music: Finale of the
William Tell Overture by Rossini)

392
00:50:58,040 --> 00:50:59,326
Rafa:

393
00:50:59,480 --> 00:51:00,527
Seve:

394
00:51:09,360 --> 00:51:10,521
Seve:

395
00:51:17,520 --> 00:51:21,570
Seve: What really gives
you the perception of the distance

396
00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:24,730
and the feel, is if you swing and you close your eyes.

397
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:26,325
Seve:

398
00:51:30,920 --> 00:51:32,490
(hit)

399
00:51:34,760 --> 00:51:36,330
(hit)

400
00:51:48,040 --> 00:51:51,761
Seve: You can really know
which way the ball goes.

401
00:51:51,960 --> 00:51:55,567
Not only by sound, but also by feel.

402
00:51:55,720 --> 00:51:57,290
(hit)

403
00:51:57,440 --> 00:51:59,124
Seve: That helps.

404
00:52:18,840 --> 00:52:19,887
Rafa:

405
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:23,891
Seve:

406
00:52:28,520 --> 00:52:30,602
Seve: First, you need the ability.

407
00:52:30,760 --> 00:52:34,048
But I think the mental side is very important, too.

408
00:52:35,800 --> 00:52:39,566
You have to be cool.
You have to be very powerful.

409
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:45,806
You have to be convinced
that you have a great chance to win.

410
00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:56,686
Seve: You can lose, but it must never
cross your mind. Always winning.

411
00:52:56,840 --> 00:53:00,890
<i>It's very important to keep
your face down. Don't took around.</i>

412
00:53:01,040 --> 00:53:04,931
Don't ever put your face up.
Talk as little as you can.

413
00:53:05,960 --> 00:53:09,407
And just put your eyes with your ball and the hole.

414
00:53:12,320 --> 00:53:16,962
Man: He wouldn't exchange too many
pleasantries when he was playing.

415
00:53:17,120 --> 00:53:18,770
Obviously he was out to win.

416
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:22,567
A great champ is not concerned with anyone else.

417
00:53:22,760 --> 00:53:28,324
Broadcaster: Now Ballesteros--
I'm sure we're going to see a savage smash.

418
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:32,565
Just look out, ball.
You don't know what you're in for...

419
00:53:32,720 --> 00:53:35,326
(hits)

420
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:37,602
Broadcaster: I say' "Take that!"

421
00:53:42,080 --> 00:53:43,650
Seve: Mierda!

422
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:46,926
Broadcaster:
He may be slightly cross...

423
00:53:47,080 --> 00:53:49,481
Those cold, black eyes are burning.

424
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,128
(swears in Spanish)

425
00:53:55,560 --> 00:54:00,521
Seve: You never know what is going to
happen with me on each hole.

426
00:54:01,480 --> 00:54:03,767
Rafa:

427
00:54:05,840 --> 00:54:08,889
(rhythmic acoustic guitar music)

428
00:54:09,040 --> 00:54:13,011
Broadcaster: We have found Seve's ball,
but he really is in a dreadful position.

429
00:54:13,160 --> 00:54:15,686
He's right in the middle of that willow scrub.

430
00:54:15,840 --> 00:54:17,365
Move back, please.

431
00:54:19,240 --> 00:54:21,811
Seve: No, I'm not a very steady player.

432
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:26,805
Move back, please.

433
00:54:27,680 --> 00:54:32,481
Seve: The people like to see troubled
shots in the trees and the bunkers,

434
00:54:32,640 --> 00:54:36,281
and see me make bogies,
double-bogies, you know.

435
00:54:36,440 --> 00:54:41,401
<i>But I think one day I hit all my drives
straight to the fairway</i>

436
00:54:41,560 --> 00:54:44,723
The people will have lost a lot of golf probably.

437
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:52,129
<i>I always say that every time that I go to the rough,</i>

438
00:54:52,280 --> 00:54:54,601
many times I can swing the club.

439
00:54:55,680 --> 00:54:59,162
I always believe that there is always a shot somewhere.

440
00:54:59,320 --> 00:55:01,448
(hit) (applause)

441
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:20,045
Seve: I've always been
very hard on myself,

442
00:55:20,200 --> 00:55:23,204
even when I fumed professional in my early days.

443
00:55:25,080 --> 00:55:28,721
Seve: When I was having a bad day,
I would say to myself:

444
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:32,327
<i>"Today you didn't do a good job, you didn't play well,</i>

445
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:37,168
so you don't deserve to have dinner."
So I went to bed without having dinner.

446
00:55:38,560 --> 00:55:41,166
That's one way to be hard on yourself...

447
00:55:41,320 --> 00:55:43,448
(hit) (Sighs)

448
00:55:43,600 --> 00:55:48,322
Broadcaster: When he was in the doldrums,
nobody could have looked sadder.

449
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:52,849
You wanted to cuddle him and take him home
and let Mom make him tea.

450
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:57,210
Seve: When I play bad,
I feel bad not only for myself

451
00:55:57,360 --> 00:56:00,682
I feel very bad for the people who've come to watch.

452
00:56:02,720 --> 00:56:06,202
When you start having some kind of failure,

453
00:56:06,360 --> 00:56:10,570
that's when you start getting tight and you get worried.

454
00:56:10,760 --> 00:56:16,324
And it's like "I don't want to miss the
putt", not "I want to make the putt".

455
00:56:16,480 --> 00:56:22,010
Broadcaster: That's on line--
has it got the legs? Oh no, caramba.

456
00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:24,845
Another Spanish cries.

457
00:56:26,160 --> 00:56:28,242
Sever It's all in the mind.

458
00:56:49,400 --> 00:56:51,641
(rhythmic music)

459
00:57:02,480 --> 00:57:03,561
Rafa:
Seve:

460
00:57:04,360 --> 00:57:08,001
Rafa:

461
00:57:26,120 --> 00:57:29,203
Rafa:

462
00:57:31,400 --> 00:57:32,447
Seve:

463
00:57:43,800 --> 00:57:48,249
Seve: When I have my three iron,
this is how I create all these shots.

464
00:57:49,400 --> 00:57:53,086
And all the ideas develop
In your imagination when you play.

465
00:57:54,560 --> 00:57:57,689
That's why I am always very sharp and very quick

466
00:57:57,840 --> 00:58:03,847
in finding out the way to escape
to produce those miracle shots.

467
00:58:07,080 --> 00:58:09,162
(music becomes more rhythmic)

468
00:58:26,480 --> 00:58:30,041
(hit)

469
00:58:31,040 --> 00:58:32,610
(applause)

470
00:58:32,760 --> 00:58:35,889
Broadcaster:
He still has magic in his hands...

471
00:58:36,040 --> 00:58:38,088
Rafa:

472
00:58:38,280 --> 00:58:39,441
Seve:

473
00:58:47,720 --> 00:58:48,767
(hit)

474
00:58:49,840 --> 00:58:51,410
(hit)

475
00:58:59,560 --> 00:59:00,104
Brother:

476
00:59:11,400 --> 00:59:12,925
Yeah!

477
00:59:25,240 --> 00:59:26,765
(music builds up)

478
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:34,926
Broadcaster: In she goes! 65 strokes!
Seve is the champion.

479
00:59:36,120 --> 00:59:38,487
(applause)

480
00:59:55,880 --> 00:59:58,201
(applause)

481
01:00:25,520 --> 01:00:27,648
(family members toast)

482
01:00:31,800 --> 01:00:33,882
(family chatting)

483
01:00:37,120 --> 01:00:39,930
Seve:

484
01:00:40,080 --> 01:00:41,320
Brother:

485
01:01:45,600 --> 01:01:47,921
(soft piano music)

486
01:01:49,120 --> 01:01:50,963
Father:

487
01:01:58,520 --> 01:02:03,208
Seve: To have success wherever
you play golf or do any other thing,

488
01:02:03,400 --> 01:02:06,324
there are two things you need.

489
01:02:06,480 --> 01:02:10,246
<i>You have to work very hard--</i>
<i>that's number one.</i>

490
01:02:10,400 --> 01:02:14,405
And number two, you need a tremendous amount of discipline.

491
01:02:17,080 --> 01:02:20,721
Discipline is the key in life.
For many things.

492
01:02:21,400 --> 01:02:22,970
(hit)

493
01:02:24,360 --> 01:02:30,163
Seve: You have to take care of yourself.
You have to sleep eight hours every day.

494
01:02:30,320 --> 01:02:35,247
And practice-- I go to the driving range
many times when I don't feel like it.

495
01:02:36,880 --> 01:02:40,965
You know what will be the best thing
for me for how I feel at the moment?

496
01:02:41,120 --> 01:02:43,088
I'd like to go to the hotel.

497
01:02:43,240 --> 01:02:47,723
My boy is there and I would like to be
there and play with my boy.

498
01:02:47,880 --> 01:02:51,009
But do you know what?
Lam going to the driving range.

499
01:02:51,960 --> 01:02:56,090
Because I know that tomorrow is a big day
and I wan! to be ready.

500
01:02:57,440 --> 01:02:59,044
That's the profession.

501
01:03:01,640 --> 01:03:03,210
(hit)

502
01:03:06,920 --> 01:03:08,445
(hit)

503
01:03:09,200 --> 01:03:12,647
Broadcaster: Touch of class, baby.
Touch of class.

504
01:03:14,400 --> 01:03:16,528
(applause)

505
01:03:20,280 --> 01:03:23,045
<i>Seve: Winning the Open is very difficult.</i>

506
01:03:24,120 --> 01:03:28,409
Winning the Open at Si. Andrews
was something very, very special.

507
01:03:28,560 --> 01:03:32,087
<i>Because St. Andrews is the home of golf,
and St. Andrews is...</i>

508
01:03:32,280 --> 01:03:36,251
is a different type of golf course.
It's a piece of art.

509
01:03:36,400 --> 01:03:40,325
Broadcaster: What a situation; Watson with
a putt for a birdie at the 13th,

510
01:03:40,480 --> 01:03:43,768
Ballesteros with a putt for a birdie at the 14th.

511
01:03:43,960 --> 01:03:45,485
Watson first.

512
01:03:50,120 --> 01:03:52,202
(crowd cheering)

513
01:03:53,200 --> 01:03:56,727
Broadcaster:
This would put him in a tie for the lead.

514
01:03:58,440 --> 01:04:01,046
Oh touché! (crowd cheering)

515
01:04:01,200 --> 01:04:07,162
Would you credit it. Two putts.
Two birdies. Still tied at 11 under par.

516
01:04:08,760 --> 01:04:11,047
Ballesteros, second and seventeen.

517
01:04:11,240 --> 01:04:12,765
(hit)

518
01:04:17,960 --> 01:04:20,406
(crowd starting to cheer)

519
01:04:20,560 --> 01:04:24,724
Broadcaster: Whoa whoa whoa,
that's a marvellous shot.

520
01:04:24,920 --> 01:04:27,002
(applause)

521
01:04:27,840 --> 01:04:30,127
Broadcaster: Back on the 17th tee.

522
01:04:31,760 --> 01:04:32,807
(hit)

523
01:04:33,720 --> 01:04:37,930
Broadcaster: And he sent that off on the
perfect line.

524
01:04:41,520 --> 01:04:43,045
Very brave.

525
01:04:43,200 --> 01:04:44,770
(applause)

526
01:04:49,920 --> 01:04:52,924
Broadcaster: Seve for a three at 17.

527
01:04:55,280 --> 01:04:56,805
It's not tied yet.

528
01:04:58,120 --> 01:05:00,202
(applause)

529
01:05:04,840 --> 01:05:06,968
Broadcaster: That's the four.

530
01:05:09,600 --> 01:05:12,729
Watson in the ideal spot down the 17th.

531
01:05:12,880 --> 01:05:17,090
Seve's already played the hole, got a 4.
So much can happen on the 17th.

532
01:05:19,800 --> 01:05:21,325
Oh...

533
01:05:21,520 --> 01:05:23,045
(crowd groans)

534
01:05:24,560 --> 01:05:27,484
Broadcaster: Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear...

535
01:05:27,640 --> 01:05:30,211
Well, they did say it wasn't all over yet...

536
01:05:30,400 --> 01:05:33,449
That really was an extraordinary shot from Tom.

537
01:05:33,600 --> 01:05:36,809
Seve's second shot to the final hole.

538
01:05:38,640 --> 01:05:40,210
(hit)

539
01:05:40,360 --> 01:05:42,249
Broadcaster: The dust ﬂies.

540
01:05:43,800 --> 01:05:44,847
(crowd cheers)

541
01:05:45,040 --> 01:05:47,281
<i>Broadcaster: What a little sweetie!</i>

542
01:05:50,200 --> 01:05:53,921
Seve lining up a short-ish putt.

543
01:05:55,160 --> 01:05:56,730
This is for a 3.

544
01:05:57,800 --> 01:06:00,167
And he's just got his hole!

545
01:06:00,320 --> 01:06:02,163
(crowd is cheering loudly)

546
01:06:06,840 --> 01:06:09,810
Broadcaster:
You think he enjoyed that one?

547
01:06:11,840 --> 01:06:13,763
Go on, give him a kiss as well.

548
01:06:15,120 --> 01:06:16,804
That's fantastic stuff'.

549
01:06:23,400 --> 01:06:27,769
This is St. Andrews, '84.
The best moment of my career,

550
01:06:27,960 --> 01:06:31,851
so I thought that it was a good idea
to stamp that forever in my arm.

551
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:35,368
Just there. Remember, Seve.
You're the best.

552
01:06:35,520 --> 01:06:37,602
(applause)

553
01:06:40,760 --> 01:06:42,888
(applause becomes louder)

554
01:06:48,880 --> 01:06:53,408
Seve: This is for my mother, who has come
to the Open for the first time.

555
01:06:53,560 --> 01:06:56,530
She is around here, I don't know...
somewhere.

556
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:00,082
(upbeat mandolin music)

557
01:07:05,600 --> 01:07:07,682
(cries of seagulls)

558
01:07:29,040 --> 01:07:30,724
Brother:

559
01:07:52,120 --> 01:07:53,167
Seve:

560
01:08:11,160 --> 01:08:16,200
Interviewer: What are the ambitions you
have in life generally, away from golf?

561
01:08:16,400 --> 01:08:20,928
Seve: I don't know... I've been
only thinking about golf. That's it.

562
01:08:22,560 --> 01:08:25,211
Interviewer: Do you have a girlfriend?
- No.

563
01:08:25,960 --> 01:08:30,124
Many. I have many.
But no steady one.

564
01:08:31,080 --> 01:08:32,605
(hit)

565
01:08:32,760 --> 01:08:37,482
He's so golf-orientated that all he does
is just play golf, golf, golf...

566
01:08:37,640 --> 01:08:42,680
I think if I was Seve, I'd go out
to a few discotheques now and again

567
01:08:42,840 --> 01:08:45,286
and have a bit of fun, let yourself go.

568
01:08:48,240 --> 01:08:53,804
Interviewer: A lot of people would say,
I'd like to be married and have a family.

569
01:08:53,960 --> 01:08:57,203
Well probably, yeah. Good idea.

570
01:08:58,480 --> 01:09:04,522
He had those wonderful smouldering looks
that sent many pulses racing, I tell you.

571
01:09:04,680 --> 01:09:10,483
But he was a canny lad. And he married
his childhood sweetheart, Carmen.

572
01:09:10,640 --> 01:09:12,802
She was his golfing pupil.

573
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:16,686
And they became man and wife
and had three children together.

574
01:09:45,480 --> 01:09:47,881
(soft guitar music)

575
01:11:26,400 --> 01:11:30,450
Brother:

576
01:11:30,600 --> 01:11:32,762
Seve:

577
01:11:32,920 --> 01:11:34,445
Brother:

578
01:11:34,640 --> 01:11:37,325
Brian Moore:
The story of Severiano Ballesteros

579
01:11:37,520 --> 01:11:40,444
is about a young Spaniard from a humble background

580
01:11:40,600 --> 01:11:43,809
who has become one of the most controversial golf players

581
01:11:43,960 --> 01:11:46,042
and an attraction for so many girls

582
01:11:46,200 --> 01:11:48,726
in golf galleries around the world.

583
01:11:48,880 --> 01:11:51,167
But he's most in the news these days

584
01:11:51,320 --> 01:11:54,688
through his demands for appearance money when he plays,

585
01:11:54,840 --> 01:11:59,562
at a time when golf organizers are seeking
to stop this son of payment.

586
01:12:00,320 --> 01:12:05,087
Seve: When you go to the golf course,
who are you going to watch?

587
01:12:06,040 --> 01:12:07,883
The best players, isn't it.

588
01:12:08,040 --> 01:12:09,565
(cheering)

589
01:12:09,760 --> 01:12:14,049
The best players bring the TV and
give the prestige to the tournament.

590
01:12:14,200 --> 01:12:17,329
And the best players bring the people to watch.

591
01:12:18,360 --> 01:12:24,003
If the sponsors want the best players,
they have to pay them. That's it.

592
01:12:24,160 --> 01:12:26,845
Interviewer:
But hasn't golf given you a lot else?

593
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:29,207
Do you know how much I give to golf?

594
01:12:30,040 --> 01:12:34,250
I started when I was nine.
And since then...

595
01:12:34,400 --> 01:12:37,961
I live until right now, twenty-three.

596
01:12:39,200 --> 01:12:44,206
This way. All for golf.
You think this is not enough?

597
01:12:46,240 --> 01:12:49,084
I think it's enough.
- Interviewer: Your life.

598
01:12:49,240 --> 01:12:53,370
All my life. And life is more important
than anything else, right?

599
01:12:53,520 --> 01:12:55,648
So golf owes me something.

600
01:12:56,880 --> 01:13:01,124
Or maybe we're even--
but I don't owe anything to golf.

601
01:14:22,760 --> 01:14:24,842
(ﬂute music)

602
01:14:47,680 --> 01:14:49,762
(cows moo)

603
01:15:15,920 --> 01:15:17,490
Father: Ho, ho!

604
01:15:20,840 --> 01:15:22,922
(music fades out)

605
01:15:23,120 --> 01:15:25,441
Man:

606
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:35,081
(laughs)

607
01:16:38,640 --> 01:16:41,928
Brother: (Spanish)

608
01:17:01,720 --> 01:17:03,802
(murmuring) (chatting)

609
01:17:23,120 --> 01:17:25,248
(applause)

610
01:17:32,680 --> 01:17:34,250
All: Seve! Seve!

611
01:17:45,440 --> 01:17:48,887
As we were going out on the last day, Seve said:

612
01:17:49,040 --> 01:17:51,850
"The one with the biggest heart will win,"

613
01:17:52,720 --> 01:17:55,451
<i>I thought, well, you mean you, don't you.</i>

614
01:17:57,080 --> 01:17:59,162
(piano music)

615
01:18:04,040 --> 01:18:05,326
(hit)

616
01:18:05,480 --> 01:18:07,562
(music becomes more rhythmic)

617
01:18:15,360 --> 01:18:17,647
(acoustic guitar joins in)

618
01:18:22,840 --> 01:18:23,887
(hit)

619
01:18:30,840 --> 01:18:33,446
Broadcaster: Well, that is pure magic.

620
01:18:35,240 --> 01:18:40,610
Seve: When I walk into the ball
and I see the line and I see the shot,

621
01:18:40,760 --> 01:18:45,482
it was very difficult if I say, okay,
let's play one of those shots

622
01:18:45,640 --> 01:18:47,768
that you did when you were young.

623
01:18:47,920 --> 01:18:50,321
(applause)

624
01:18:50,480 --> 01:18:52,448
Broadcaster: A touch of genius!

625
01:18:53,800 --> 01:18:54,847
(hit)

626
01:19:00,240 --> 01:19:03,130
Seve: From the background
I would have nothing.

627
01:19:03,280 --> 01:19:06,887
Remember, I had no balls. No clubs.
No money, nothing.

628
01:19:07,040 --> 01:19:11,443
I used to make bets without having any
pennies in my pocket.

629
01:19:14,640 --> 01:19:17,371
I had no choice. I had to win somehow.

630
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:22,561
So obviously I became a tremendous competitor.

631
01:19:25,520 --> 01:19:27,921
Dave Musgrove:
If somebody's playing good,

632
01:19:28,080 --> 01:19:32,768
we say: he obviously has no money
because he can't afford to lose.

633
01:19:32,920 --> 01:19:37,687
That was Seve's attitude. He had no money.
Every week. And he expects to win.

634
01:20:03,120 --> 01:20:06,681
Dave Musgrove: If you caddied for him
for a while, you knew

635
01:20:06,840 --> 01:20:09,730
he could simply handle anything and anybody.

636
01:20:09,880 --> 01:20:13,566
<i>People thought it was a prestigious position...</i>
<i>But it wasn't.</i>

637
01:20:13,720 --> 01:20:17,281
He made us realize that all day and every day.

638
01:20:20,160 --> 01:20:22,766
After he won the Open, the next time I saw him

639
01:20:22,960 --> 01:20:25,645
he handed me a list of things I had done wrong.

640
01:20:43,880 --> 01:20:47,327
Dave Musgrove: "Run after the ball!"
Over the hill.

641
01:20:47,480 --> 01:20:50,848
When I got there he'd go:
"Where have you been?"

642
01:20:54,160 --> 01:20:56,003
He never rested on his laurels.

643
01:20:56,200 --> 01:21:00,569
Maybe because he's the youngest of four,
and he always had to prove himself.

644
01:21:00,720 --> 01:21:02,290
(hit)

645
01:21:15,240 --> 01:21:18,244
Seve: I control my emotions really well.

646
01:21:18,400 --> 01:21:21,165
That always has been my strongest point.

647
01:21:25,960 --> 01:21:30,807
It's part of the game. If you cannot
control your emotions, you cannot play.

648
01:21:40,560 --> 01:21:42,210
(Silent)

649
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:14,721
Seve: I say to myself,
this is your tournament.

650
01:22:14,880 --> 01:22:18,407
It may sound wife bit arrogant, but I expect to win.

651
01:22:23,480 --> 01:22:25,244
(all cheer)

652
01:22:25,400 --> 01:22:27,482
(applause)

653
01:22:27,640 --> 01:22:30,291
Brother: Congratulations, little brother!

654
01:22:32,240 --> 01:22:35,801
Seve: <i>When I play good I have so much fun
and so much pleasure</i>

655
01:22:35,960 --> 01:22:39,169
that there's no money in the world that can pay that.

656
01:22:56,560 --> 01:22:59,291
(music fades into slow string music)

657
01:23:41,600 --> 01:23:43,682
(festive music fades in)

658
01:23:59,920 --> 01:24:01,843
(Spanish)

659
01:24:31,720 --> 01:24:34,041
(crackling) (all cheer)

660
01:24:39,040 --> 01:24:41,122
(exploding)

661
01:24:55,400 --> 01:24:57,607
Seve:

662
01:24:57,760 --> 01:24:58,841
Rafa:

663
01:25:02,080 --> 01:25:04,242
Rafa: Come on, Seve!

664
01:25:08,560 --> 01:25:10,801
(shouting)

665
01:25:14,240 --> 01:25:16,322
BOY?

666
01:25:19,440 --> 01:25:20,680
Seve:

667
01:25:20,880 --> 01:25:23,804
Boys:

668
01:25:24,800 --> 01:25:26,006
(they laugh)

669
01:25:43,600 --> 01:25:44,647
(hit)

670
01:25:47,240 --> 01:25:48,287
Rafa:

671
01:26:25,080 --> 01:26:26,127
Mother:

672
01:26:31,360 --> 01:26:35,604
Seve: My father was always telling me
that I would be a good golfer

673
01:26:35,760 --> 01:26:41,210
and he always said "keep going, you look
great and you have the power.

674
01:26:41,360 --> 01:26:43,931
You'll be great and golf is very easy."

675
01:26:44,960 --> 01:26:47,804
He'd say those things.
And that helps.

676
01:26:49,320 --> 01:26:52,403
My mother tried to find me a job
- A safe job.

677
01:26:54,360 --> 01:26:57,443
Maybe go and work in a factory

678
01:26:57,600 --> 01:27:01,366
or maybe study and be a lawyer or something else.

679
01:27:01,520 --> 01:27:05,445
But a safe position, you know.

680
01:28:02,600 --> 01:28:03,886
Sergio:

681
01:28:19,560 --> 01:28:20,800
Father:

682
01:28:21,720 --> 01:28:24,883
Mother:

683
01:28:47,680 --> 01:28:50,729
Father:

684
01:29:09,920 --> 01:29:11,285
Father:

685
01:29:22,640 --> 01:29:24,369
Brother:

686
01:30:10,560 --> 01:30:11,800
Brother:

687
01:30:37,920 --> 01:30:41,129
Brother:

688
01:30:44,080 --> 01:30:46,287
(light-hearted music fades in)

689
01:30:49,160 --> 01:30:51,925
Broadcaster:
On a warm, wind/ass Sunday,

690
01:30:52,080 --> 01:30:55,323
four men arrive for one of golf's great finishes.

691
01:30:55,480 --> 01:30:57,562
(they greet each other)

692
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:06,607
Interviewer: How are you today?
- Pretty good, it's a beautiful day.

693
01:31:07,760 --> 01:31:10,809
Fan: We're pulling for you, Jack!
- Oh, thank you.

694
01:31:10,960 --> 01:31:12,769
- Fan: You play well!
- I'll try.

695
01:31:12,920 --> 01:31:17,528
Who do you think might win this Masters?
Would you pick a champion?

696
01:31:17,680 --> 01:31:22,402
I don't think you can ever win doing that
but Ballesteros will probably win

697
01:31:22,560 --> 01:31:25,848
because he is definitely the best player in the world.

698
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:33,766
Seve: This is one thing that I have.
I have it in my heart.

699
01:31:34,560 --> 01:31:36,210
(hit)

700
01:31:37,480 --> 01:31:41,530
Seve: Coming into the Masters,
I didn't have a chance to practice

701
01:31:41,720 --> 01:31:43,529
because my father was sick.

702
01:31:43,720 --> 01:31:46,451
Broadcaster: Here it comes!

703
01:31:48,360 --> 01:31:50,966
Seve: I did promise my father. I said:

704
01:31:51,120 --> 01:31:56,923
"I want you to come to the Masters because
this year I am going to win it for you."

705
01:31:58,800 --> 01:32:01,690
I never thought he was going to die so early.

706
01:32:03,480 --> 01:32:09,044
He passed away the 5th of March
and I went to play the Masters

707
01:32:09,200 --> 01:32:13,683
with only nine rounds of competition in six months.

708
01:32:16,920 --> 01:32:19,048
Broadcaster: Seve for an Eagle.

709
01:32:20,960 --> 01:32:24,203
What a moment. What a moment to do it.

710
01:32:24,360 --> 01:32:26,169
(applause)

711
01:32:30,560 --> 01:32:33,131
I'm standing in the middle of the field on the 15th,

712
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:37,002
and I hit a four onto the green.

713
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:40,287
(crowd cheering)

714
01:32:40,440 --> 01:32:44,968
Broadcaster: And he's got a chance.
He's got a very, very good chance

715
01:32:46,080 --> 01:32:49,801
of an Eagle three to make him seven under par.

716
01:32:51,520 --> 01:32:55,491
Yes, Sir!
And the old bear is back!

717
01:32:57,520 --> 01:33:01,047
<i>Jack Nicklaus, knowing he must continue the charge.</i>

718
01:33:01,200 --> 01:33:06,240
He has to figure that Ballesteros
will make at least Birdie back al fifteen.

719
01:33:06,400 --> 01:33:08,482
(applause)

720
01:33:11,800 --> 01:33:14,326
Oh my. And there's no doubt about it.

721
01:33:14,520 --> 01:33:18,161
The bear has come out of hibernation.

722
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:24,609
Obviously, Jack played fantastic
down the straights on the last five holes,

723
01:33:24,760 --> 01:33:28,890
but I was two shots ahead and I hit
a beautiful tee shot on the 15th.

724
01:33:29,080 --> 01:33:31,765
(cheering)

725
01:33:31,920 --> 01:33:34,321
Sever And I have to wait a little bit.

726
01:33:35,960 --> 01:33:38,486
He had the feeling that, until that point,

727
01:33:38,640 --> 01:33:43,202
it he really wanted to win something
he could dictate: I'm going to win this.

728
01:33:44,520 --> 01:33:48,127
The tournament will be over before the 16th this year.

729
01:33:48,920 --> 01:33:52,686
Interviewer: I don't need to ask how.
- My way. Of course.

730
01:33:56,600 --> 01:34:01,049
<i>Broadcaster: Right now, it is
Seve Ballesteros's Masters to lose.</i>

731
01:34:01,200 --> 01:34:03,328
(suspenseful music)

732
01:34:03,480 --> 01:34:05,005
(hit)

733
01:34:05,200 --> 01:34:08,602
Broadcaster: That was the worst shot
I've seen him hit...

734
01:34:09,960 --> 01:34:11,530
He got it in the water.

735
01:34:11,680 --> 01:34:15,366
He let go of the club. It looks like
something happened there.

736
01:34:15,520 --> 01:34:21,243
That's absolutely extraordinary. I don't
think We ever seen him hit such a shot.

737
01:34:21,400 --> 01:34:25,371
<i>Jack Nicklaus: He's on the 17th tee
and Seve hits it into the water.</i>

738
01:34:25,520 --> 01:34:29,081
And I heard the sound.
I knew exactly what it was.

739
01:34:29,240 --> 01:34:33,768
Because it was the sound of not cheering,
but some groaning...

740
01:34:35,400 --> 01:34:38,483
I guess that was the destiny for me--
not to win.

741
01:34:41,240 --> 01:34:42,969
Broadcaster: Maybe”.

742
01:34:43,120 --> 01:34:44,849
Yes, Sir!

743
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:47,446
(applause)

744
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:55,527
Seve: It was great,
the way Jack Nicklaus played.

745
01:34:57,560 --> 01:35:02,885
But the bitterness that I have inside my body

746
01:35:03,040 --> 01:35:05,327
because I didn't win for my father.

747
01:35:05,480 --> 01:35:08,006
(slow acoustic guitar music)

748
01:35:34,720 --> 01:35:38,281
Peter Allies: He was never
the same after that Masters.

749
01:35:38,440 --> 01:35:41,250
But being back at Lytham inspired him.

750
01:35:42,280 --> 01:35:43,850
How are you?

751
01:35:51,680 --> 01:35:54,081
The greatest I saw him play

752
01:35:54,240 --> 01:35:55,571
(hit)

753
01:35:55,720 --> 01:35:58,929
was that Monday when Pricey and I

754
01:35:59,080 --> 01:36:00,650
and Seve went oh'.

755
01:36:03,960 --> 01:36:06,611
Broadcaster: Now this could play in”.

756
01:36:07,440 --> 01:36:09,124
(applause)

757
01:36:09,320 --> 01:36:13,041
Broadcaster: He can'! see the bottom of
the ﬂag, so that's not bad.

758
01:36:13,240 --> 01:36:15,925
Nick Faldo: When you see a guy playing

759
01:36:16,120 --> 01:36:20,762
when they're just unbelievable.
And that was probably his finest day.

760
01:36:20,960 --> 01:36:22,724
(crowd cheers)

761
01:36:22,920 --> 01:36:26,402
Nick Faldo: That was the day
when he was the true Seve.

762
01:36:26,560 --> 01:36:29,643
He pieced together that round and I said to him:

763
01:36:29,840 --> 01:36:32,730
"That was the best round of golf
I've ever seen."

764
01:36:33,680 --> 01:36:37,526
Seve and! distanced ourselves
from the rest of the field

765
01:36:37,680 --> 01:36:41,730
toward the end of the front nine and we
played the last eleven holes,

766
01:36:41,880 --> 01:36:43,848
and one of us was going to win it.

767
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:49,166
Peter Allies: If you size up the guys
you're playing with and they're fidgety

768
01:36:49,360 --> 01:36:53,206
and some guys' eyes are darting all over the place...

769
01:36:53,360 --> 01:36:54,885
(crowd cheers)

770
01:36:55,040 --> 01:36:58,362
Broadcaster: Oh, I say. That was a killer.

771
01:36:59,080 --> 01:37:02,766
Peter Allies:
And Seve was just so focused that day.

772
01:37:03,640 --> 01:37:05,722
(applause)

773
01:37:08,720 --> 01:37:09,801
(hit)

774
01:37:14,880 --> 01:37:16,962
(applause)

775
01:37:18,320 --> 01:37:23,008
Broadcaster (chuckles):
What a fantastic stroke.

776
01:37:23,160 --> 01:37:24,730
(crowd cheers)

777
01:37:24,880 --> 01:37:27,451
(applause)

778
01:37:27,600 --> 01:37:31,685
Broadcaster:
Five Birdies and an Eagle in seven holes.

779
01:37:34,120 --> 01:37:35,201
(hit)

780
01:37:40,240 --> 01:37:41,765
(crowd cheers)

781
01:37:41,920 --> 01:37:43,763
Broadcaster: Oh, look at that.

782
01:37:45,120 --> 01:37:50,445
This hole is certainly one Seve
will remember all his life.

783
01:37:50,600 --> 01:37:52,170
(applause)

784
01:37:55,320 --> 01:37:59,006
Broadcaster: What a moment to produce a
stroke like that.

785
01:37:59,160 --> 01:38:01,640
Oh I bet his little heart is thumping.

786
01:38:02,240 --> 01:38:03,287
(hit)

787
01:38:04,560 --> 01:38:07,325
Broadcaster:
It looked to be a smooth rhythm.

788
01:38:09,600 --> 01:38:11,682
(crowd groans)

789
01:38:17,080 --> 01:38:22,610
Broadcaster: It's easy to slide the club
under the ball and not give it enough.

790
01:38:23,440 --> 01:38:27,001
Seve: I have the picture very clear,
so I went back

791
01:38:27,160 --> 01:38:30,960
took the sand wedge, took a couple of practice.

792
01:38:31,120 --> 01:38:34,090
Looked... and when I hit it,

793
01:38:34,240 --> 01:38:36,049
as soon as I hit it I saw the ball

794
01:38:36,200 --> 01:38:38,931
go up in the air and it was perfect.

795
01:38:39,080 --> 01:38:41,162
(crowd cheering)

796
01:38:50,840 --> 01:38:56,085
Broadcaster: In she goes. 65 strokes.
Seve is once more the champion.

797
01:38:57,120 --> 01:39:02,126
Nick Price: Most of us have twenty or
thirty different ways of shooting 65.

798
01:39:02,280 --> 01:39:06,444
Seve has 1500 ways of shooting 65.

799
01:39:06,600 --> 01:39:09,490
Seve: Well first of all,
I'd just like to say that

800
01:39:09,640 --> 01:39:13,804
it's a pity I didn't find any cars on the
sixteenth fairway this time.

801
01:39:13,960 --> 01:39:15,610
(all laugh)

802
01:39:15,800 --> 01:39:20,044
Unfortunately, you should park your cars
next time on the fairway.

803
01:39:20,200 --> 01:39:23,602
I'm becoming a very straight player now.

804
01:39:24,720 --> 01:39:27,246
I must say thanks to all you people

805
01:39:27,400 --> 01:39:32,645
because without your support I don't think
I'd be champion right now. Thank you.

806
01:39:32,800 --> 01:39:34,723
Announcer: Seve, thank you.

807
01:39:34,880 --> 01:39:36,962
(crowd cheering)

808
01:39:37,120 --> 01:39:41,569
<i>Peter Allies: We thought he's back,
but he didn't win another major.</i>

809
01:39:41,720 --> 01:39:45,088
But he was still a huge force for many years to come.

810
01:39:47,240 --> 01:39:51,529
The Ryder Cup was establish in 1927
as a bl-annual match

811
01:39:51,680 --> 01:39:54,570
between the British Isles and the USA.

812
01:39:54,720 --> 01:39:57,564
In 1979, the British team was reinforced

813
01:39:57,760 --> 01:40:01,003
with the finest golfers from continental Europe.

814
01:40:01,160 --> 01:40:05,051
But up until 1985,
the Americans had only lost three times.

815
01:40:05,200 --> 01:40:08,329
Then, things began to change.

816
01:40:09,760 --> 01:40:13,560
Tom Watson: The Ryder Cup was dying
and that would be his legacy

817
01:40:13,720 --> 01:40:17,691
in taking the Ryder Cup and turning it
around for the European team

818
01:40:17,840 --> 01:40:20,411
and making it the event it is today.

819
01:40:20,560 --> 01:40:22,244
(acoustic guitar music)

820
01:40:22,400 --> 01:40:26,246
He was Robin Hood.
And they were the wealthy sheriffs.

821
01:40:27,560 --> 01:40:31,167
Broadcaster:
If you're ever in a jam, here I am.

822
01:40:31,320 --> 01:40:35,245
Ken Brown: And he was going to show
the sheriffs how to play.

823
01:40:35,960 --> 01:40:38,201
Broadcaster: Thank you, partner.

824
01:40:38,360 --> 01:40:41,967
They're running out of holes.
There's only four more.

825
01:40:43,320 --> 01:40:47,484
It swings quite a way from there--
has it got the pace-- it has... ifs in!

826
01:40:47,680 --> 01:40:49,569
(applause)

827
01:40:50,880 --> 01:40:54,123
Broadcaster:
It's the magic we were waiting for.

828
01:40:54,280 --> 01:40:56,760
Onlooker: Get in! Get in!

829
01:40:56,920 --> 01:41:00,083
Broadcaster:
That's the second hole in a row he's won.

830
01:41:00,280 --> 01:41:01,805
Two Birdies...

831
01:41:01,960 --> 01:41:05,362
Ballesteros's brilliance needed here...

832
01:41:06,680 --> 01:41:08,648
And he's done it!

833
01:41:08,800 --> 01:41:13,124
A Birdie four, and he's leveled the march.

834
01:41:14,600 --> 01:41:16,967
Magic! Tremendous form!

835
01:41:17,120 --> 01:41:20,044
Ballesteros and Kite, a wonderful exhibition

836
01:41:20,200 --> 01:41:22,771
of straight playing and sportsmanship.

837
01:41:23,600 --> 01:41:26,001
These super professionals.

838
01:41:26,160 --> 01:41:30,290
It would be rather splendid
if Thomas could just roll this right in

839
01:41:30,440 --> 01:41:32,010
to win the Ryder Cup.

840
01:41:32,160 --> 01:41:34,811
(crowd cheering)

841
01:41:34,960 --> 01:41:37,042
(applause)

842
01:41:38,920 --> 01:41:41,651
I feel like I just won another British Open.

843
01:41:41,800 --> 01:41:47,330
I feel even better because I saw all the
people out there. This is fantastic.

844
01:41:49,160 --> 01:41:53,165
Seve: That Ryder Cup was really very
special for everybody

845
01:41:53,320 --> 01:41:56,130
because we beat the Americans.

846
01:41:56,280 --> 01:42:02,481
(crowd singing "For he's a Jolly Good Fellow")

847
01:42:08,160 --> 01:42:09,889
(all cheering)

848
01:42:12,120 --> 01:42:15,249
Broadcaster:
When Seve teamed up with Olazabal,

849
01:42:15,440 --> 01:42:19,764
they turned things Europe's way.
They were a very special partnership.

850
01:42:19,920 --> 01:42:24,767
They had complete trust in one another's
game and became virtually unbeatable.

851
01:42:24,920 --> 01:42:28,527
Announcer:
From Spain, José Maria Olazabal.

852
01:42:28,680 --> 01:42:32,526
Olazabal: In '87, when I was paired
with Severiano Ballesteros

853
01:42:32,680 --> 01:42:36,844
obviously I was very nervous, rocky.
It was my first Ryder Cup.

854
01:42:37,040 --> 01:42:40,010
I was walking towards the tee, and Seve came,

855
01:42:40,160 --> 01:42:44,449
<i>stood by my side;
he looked at me and said: "Jose,</i>

856
01:42:44,600 --> 01:42:47,968
you just play your game,
I will take care of the rest."

857
01:42:48,120 --> 01:42:50,930
And yes he did--
he did take care of the rest.

858
01:42:51,720 --> 01:42:55,930
Those Ryder Cup partnerships--
I don't think there's been any finer.

859
01:42:56,080 --> 01:43:00,369
Seve: We understand each other without
talking. Just by looking.

860
01:43:00,520 --> 01:43:06,562
And that's the reason why we've been
so successful in the Ryder Cup.

861
01:43:07,320 --> 01:43:10,563
Broadcaster: A smart idea
of Captain Anthony Jacklin

862
01:43:10,720 --> 01:43:15,123
to pair the older Spanish golfer
with the younger Spanish golfer.

863
01:43:17,200 --> 01:43:20,682
That's a good pairing.
I wouldn't break that team up.

864
01:43:21,360 --> 01:43:24,250
José just needs to get this out on the green.

865
01:43:25,120 --> 01:43:27,441
(crowd cheers)

866
01:43:27,600 --> 01:43:32,845
We only needed two putts on the 18th green
to tie the hole and win the match.

867
01:43:33,000 --> 01:43:36,243
Broadcaster: It looks okay...
now just a minute!

868
01:43:37,680 --> 01:43:39,808
Seve: I look at the ball
and I don't believe it.

869
01:43:39,960 --> 01:43:43,407
"Oh shit, that was really fast.
I can? believe it."

870
01:43:45,040 --> 01:43:49,011
Olazabal: <i>My god-- that's not
the putt I wanted to have.</i>

871
01:43:49,640 --> 01:43:54,567
Broadcaster: The thing he did not want
to do, is leave his young countryman here

872
01:43:54,720 --> 01:43:59,806
for the first time on this level,
with this putt to win the match.

873
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:02,924
Now this kid has to make it, or they lose the hole

874
01:44:03,080 --> 01:44:07,130
and only have the match and
they were three up for most of the day.

875
01:44:07,280 --> 01:44:10,090
Olazabal: He knew he put me
in a tough spot.

876
01:44:10,960 --> 01:44:17,002
Broadcaster: Okay. It's settled. And they
hang on to win the match. Another point.

877
01:44:17,160 --> 01:44:20,881
Olazabal: Once I made the putt,
I came back to him and I said:

878
01:44:21,040 --> 01:44:24,123
"don't you ever do that again to me,"

879
01:44:25,520 --> 01:44:27,409
Broadcaster: And there it was.

880
01:44:27,560 --> 01:44:31,770
Let history show that that was it,
to put them at fourteen ahead.

881
01:44:33,280 --> 01:44:36,568
Ballesteros has had an incredible week here.

882
01:44:36,720 --> 01:44:40,691
And the emotion is just building here for these Europeans.

883
01:44:42,400 --> 01:44:47,361
Seve: It was one of those moments that
give you faith for the rest of the day.

884
01:44:47,520 --> 01:44:49,602
(applause)

885
01:44:54,240 --> 01:44:55,287
(hit)

886
01:44:57,680 --> 01:45:01,765
Broadcaster: That's coming back on the
wind. Does he like it?

887
01:45:02,800 --> 01:45:04,325
Oh, I bet he does!

888
01:45:05,720 --> 01:45:09,691
<i>He was beginning to grin.
He couldn't quite hide the grin.</i>

889
01:45:09,840 --> 01:45:11,524
On, I say...

890
01:45:12,400 --> 01:45:13,447
(hit)

891
01:45:14,760 --> 01:45:16,330
Crowd: Ohh!

892
01:45:16,480 --> 01:45:19,484
Broadcaster: That started left.

893
01:45:19,640 --> 01:45:21,961
(broadcasters laugh) (crowd cheers)

894
01:45:22,120 --> 01:45:25,249
Broadcasters:
An almost embarrassment of riches.

895
01:45:25,400 --> 01:45:28,449
Olazabal: You might think
you are competitive,

896
01:45:28,600 --> 01:45:34,050
but when you play with Seve and you see
how he thinks and drives on the course...

897
01:45:34,200 --> 01:45:36,282
Broadcaster: Oh yeah, all the way.

898
01:45:36,440 --> 01:45:39,842
Olazabal:
You realize that he is at another level.

899
01:45:40,600 --> 01:45:44,127
He quickly got a reputation,
match-play wise,

900
01:45:44,280 --> 01:45:47,602
he didn't give an inch;
he was as rough as nails.

901
01:45:47,760 --> 01:45:50,923
Seve: You're switching
the compression on the team?

902
01:45:51,080 --> 01:45:52,809
- No.
- Yes, you did.

903
01:45:52,960 --> 01:45:56,442
Tony Jacklin: Being tough is part of
being a great player.

904
01:45:56,600 --> 01:45:59,251
And there was nobody tougher than Seve.

905
01:46:00,720 --> 01:46:03,371
Seve: I don't know-- we saw two balls.

906
01:46:03,520 --> 01:46:05,602
He played two different balls.

907
01:46:06,600 --> 01:46:12,642
Seve: There's no better feeling
or better taste than to be the best.

908
01:46:13,640 --> 01:46:15,688
You always want to be the best.

909
01:46:19,920 --> 01:46:23,367
Announcer:
Now please welcome Severiano Ballesteros.

910
01:46:23,560 --> 01:46:26,040
The captain of the European team.

911
01:46:26,200 --> 01:46:31,570
Seve: To finalize my contribution
and my record in the Ryder Cup,

912
01:46:32,400 --> 01:46:38,328
I fell that I needed to be the captain.
I thought It was my obligation.

913
01:46:39,840 --> 01:46:42,411
Broadcaster: Carmen leading the cheers.

914
01:46:42,560 --> 01:46:48,488
It is a great honour for me
to welcome you to Valderrama today,

915
01:46:48,640 --> 01:46:51,325
to the thirty-second Ryder Cup matches.

916
01:46:51,480 --> 01:46:53,050
(crowd cheering)

917
01:46:55,840 --> 01:46:58,286
Golfer: In the beginning Seve was great.

918
01:46:58,440 --> 01:47:03,924
"I don't want to put any pressure on you,
I want you to relax. No pressure at all."

919
01:47:04,080 --> 01:47:07,721
Skip to Saturday night: "We have to win!

920
01:47:07,880 --> 01:47:09,291
We have to try hard.

921
01:47:09,480 --> 01:47:15,522
Don't hit it in the bunker. Don't three
putt. Don't hit into the trees on 16!

922
01:47:15,680 --> 01:47:18,490
Seve was off the charts when he was captain.

923
01:47:22,120 --> 01:47:25,283
Was he a good captain?
Seve got the result.

924
01:47:26,360 --> 01:47:28,124
I'll leave it like that.

925
01:47:28,280 --> 01:47:33,241
Golfer: Monty asked me: "Am I playing?"
I said: "Don't ask me, ask your captain."

926
01:47:33,400 --> 01:47:38,122
I had to tel! all the guys:
"Go and ask him straight: am I playing or not?"

927
01:47:39,080 --> 01:47:42,801
Seve: Because of the rules,
I had to leave four guys out.

928
01:47:42,960 --> 01:47:45,804
Interviewer:
Was it difficult to tell them?

929
01:47:46,960 --> 01:47:50,851
Wife. they... I haven't talked to them.

930
01:47:51,760 --> 01:47:56,084
Colin M.: He wanted to play Langer's,
Faldo's, mine, everybody shot.

931
01:47:56,280 --> 01:48:00,080
Then he came up to me and he told me
how to do it and what to do.

932
01:48:01,160 --> 01:48:06,326
<i>I had to be quite rude at one stage,
I said: "I'm sorry, Seve. I'm okay."</i>

933
01:48:09,040 --> 01:48:14,524
Golfer: Colin Montgomerie said he wished
he'd just get on his buggy and go away.

934
01:48:14,680 --> 01:48:19,891
Olazabal: He was trying 100 percent, never
gave up, and he takes that everywhere.

935
01:48:20,040 --> 01:48:22,441
On as well as off the golf course.

936
01:48:22,640 --> 01:48:26,122
<i>I said: "Captain, that's it."</i>

937
01:48:26,280 --> 01:48:28,521
(crowd cheering)

938
01:48:28,680 --> 01:48:32,651
Broadcaster:
Montgomerie gets the nod and it's victory

939
01:48:32,800 --> 01:48:35,246
for Seve's stars and Southern Spain.

940
01:48:35,440 --> 01:48:39,286
Somewhere in there is Severiano Ballesteros.

941
01:48:39,440 --> 01:48:42,603
And Seve, this week, has been master of the game.

942
01:48:42,760 --> 01:48:46,924
Interviewer: Fabulous moment.
Proudest moment of your career?

943
01:48:47,120 --> 01:48:51,091
I think so. I've won many great
tournaments around the world,

944
01:48:51,240 --> 01:48:55,211
I've won five majors, five world matches,

945
01:48:55,360 --> 01:48:58,887
six orders of merit and all that.
But this is very special.

946
01:49:00,960 --> 01:49:04,851
He was tremendously inﬂuential
and a pain in the neck to some,

947
01:49:05,000 --> 01:49:07,924
but all in all he was a giant, and for a some years

948
01:49:08,080 --> 01:49:11,527
he ruled the roost and inspired Europeans all over.

949
01:49:11,680 --> 01:49:13,205
(crowd cheering)

950
01:49:13,400 --> 01:49:16,961
Broadcaster:
If I wanted a cup right now, it's Seve's.

951
01:49:24,520 --> 01:49:26,602
(slow piano music)

952
01:49:27,320 --> 01:49:32,360
Seve: Golf, it can really make you
feel like you are like God one day.

953
01:49:32,520 --> 01:49:35,410
And the next day it makes you feel miserable.

954
01:49:35,560 --> 01:49:40,043
Lately I have to say that things have been
very rough and very difficult for me.

955
01:49:40,200 --> 01:49:41,770
I miss my family.

956
01:49:44,280 --> 01:49:47,284
The life is not as easy as many people may think.

957
01:49:49,160 --> 01:49:52,050
Interviewer: Did you think:
"What more can I do?

958
01:49:52,200 --> 01:49:54,680
Surely it's time for me to retire now?"

959
01:49:54,840 --> 01:49:57,366
Retire? Never.

960
01:49:57,520 --> 01:50:00,967
Interviewer: Never retire?
- The white ﬂag up? Never.

961
01:50:01,120 --> 01:50:04,442
It would be a surrender, wouldn't it?
- Yes. Never.

962
01:50:06,400 --> 01:50:10,405
Seve: I still produce better shots
than anybody else there.

963
01:50:10,560 --> 01:50:15,043
Chip. Bunker shot. Under the trees.
Whatever.

964
01:50:16,040 --> 01:50:20,364
And I think I can produce, now and then, good golf.

965
01:50:20,520 --> 01:50:22,170
(cheers)

966
01:50:23,160 --> 01:50:24,969
Interviewer: That's enough?

967
01:50:25,120 --> 01:50:29,011
Seve: I don't need to prove
that I'm Severiano Ballesteros

968
01:50:29,160 --> 01:50:32,721
and I can still beat those youngsters. No.

969
01:50:32,880 --> 01:50:38,489
Nobody told me when to start playing golf
Why should anyone tell me when to retire?

970
01:50:38,640 --> 01:50:40,722
(onlookers applaud)

971
01:50:42,840 --> 01:50:44,410
When I die.

972
01:50:45,480 --> 01:50:47,482
Retire? Never.

973
01:50:49,800 --> 01:50:52,929
Peter Allies: His bad back
was the biggest problem.

974
01:50:53,120 --> 01:50:57,125
It was really sad to see
the decline of his once brilliant game.

975
01:50:57,840 --> 01:51:03,006
I really thought he would go on forever.
I thought he was indestructible.

976
01:51:03,160 --> 01:51:05,208
Seve: It was an internal fight.

977
01:51:07,040 --> 01:51:09,247
It was difficult for quite a while.

978
01:51:11,040 --> 01:51:12,963
So that really made me think,

979
01:51:14,240 --> 01:51:15,810
very deeply.

980
01:51:19,600 --> 01:51:24,527
The real question is:
Either you continue, or you stop playing.

981
01:51:26,080 --> 01:51:29,880
And I've made probably the most difficult decision

982
01:51:30,040 --> 01:51:33,522
of my career as a player.

983
01:51:35,040 --> 01:51:37,327
And I decided to retire.

984
01:51:37,480 --> 01:51:39,721
(soft piano music)

985
01:51:40,680 --> 01:51:42,091
(hit)

986
01:51:44,080 --> 01:51:49,371
Seve: To say that I'm not going to play
golf anymore...

987
01:51:54,000 --> 01:51:59,689
is like taking a piece of your heart and putting it away.

988
01:52:03,280 --> 01:52:04,850
I'm okay, I'm okay”.

989
01:52:07,520 --> 01:52:11,809
There's still some kind sadness there
because it's not easy to accept

990
01:52:11,960 --> 01:52:17,490
<i>you are retired from something you have
done for thirty-three years.</i>

991
01:52:17,640 --> 01:52:19,722
(crowd cheering)

992
01:52:20,520 --> 01:52:22,249
Seve: It's... not easy.

993
01:52:22,400 --> 01:52:24,562
(crowd cheering)

994
01:52:24,720 --> 01:52:28,281
Broadcaster: Seve did his
little boxing routine at the end

995
01:52:28,440 --> 01:52:33,401
which I'm sure well see time and time
again. And wasn't it all worthwhile.

996
01:52:35,480 --> 01:52:38,484
I've been lucky to have three opportunities

997
01:52:38,640 --> 01:52:44,443
to get a chance to pick his brains and
spend time with him, just chipping.

998
01:52:44,600 --> 01:52:46,523
I learned so much in short time.

999
01:52:46,680 --> 01:52:51,527
How to play shots.
It was phenomenal.

1000
01:52:51,680 --> 01:52:55,002
Broadcaster:
He pitched it just short of the green

1001
01:52:55,200 --> 01:52:58,329
and he looks to have got the pace to perfection.

1002
01:52:59,040 --> 01:53:01,850
I couldn't pull it off, but he always did.

1003
01:53:02,040 --> 01:53:04,122
(applause)

1004
01:53:07,520 --> 01:53:10,729
I think all of us golfers are going to miss him.

1005
01:53:13,960 --> 01:53:19,842
Seve: Everything starts
and everything has to finish.

1006
01:53:21,640 --> 01:53:23,722
(soft acoustic guitar music)

1007
01:53:34,640 --> 01:53:37,564
Severiano Ballesteros is in a stable condition

1008
01:53:37,720 --> 01:53:39,609
after a brain tumor operation.

1009
01:53:39,760 --> 01:53:43,128
<i>The golfing legend was diagnosed with a tumor last week</i>

1010
01:53:43,280 --> 01:53:45,123
after collapsing in Madrid.

1011
01:53:45,280 --> 01:53:50,207
Doctors operated straight away
because of the serious situation.

1012
01:53:59,840 --> 01:54:05,051
Seve: I didn't want to feel any panic
or show my emotions to them

1013
01:54:05,200 --> 01:54:07,885
<i>because you don't win anything by doing that</i>

1014
01:54:08,040 --> 01:54:12,762
so the best thing is to just be prepared and to be relaxed

1015
01:54:12,920 --> 01:54:17,050
and show a good, optimistic position.

1016
01:54:22,040 --> 01:54:27,001
Life is like a sport.
You have to fight every day for things.

1017
01:54:27,160 --> 01:54:31,529
Fight all the way.
The key is to just never give up.

1018
01:54:34,440 --> 01:54:36,807
And this is what I would call destiny.

1019
01:54:37,480 --> 01:54:40,927
One test that God is putting on me.

1020
01:54:41,680 --> 01:54:45,890
And I am winning. I'm going to
hole the 18th putt at St. Andrews.

1021
01:54:46,040 --> 01:54:47,610
(chuckles)

1022
01:54:48,920 --> 01:54:53,209
With great pleasure we welcome
live from his home in Pedrena, Spain,

1023
01:54:53,400 --> 01:54:55,164
Severiano Ballesteros.

1024
01:54:55,360 --> 01:54:57,886
(applause) (orchestral show music)

1025
01:55:13,360 --> 01:55:15,010
(music fades out)

1026
01:55:15,160 --> 01:55:20,530
It is an immense pleasure for me
to present you with this award.

1027
01:55:21,200 --> 01:55:23,680
The Lifetime Achievement Award.

1028
01:55:23,840 --> 01:55:26,969
And for this, I think we should stand up.
- Yes.

1029
01:55:28,880 --> 01:55:31,531
Congratulations, my friend.
- Thank you.

1030
01:55:31,680 --> 01:55:34,809
From a great champion like you are.
- Thank you.

1031
01:55:34,960 --> 01:55:37,406
(applause fades in)

1032
01:55:39,760 --> 01:55:41,000
Thank you to you all.

1033
01:55:59,840 --> 01:56:01,922
(soft piano music)

1034
01:56:23,320 --> 01:56:26,529
I don't want to see you people feel sorry for me.

1035
01:56:26,680 --> 01:56:29,286
I've been the luckiest person in the world.

1036
01:56:29,440 --> 01:56:34,002
I've had so much luck and
I've had so much fun for so many years

1037
01:56:34,160 --> 01:56:40,042
that this thing that just happened to me
is just a very little thing

1038
01:56:40,200 --> 01:56:45,081
compared to other people who have tougher times.

1039
01:56:45,240 --> 01:56:49,325
And they don't have the opportunity to live a life

1040
01:56:49,520 --> 01:56:52,842
so intense and as good as I did.

1041
01:56:53,000 --> 01:56:55,002
So, thank you very much.

1042
01:56:55,160 --> 01:56:58,004
And I love you all from my heart.
Thank you.

1043
01:57:02,720 --> 01:57:07,931
Newsreader: The former world number
one golfer, Seve Ballesteros, has died.

1044
01:57:08,120 --> 01:57:11,090
He lost his three-year battle
with a brain tumor

1045
01:57:11,240 --> 01:57:13,925
at his home in northern Spain this morning.

1046
01:57:14,080 --> 01:57:16,162
(soft acoustic guitar music)

1047
01:57:25,640 --> 01:57:27,165
He was just a kid...

1048
01:57:28,760 --> 01:57:30,285
in his village.

1049
01:57:32,200 --> 01:57:33,770
(sighs)

1050
01:57:41,000 --> 01:57:43,082
(some onlookers cheer)

1051
01:57:43,720 --> 01:57:48,965
Broadcaster: Right in the heart of the
hole. A five Birdie finish for lan Poulter

1052
01:57:49,160 --> 01:57:53,051
and he's given hope to the European side
that looked totally lost.

1053
01:57:53,200 --> 01:57:56,443
United States, ten. Europe, six.

1054
01:57:57,760 --> 01:58:01,401
Ian <i>Poulter: We've got a chance.
If we can do anything</i>

1055
01:58:01,560 --> 01:58:05,565
to get our hands on this trophy
and Seve's looking down on us,

1056
01:58:05,760 --> 01:58:08,240
then you gotta do what you gotta do.

1057
01:58:13,280 --> 01:58:17,205
Broadcaster: And this is quite a shot.
Go in! Go in!

1058
01:58:17,400 --> 01:58:20,927
That a boy, Paul! How about that shot!

1059
01:58:22,400 --> 01:58:23,447
(hit)

1060
01:58:27,640 --> 01:58:29,927
Broadcaster: Brilliant. Brilliant.

1061
01:58:30,120 --> 01:58:31,804
(applause)

1062
01:58:31,960 --> 01:58:34,122
Broadcaster: Fantastic, Rory!

1063
01:58:38,920 --> 01:58:43,084
What a shot by lan Poulter, our the trees at eighteen.

1064
01:58:45,000 --> 01:58:47,082
(crowd cheering)

1065
01:58:49,800 --> 01:58:53,566
Broadcaster: He's got it.
This could happen here.

1066
01:58:53,720 --> 01:58:57,167
I've just glanced down and had a look at my left sleeve

1067
01:58:57,320 --> 01:59:00,642
and that's the kind of stuff he would have done today.

1068
01:59:07,280 --> 01:59:09,282
Broadcaster: Thirteen hole.

1069
01:59:09,440 --> 01:59:11,920
Europe have to find a full point.

1070
01:59:14,240 --> 01:59:16,322
(applause fades in)

1071
01:59:16,480 --> 01:59:20,371
Broadcaster:
Our fate now is in the hands of Kaymer.

1072
01:59:21,160 --> 01:59:24,403
A putt to win or lose the Ryder Cup...

1073
01:59:24,560 --> 01:59:27,484
(crowd cheers)

1074
01:59:27,680 --> 01:59:31,321
Broadcaster:
Unbelievable. It's Europe's Ryder Cup.

1075
01:59:33,840 --> 01:59:35,763
Seve must have enjoyed that.

1076
01:59:39,480 --> 01:59:42,643
Justin Rose:
We've got Seve on the arm and on the back

1077
01:59:42,800 --> 01:59:44,848
I know he's up there, but...

1078
01:59:45,000 --> 01:59:47,367
he'd be the proudest man in the world right now.

1079
01:59:50,280 --> 01:59:54,251
Olazabal:
I have a few thoughts for my friend, Seve

1080
01:59:54,400 --> 01:59:58,246
and this one is for him.

1081
02:00:01,520 --> 02:00:03,602
(slow string music)

1082
02:00:05,640 --> 02:00:08,849
(people distantly chanting)
Seve! Seve! Seve!

1083
02:00:16,000 --> 02:00:19,243
I'm pretty sure he's very happy where he is today.

1084
02:00:20,160 --> 02:00:22,242
(applause)

1085
02:00:25,560 --> 02:00:28,291
(chanting fades out)
Seve! Seve! Seve!

1086
02:00:28,440 --> 02:00:30,522
(string music continues)

1087
02:00:41,520 --> 02:00:42,567
(hit)

1088
02:00:55,400 --> 02:00:57,528
(waves crashing)

1089
02:01:40,240 --> 02:01:42,846
(rhythmic flute and guitar music)
