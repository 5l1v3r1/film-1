1
00:01:47,595 --> 00:01:50,435
A wave of riots has swept US prisons.

2
00:01:50,435 --> 00:01:53,066
Within 20 months, riots
have occurred in 35 states.

3
00:01:53,108 --> 00:01:57,703
It began in New Jersey and moved
quickly to Jackson, Michigan.

4
00:01:57,745 --> 00:02:02,340
Here at Michigan penitentiary
for five days the world's largest

5
00:02:02,381 --> 00:02:05,180
walled prison is torn to
pieces by a maddened convicts

6
00:02:05,223 --> 00:02:07,979
who destroy everything
they can put their hands on.

7
00:02:08,021 --> 00:02:11,655
Damage is estimated at $2.5 million.

8
00:02:11,696 --> 00:02:14,203
Then, in Pennsylvania, inmates

9
00:02:14,245 --> 00:02:17,419
seize five guards as hostages
in western state penitentiary.

10
00:02:17,419 --> 00:02:19,048
Damage runs high

11
00:02:19,048 --> 00:02:22,516
as we can see in this in view inside
one of the wrecked cell blocks.

12
00:02:22,558 --> 00:02:26,568
At almost the same time,
231 convicts carry out

13
00:02:26,609 --> 00:02:30,243
a similar rebellion in New
Jersey at the state prison farm.

14
00:02:30,243 --> 00:02:31,956
Here, bed sheets

15
00:02:31,998 --> 00:02:34,921
scrawled with slogans are
hung from broken windows.

16
00:02:34,963 --> 00:02:39,558
The convicts hold out for 4½ days
before submitting to authority.

17
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:43,610
In Chester, Illinois state police are called.

18
00:02:43,651 --> 00:02:45,741
Ten guards are held as hostages,

19
00:02:45,782 --> 00:02:48,581
three by prisoners in
the psychiatric division.

20
00:02:48,623 --> 00:02:52,048
Here the inmates insist on
speaking only to the Governor

21
00:02:52,089 --> 00:02:53,677
about their grievances.

22
00:02:53,677 --> 00:02:56,601
These riots, costing millions

23
00:02:56,643 --> 00:03:00,276
and millions of tax payer dollars,
have aroused great public interest.

24
00:03:17,361 --> 00:03:22,332
Mr McGee, what in your opinion is
the reason these riots occurred?

25
00:03:22,833 --> 00:03:26,718
I'd like to paraphrase the report
of the American Prison Association

26
00:03:26,759 --> 00:03:28,974
on riots and their causes.

27
00:03:29,016 --> 00:03:32,232
The recent widespread
occurrence of prison riots

28
00:03:32,274 --> 00:03:36,492
is almost always the direct
result of the short-sighted neglect

29
00:03:36,534 --> 00:03:40,711
of our penal institutions, amounting
to almost criminal negligence.

30
00:03:40,753 --> 00:03:43,927
Who's responsible for this negligence?

31
00:03:43,969 --> 00:03:48,356
Public leaders such as Governors,
legislators and others who must share

32
00:03:48,397 --> 00:03:52,741
the responsibility for prisons as well
as for other branches of government.

33
00:03:52,784 --> 00:03:55,791
And that neglect includes the public?

34
00:03:55,832 --> 00:03:59,592
Yes, indeed. In the final
analysis, especially the public.

35
00:03:59,592 --> 00:04:04,604
One final question, do you look
to further riots in the future?

36
00:04:05,941 --> 00:04:08,990
I abhor riot and disorder but
until something is done it to

37
00:04:09,032 --> 00:04:13,334
correct the situation we'll not
see the end of prison troubles.

38
00:04:13,377 --> 00:04:14,797
Thank you, Mr McGee.

39
00:04:14,839 --> 00:04:18,890
All over America, prison officials wonder

40
00:04:18,932 --> 00:04:21,355
where will the next riot occur?

41
00:04:43,368 --> 00:04:45,122
Mac, you ever been in the punishment block?

42
00:04:45,122 --> 00:04:46,042
No.

43
00:04:46,083 --> 00:04:49,049
Keep your nose clean or
we'll leave you in there.

44
00:05:13,694 --> 00:05:15,448
How is it doing after a couple of weeks?

45
00:05:15,825 --> 00:05:20,461
I like it. I still can't help
but feeling sorry for these guys.

46
00:05:20,503 --> 00:05:23,218
You'll get over it.

47
00:05:23,218 --> 00:05:25,892
OK with the crosses.

48
00:05:25,892 --> 00:05:27,771
What's so different about these guys?

49
00:05:27,771 --> 00:05:30,110
X marks the wild animal.

50
00:05:49,283 --> 00:05:51,038
Must be Thursday.

51
00:06:03,402 --> 00:06:05,156
Are you going to feed or ain't ya?

52
00:06:05,156 --> 00:06:08,247
You know what you can do with that garbage.
- Take it!

53
00:06:10,085 --> 00:06:11,130
This is Auto Tower, folks, bringing

54
00:06:11,171 --> 00:06:13,845
you the greatest value in used cars.

55
00:06:13,886 --> 00:06:17,228
We're actually giving these cars away.

56
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:20,570
If I'd a-knew that, I wouldn't be here!

57
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:25,457
I want you to rush right down
here to 27-30 Main Street.

58
00:06:25,457 --> 00:06:29,760
Get that? 27-30 Main Street. Right away.

59
00:06:29,801 --> 00:06:31,263
I'm a-comin', boss!

60
00:06:31,305 --> 00:06:36,526
"Don't wait. The right car
for the right price for you. "

61
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:38,991
Thanks.

62
00:06:51,856 --> 00:06:55,658
I've got to find out about my kid.
- Put it in writing to the Warden.

63
00:07:03,135 --> 00:07:05,599
Colonel? Colonel?

64
00:07:05,808 --> 00:07:07,228
Yeah, Frank?

65
00:07:07,896 --> 00:07:10,779
You're up for parole
consideration, aren't you?

66
00:07:10,821 --> 00:07:12,450
That's right.

67
00:07:12,491 --> 00:07:16,711
Do me a favour, when you get out, find
out if my little girl is still sick.

68
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:21,013
I'm not out yet.

69
00:07:21,765 --> 00:07:25,524
I got to find out. I ain't
heard in almost two months.

70
00:07:25,524 --> 00:07:27,404
Your wife will write you.

71
00:07:27,446 --> 00:07:28,699
She won’t write.

72
00:07:28,741 --> 00:07:31,581
It's the reason I'm in here.

73
00:07:35,674 --> 00:07:37,805
I thought I told you to take that bush off.

74
00:07:37,972 --> 00:07:39,393
Yes, sir.

75
00:08:21,832 --> 00:08:23,669
Er... 63.

76
00:08:24,672 --> 00:08:26,009
Gotcha.

77
00:08:37,246 --> 00:08:38,289
Barrett speaking.

78
00:08:38,415 --> 00:08:39,543
Block 11. 238.

79
00:08:40,712 --> 00:08:42,007
Hold it a minute.

80
00:08:46,936 --> 00:08:48,106
Go ahead.

81
00:08:48,148 --> 00:08:50,027
'Block 11, 238.'

82
00:08:50,069 --> 00:08:53,286
11, 238. OK, you're in.

83
00:08:55,625 --> 00:08:57,087
Barrett, go ahead.

84
00:08:57,129 --> 00:08:58,967
'Block 4, 637.'

85
00:08:59,009 --> 00:09:02,559
4 block, 637. OK, you're in.

86
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:05,817
Go ahead, 5.

87
00:09:05,817 --> 00:09:07,321
'Block 5, 433.'

88
00:09:07,362 --> 00:09:10,119
5, 433. OK, you're in.

89
00:09:22,651 --> 00:09:26,702
Oh Lord, God of my salvation, I've
cried day and night before thee,

90
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,502
let my prayer come before thee,

91
00:09:29,502 --> 00:09:32,802
incline thine ear unto my cry, for my soul is

92
00:09:32,843 --> 00:09:37,564
full of troubles, and my life draws
nigh unto the grave, I am counted

93
00:09:37,605 --> 00:09:42,284
with them that go down into the pit.
I am as a man that hath no strength,

94
00:09:42,284 --> 00:09:46,001
free among the dead like the
slain that lie in the grave,

95
00:09:46,042 --> 00:09:48,507
whom thou remembers no more.

96
00:09:48,507 --> 00:09:54,815
Thou hast laid me in the lowest
pit, in darkness, in the deeps...

97
00:09:56,778 --> 00:09:57,906
Dummy up, will ya!

98
00:09:58,073 --> 00:10:00,203
Knock it off!
- Somebody slug that creep.

99
00:10:00,747 --> 00:10:01,707
Mother!

100
00:10:04,715 --> 00:10:06,052
Mother!

101
00:10:19,042 --> 00:10:20,504
Monroe!

102
00:10:23,512 --> 00:10:26,018
Monroe, 48!

103
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:44,606
Yeah?

104
00:10:47,070 --> 00:10:48,658
Yeah, what do you want, Schuyler?

105
00:10:48,825 --> 00:10:54,590
They're moving me to a new cell block tomorrow and
I've got a present for Gator. Would you give it to him?

106
00:10:54,631 --> 00:10:56,344
Yeah, sure.

107
00:12:37,931 --> 00:12:40,146
How d'you make it?
- I got Monroe.

108
00:12:40,188 --> 00:12:43,821
Good, now for the others. There's four
screws tonight, we've gotta grab them all.

109
00:12:43,863 --> 00:12:45,283
Snader's mine.

110
00:12:45,366 --> 00:12:48,666
No cutting, Carnie. We're going
to keep them alive. That's my plan.

111
00:13:10,388 --> 00:13:11,474
Snader.

112
00:13:36,077 --> 00:13:38,207
Open your trap and we'll cut you a new one.

113
00:13:38,207 --> 00:13:40,631
You're not supposed to have this, Snader.

114
00:13:41,674 --> 00:13:43,429
Right, drag him out.

115
00:13:49,486 --> 00:13:50,530
Acton!

116
00:14:19,770 --> 00:14:23,446
Hey! Monroe! Snader!

117
00:14:25,326 --> 00:14:28,709
Hey! Monroe! Snader!

118
00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:30,505
Go ahead.

119
00:14:33,512 --> 00:14:37,189
Schuyler, keep that
screw away from the phone!

120
00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:04,590
Grab his feet.

121
00:15:05,677 --> 00:15:07,765
Hurry up! Let's go!

122
00:15:08,350 --> 00:15:10,772
I want out!
- Let me at the screws!

123
00:15:10,814 --> 00:15:12,945
Open up the cells.

124
00:15:12,987 --> 00:15:15,493
Let me out, Dunn! Let me out of here!

125
00:15:19,335 --> 00:15:21,340
I can't believe it's happening!

126
00:15:24,307 --> 00:15:26,187
All right! Let's go!

127
00:15:27,607 --> 00:15:29,152
Let's kill those screws!

128
00:15:30,990 --> 00:15:32,870
Where's the screws?!

129
00:16:07,582 --> 00:16:08,292
Barrett speaking.

130
00:16:08,333 --> 00:16:11,758
This is Dunn. We've got 11
block and four of your guards.

131
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:13,513
You've got what?

132
00:16:13,513 --> 00:16:16,437
Get the Warden down here or we're
gonna to kill every one of them.

133
00:16:17,648 --> 00:16:19,695
Riot in cell block 11.

134
00:16:24,625 --> 00:16:26,755
What's that?
- What's the sirens for?

135
00:16:26,796 --> 00:16:29,093
I don't know, but I bet it's 11.

136
00:16:29,803 --> 00:16:31,308
I'm sure it's the guys in solitary.

137
00:16:31,308 --> 00:16:32,686
It's a break!

138
00:16:34,023 --> 00:16:35,945
Those guys got guts enough to try anything.

139
00:17:04,892 --> 00:17:06,563
Well, here we go again.

140
00:17:06,605 --> 00:17:09,486
Yeah, and all for 50 bucks a week.

141
00:17:14,165 --> 00:17:17,799
Doctor Barrett? I've got your
open line to the Governor's office.

142
00:17:17,799 --> 00:17:19,888
Yes, sir, I'll monitor all calls from 11.

143
00:17:19,930 --> 00:17:21,768
Here's the officer.

144
00:17:21,768 --> 00:17:25,401
Armoury, how many men have checked in?

145
00:17:25,443 --> 00:17:27,908
Second watch is coming in now.

146
00:17:27,950 --> 00:17:31,166
Good, speed them along. Now here's
the way I want them dispersed.

147
00:17:31,208 --> 00:17:34,758
'Two in one block, five in three block,'

148
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:40,523
two unarmed in four block, those
to be armed get rifles and tear gas.

149
00:17:40,564 --> 00:17:43,113
And tell them not to get itchy fingers.

150
00:17:44,073 --> 00:17:46,496
All right boys, come on, hurry up.

151
00:17:46,538 --> 00:17:49,295
Watch those itchy fingers. Captain's orders.

152
00:18:03,038 --> 00:18:06,296
Hello? Get me through to Barrett.

153
00:18:06,338 --> 00:18:08,384
Well, cut in on him.

154
00:18:08,426 --> 00:18:11,643
Hello. Hello, Barrett?
This is Ambrose, what's up?

155
00:18:11,643 --> 00:18:14,817
A riot in 11 block. The
Warden's on his way down.

156
00:18:14,859 --> 00:18:16,279
I'm at the gate, I'll wait for the Warden.

157
00:18:16,279 --> 00:18:18,326
Right, I'll meet you in the yard.

158
00:18:36,914 --> 00:18:38,209
All right, take it easy!

159
00:18:41,843 --> 00:18:43,848
That's enough! That's enough!

160
00:18:46,646 --> 00:18:49,236
Dummy up! Shut up!

161
00:18:49,236 --> 00:18:49,946
Knock it off.

162
00:18:51,325 --> 00:18:52,536
All right, cut it out.

163
00:18:52,536 --> 00:18:56,714
Quiet down.

164
00:18:59,178 --> 00:19:00,807
Pipe down.

165
00:19:04,859 --> 00:19:06,154
If we're going to win this,

166
00:19:06,237 --> 00:19:08,117
we gotta have discipline.

167
00:19:09,078 --> 00:19:11,542
Carnie and me are running the show.

168
00:19:13,213 --> 00:19:15,552
We all know what's wrong here.

169
00:19:15,594 --> 00:19:19,479
We're gonna ask for changes, just
like they did the other prisons.

170
00:19:19,521 --> 00:19:23,656
If they don't give it to us, we'll
make them a present of one dead guard.

171
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:28,000
Or maybe four!

172
00:19:30,507 --> 00:19:33,514
It may take all of them. But they'll listen.

173
00:19:37,315 --> 00:19:42,161
Me and some of my friends are only in here because
there ain't no room for us in any other block.

174
00:19:42,202 --> 00:19:43,622
Now we don't want no trouble.

175
00:19:48,635 --> 00:19:49,763
Lay off!

176
00:19:52,687 --> 00:19:54,775
You're either in or out. OK?

177
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:15,954
You all covered?

178
00:20:15,954 --> 00:20:16,998
Yes, sir.

179
00:20:16,998 --> 00:20:18,460
All posts covered?

180
00:20:18,502 --> 00:20:19,839
First thing I did.

181
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:23,264
Doubled up in your building?
- Yes, sir.

182
00:20:23,305 --> 00:20:25,060
Who did they grab in 11?

183
00:20:25,102 --> 00:20:26,772
Snader, Acton, Monroe...

184
00:20:26,814 --> 00:20:30,155
Monroe? Who assigned him to that block?

185
00:20:30,197 --> 00:20:31,618
It was my suggestion.

186
00:20:31,660 --> 00:20:34,124
That was a mistake. Figure him pretty green.

187
00:20:34,124 --> 00:20:35,210
That block takes six guards.

188
00:20:35,252 --> 00:20:39,512
He's tough enough to take out
four. You know how short we are.

189
00:20:41,602 --> 00:20:43,565
All right, Dunn, I'm here.

190
00:20:46,739 --> 00:20:49,663
I want your word, Warden,
that I'll have safe conduct.

191
00:20:49,747 --> 00:20:53,422
I promise you no harm will come
to you during this conversation.

192
00:20:54,550 --> 00:20:55,970
Guard!

193
00:20:56,012 --> 00:20:59,229
These are my instructions.
Dunn is to be allowed to

194
00:20:59,270 --> 00:21:04,115
come out into this yard and to
return to 11 without interference.

195
00:21:04,158 --> 00:21:05,453
How about it, Dunn?

196
00:21:05,453 --> 00:21:07,123
Sure, Warden.

197
00:21:08,585 --> 00:21:11,468
When he's ready, 16, open the gate.

198
00:21:12,763 --> 00:21:14,057
Want me to go with you?

199
00:21:14,057 --> 00:21:15,436
No.

200
00:21:15,645 --> 00:21:17,107
Just Snader.

201
00:21:26,630 --> 00:21:29,220
I gave you my word, Dunn.

202
00:21:29,262 --> 00:21:31,560
Hold that gate.

203
00:21:31,601 --> 00:21:35,110
I believe you, Warden, but
I don't trust your screws.

204
00:21:35,110 --> 00:21:36,572
You going to open up?

205
00:21:50,816 --> 00:21:51,902
What do you want, Dunn?

206
00:21:51,944 --> 00:21:55,745
I want the press here tonight.
- Inmates never win a riot, Dunn, you know that.

207
00:21:55,787 --> 00:21:57,458
That's my worry.

208
00:21:57,500 --> 00:22:00,173
Release the hostages, I'll get the press.

209
00:22:00,173 --> 00:22:03,390
Look, Dunn, I can't bargain with you
as long as you're holding these men.

210
00:22:03,431 --> 00:22:07,692
I wouldn't stand a chance
without hostages, and you know it.

211
00:22:07,733 --> 00:22:11,994
Give me your word you won't harm
the hostages, and I'll get the press.

212
00:22:12,036 --> 00:22:15,085
I can't hold my boys too long.
- A couple of hours.

213
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:18,218
OK.

214
00:22:20,975 --> 00:22:22,563
Attaboy, Dunn!

215
00:22:27,073 --> 00:22:28,368
Good work.

216
00:22:40,608 --> 00:22:42,320
How's it going, Carnie

217
00:22:42,361 --> 00:22:43,615
We're waiting.

218
00:22:43,656 --> 00:22:45,913
We ain't sleeping.

219
00:22:45,913 --> 00:22:47,876
Tony, make a list of all
this stuff here, will you?

220
00:22:47,918 --> 00:22:49,588
Hey, Dunn, I can use that wire.

221
00:22:49,630 --> 00:22:51,676
What do you want to do,
blow us through the roof?

222
00:22:56,063 --> 00:22:58,653
Hey, I've got something to show
you that's terrific, come on.

223
00:23:00,366 --> 00:23:01,451
Hey, what's that?

224
00:23:01,493 --> 00:23:04,041
Learned how to mix that cocktail in Normandy.

225
00:23:05,754 --> 00:23:08,428
Now watch this This is a real beauty.

226
00:23:12,396 --> 00:23:15,779
Hey. That's all right.

227
00:23:15,821 --> 00:23:19,329
Crash that through the bars of the
window, it would knock their brains out.

228
00:23:19,371 --> 00:23:20,624
Make some more of them.

229
00:23:22,838 --> 00:23:25,094
There we are. It's finished.

230
00:23:25,094 --> 00:23:28,226
How does that work?
- Here, lend me your neck a minute.

231
00:23:34,326 --> 00:23:37,041
Slip it over the screw's neck.

232
00:23:38,711 --> 00:23:40,926
How does that feel, screw?

233
00:23:44,643 --> 00:23:49,321
That's right, Governor, I need authority to
bargain with Dunn and to send for the state police.

234
00:23:49,446 --> 00:23:51,619
I warned you we were due for a riot.

235
00:23:51,744 --> 00:23:54,919
I've even got them sleeping
in the corridors of block four.

236
00:23:55,044 --> 00:23:58,177
You're always talking about overcrowding,
old plant, insufficient personnel.

237
00:23:58,219 --> 00:24:00,182
I don't want to argue that now.

238
00:24:00,224 --> 00:24:02,814
Right now I've got a riot on my hands.

239
00:24:02,856 --> 00:24:05,445
Give me the authority to act
before this things spreads.

240
00:24:05,445 --> 00:24:07,576
Warden, I can't let convicts

241
00:24:08,034 --> 00:24:10,457
dictate terms to the state.
I'll send Haskell right away.

242
00:24:11,961 --> 00:24:13,549
Yes, sir.

243
00:24:14,134 --> 00:24:15,011
Haskell.

244
00:24:15,052 --> 00:24:18,018
I don't know what that politician
will do here, these men can't vote.

245
00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:21,026
Monroe's wife.

246
00:24:21,026 --> 00:24:23,908
Yes, Mrs Monroe.

247
00:24:23,949 --> 00:24:25,579
Is it true my husband is in block 11?

248
00:24:25,621 --> 00:24:27,792
That's right, he is in the block.

249
00:24:27,834 --> 00:24:29,339
He'll be killed.

250
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:31,802
We're not going to let
anything happen to him,

251
00:24:31,844 --> 00:24:34,392
I promise you he'll be all right. Bye.

252
00:24:36,022 --> 00:24:39,572
Tell the operator not to put any
more of the guards' wives through.

253
00:24:39,614 --> 00:24:41,410
Tell them they'll be OK.

254
00:24:51,477 --> 00:24:53,315
I got four guys on the front gate.

255
00:24:53,357 --> 00:24:56,281
Two on the roof. The yard's all clear.

256
00:24:56,322 --> 00:24:58,286
Captain Barrett's got nothing on you, Gator.

257
00:24:59,330 --> 00:25:00,709
You working out demands?

258
00:25:00,750 --> 00:25:02,797
Well, we got a pretty good start.

259
00:25:02,839 --> 00:25:04,635
We should get the colonel in on this.

260
00:25:08,352 --> 00:25:11,444
I've been thinking about
that. We could sure use him.

261
00:25:12,112 --> 00:25:14,034
Well then use him.

262
00:25:18,252 --> 00:25:19,589
Yeah.

263
00:25:26,230 --> 00:25:27,192
Hey, Colonel.

264
00:25:29,948 --> 00:25:33,332
You're the only guy here besides
me who could lead this riot.

265
00:25:33,374 --> 00:25:34,794
You gonna help us?

266
00:25:38,512 --> 00:25:41,602
I had to hit that boy to
show these gonzos who's boss.

267
00:25:41,644 --> 00:25:44,860
On the street, they think we're
wild animals, tonight you proved it.

268
00:25:44,860 --> 00:25:47,450
What chance do we have if
we don't stick together?

269
00:25:47,534 --> 00:25:50,792
This place is bad enough,
don't you make it worse.

270
00:25:52,422 --> 00:25:54,802
We're trying to work up some demands.

271
00:25:54,844 --> 00:25:57,685
I'm asking everybody for
their beefs. What's yours?

272
00:25:57,768 --> 00:26:00,232
The same as everyone else, the whole setup.

273
00:26:00,274 --> 00:26:03,783
The bloody cages, the idleness,
but this riot won't change it.

274
00:26:03,825 --> 00:26:06,331
Well, what will?
- Maybe nothing.

275
00:26:06,331 --> 00:26:08,295
We're forgotten.

276
00:26:08,295 --> 00:26:10,215
Colonel, you've got education,

277
00:26:10,257 --> 00:26:13,683
medals, you're used to handling
men. Help us with the demands.

278
00:26:13,725 --> 00:26:15,479
Count me out.

279
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:17,192
I don't get it.

280
00:26:17,233 --> 00:26:18,988
There are a lot of reasons.

281
00:26:19,030 --> 00:26:21,620
For one thing, I'm up
for parole consideration.

282
00:26:23,583 --> 00:26:25,253
You're strictly for you.

283
00:26:27,802 --> 00:26:31,060
All right, you control the boys,
I'll help frame the demands.

284
00:26:31,102 --> 00:26:32,104
Hey, Carnie!

285
00:26:33,942 --> 00:26:36,198
Monroe here wants a cigarette.

286
00:26:36,448 --> 00:26:37,827
No.

287
00:26:38,495 --> 00:26:40,960
Sure, what’s the difference?

288
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:42,965
Sure.

289
00:26:43,006 --> 00:26:45,220
Give him the lighted end.

290
00:26:53,616 --> 00:26:54,786
Here.

291
00:26:55,621 --> 00:26:58,253
Take it, it's all right.

292
00:26:58,295 --> 00:27:00,383
Thanks.

293
00:27:00,425 --> 00:27:03,182
What are they doing? They're
not going to kill us, are they?

294
00:27:03,223 --> 00:27:04,811
You'll be OK for a while.

295
00:27:04,853 --> 00:27:08,027
It's not me, you understand, it's
my wife, we're going to have a baby.

296
00:27:08,069 --> 00:27:11,327
How can you afford a kid on your salary?

297
00:27:11,369 --> 00:27:14,543
I got two jobs, this one and one in town.

298
00:27:15,045 --> 00:27:17,885
If I could only get in touch with her...

299
00:27:17,927 --> 00:27:19,890
Now you know why the boys
fuss so much over letters.

300
00:27:19,890 --> 00:27:21,728
...to let her know I'm all right.

301
00:27:21,728 --> 00:27:24,193
They've got wives, too.

302
00:27:27,785 --> 00:27:31,795
You got a family?
- Sure. Wife and a kid.

303
00:27:34,343 --> 00:27:35,930
It's tough any way you look at it.

304
00:27:43,408 --> 00:27:47,877
I figure too good. I figure all
the time that it don't add up.

305
00:27:47,919 --> 00:27:49,506
I'm an accountant, a good one.

306
00:27:49,548 --> 00:27:51,219
Embezzlement?

307
00:27:51,261 --> 00:27:55,396
Nah, robbery. I'm out for while and
then I take something I don't need.

308
00:27:55,438 --> 00:27:58,905
Grocery, department store, it doesn't matter.

309
00:27:58,946 --> 00:28:01,369
You mean you don't need the stuff?
- No.

310
00:28:01,411 --> 00:28:04,293
Just gotta, that's all. Like
some fellas have to take a drink.

311
00:28:12,481 --> 00:28:17,117
You belong in a psycho ward. You
shouldn't be here. You're different.

312
00:28:17,159 --> 00:28:18,913
Different?

313
00:28:18,955 --> 00:28:22,296
Take Ray in 26. Armed robbery.

314
00:28:22,296 --> 00:28:26,056
You think all that happens is
he says, "I want something",

315
00:28:26,098 --> 00:28:27,852
and then he goes and gets it?

316
00:28:27,894 --> 00:28:32,781
Nah, it's not as simple as that.
Something wrong with him, too.

317
00:28:32,823 --> 00:28:34,285
You mean they're all nuts?

318
00:28:34,285 --> 00:28:37,794
Including the guards.

319
00:28:39,506 --> 00:28:41,261
Whose side you on, Mac?

320
00:28:41,303 --> 00:28:42,889
Course I...

321
00:28:57,426 --> 00:28:59,264
I need glasses to see.

322
00:29:00,434 --> 00:29:02,814
But not to think.

323
00:29:02,814 --> 00:29:04,653
But I can't put you through to the Warden,

324
00:29:04,694 --> 00:29:06,532
Mrs Snader, the press just arrived.

325
00:29:06,532 --> 00:29:08,412
Tell him I've got to talk to him.

326
00:29:08,454 --> 00:29:10,208
All right, Mrs Snader, I promise.

327
00:29:12,881 --> 00:29:15,847
No, I'm sorry, the Warden's
with the press, I can't cut in.

328
00:29:17,602 --> 00:29:19,983
What's a rookie guard doing in the hole?

329
00:29:20,024 --> 00:29:22,322
We don't have enough men
and they're not good enough.

330
00:29:22,447 --> 00:29:25,454
Most of them have to have other
jobs in order to make a living.

331
00:29:25,454 --> 00:29:27,794
Any idea why this started?

332
00:29:27,836 --> 00:29:30,844
Who's this Dunn?

333
00:29:30,885 --> 00:29:34,310
Armed robbery, third offence,
murder, second degree.

334
00:29:34,352 --> 00:29:38,279
Medical report says he's
homicidal. Dangerous and unbalanced.

335
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:41,036
He should be in a hospital
under psychiatric care.

336
00:29:41,077 --> 00:29:42,414
When do we get to see him?

337
00:29:42,414 --> 00:29:44,669
We're waiting on Commissioner Haskell.

338
00:29:44,711 --> 00:29:47,092
He's on his way here. Here's another one.

339
00:29:48,471 --> 00:29:52,272
Crazy Mike Carnie. In for
life. This is Dunn's pal.

340
00:29:52,397 --> 00:29:54,652
Transferred to us from
the state mental hospital.

341
00:29:54,694 --> 00:29:58,997
I've been trying to get him
transferred back, with Dunn. No luck.

342
00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:01,545
Are they all psychopaths?

343
00:30:01,587 --> 00:30:04,052
We've got all kinds here.

344
00:30:04,052 --> 00:30:06,682
Good and bad, just like on the outside.

345
00:30:06,725 --> 00:30:11,194
Here, this guy is known
around here as the Colonel.

346
00:30:11,236 --> 00:30:13,867
He is a colonel, too. Brilliant war record.

347
00:30:14,870 --> 00:30:18,421
Got drunk, fight in a bar, manslaughter.

348
00:30:18,462 --> 00:30:20,592
He's up for parole consideration.

349
00:30:20,634 --> 00:30:22,723
Should be out soon.

350
00:30:23,392 --> 00:30:25,897
These men aren't here forever.

351
00:30:25,897 --> 00:30:28,404
95% of them will be released.

352
00:30:29,365 --> 00:30:30,869
Not men like Dunn?

353
00:30:30,910 --> 00:30:33,750
He'll be living around you and your family.

354
00:30:33,792 --> 00:30:36,592
And 65% of them will break the law again.

355
00:30:37,510 --> 00:30:39,474
65%? That’s a pretty high figure.

356
00:30:39,515 --> 00:30:42,272
It proves we're not doing the job.

357
00:30:42,314 --> 00:30:45,154
Isn't that the same speech
you gave last summer?

358
00:30:45,196 --> 00:30:49,122
It's the same speech he's been
giving for the last nine years.

359
00:30:49,164 --> 00:30:51,002
Hello, Warden, hello everyone.

360
00:30:51,044 --> 00:30:52,380
Hi, Haskell.

361
00:30:52,422 --> 00:30:55,890
Let's get going, boys.

362
00:30:57,268 --> 00:30:59,398
Hello, Ryan, how are you?

363
00:30:59,398 --> 00:31:01,905
Hi, Jack.

364
00:31:01,905 --> 00:31:04,202
Hi.
- Nice seeing you, Bill.

365
00:31:05,247 --> 00:31:06,834
Earp.
- Mr Haskell.

366
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:10,760
It's a fine mess you've
gotten us into, Reynolds,

367
00:31:10,802 --> 00:31:12,807
let's clean it up fast, huh?

368
00:31:50,986 --> 00:31:53,367
All right, Dunn, here's the press.

369
00:32:02,807 --> 00:32:04,812
Let me see your hands.

370
00:32:10,117 --> 00:32:12,248
These are used on the inmates.

371
00:32:12,373 --> 00:32:14,461
Drop them or you can't come out.

372
00:32:14,963 --> 00:32:16,550
Come on, Dunn, hold up that chain.

373
00:32:16,675 --> 00:32:19,390
Now look fierce.
- Show a screw with the chains.

374
00:32:19,516 --> 00:32:20,894
Come on, Dunn, show us how the chain works.

375
00:32:20,936 --> 00:32:23,483
Sure, on you!

376
00:32:24,403 --> 00:32:26,491
I'm coming out.

377
00:32:28,163 --> 00:32:30,543
All right, 16, open the gate.

378
00:32:44,119 --> 00:32:46,834
Alright, Dunn, are you gonna give us
a statement, or do we ask questions?

379
00:32:46,918 --> 00:32:48,672
What about it?
- We've got a lot of beefs

380
00:32:48,798 --> 00:32:51,721
we want to bring to the
attention of the public.

381
00:32:51,721 --> 00:32:53,601
There's no work programme.

382
00:32:53,643 --> 00:32:55,731
Most of the guys are just sitting around,

383
00:32:55,773 --> 00:32:57,695
waiting for their time to run out.

384
00:32:57,736 --> 00:32:59,616
You're asking for work?
- Yeah.

385
00:32:59,658 --> 00:33:03,710
You think the public cares?
- They ought to, it's costing them a lot of dough.

386
00:33:03,710 --> 00:33:04,963
Your paper gonna print this?

387
00:33:05,005 --> 00:33:07,803
You know what we're interested in.

388
00:33:07,845 --> 00:33:12,858
Yeah. Mad dogs running wild.

389
00:33:12,899 --> 00:33:17,828
This place is badly organised.
Everybody's all jumbled up together.

390
00:33:17,870 --> 00:33:18,914
Mental cases with kids.

391
00:33:18,956 --> 00:33:22,048
We understand from Warden Reynolds
that you've threatened to kill

392
00:33:22,048 --> 00:33:24,053
the guards if your demands
are not met. Is that true?

393
00:33:24,136 --> 00:33:25,431
You heard right.

394
00:33:25,514 --> 00:33:28,188
Isn't that murder? In prison or out?

395
00:33:28,229 --> 00:33:31,237
This state will be
responsible for their deaths.

396
00:33:32,490 --> 00:33:34,954
We understand all the guards
are married. Some have children.

397
00:33:34,954 --> 00:33:36,584
So have we.

398
00:33:36,626 --> 00:33:38,714
You're not being killed.

399
00:33:39,090 --> 00:33:40,803
We're rotting to death.

400
00:33:41,388 --> 00:33:43,936
You know, Mr Haskell is here.
He's the Governor's representative.

401
00:33:43,977 --> 00:33:47,068
If you and he can get together
tonight, will you call off the riot?

402
00:33:47,611 --> 00:33:49,491
If we can get together.

403
00:33:51,287 --> 00:33:52,874
You heard Dunn, Mr Haskell.

404
00:33:52,916 --> 00:33:56,174
I'd appreciate reading
something like what I've said.

405
00:33:56,216 --> 00:33:59,307
I heard. His charges are without foundation.

406
00:33:59,349 --> 00:34:02,231
Isn't it a fact that the federal
government says that prisons

407
00:34:02,273 --> 00:34:04,027
of over 1,500 men are unmanageable?

408
00:34:04,069 --> 00:34:06,032
This prison was built to house 4,000 men.

409
00:34:06,074 --> 00:34:07,703
It cost the taxpayers $26 million.

410
00:34:07,745 --> 00:34:10,502
What do you want us to do, tear it down?

411
00:34:10,544 --> 00:34:13,176
What's the cause of the
riots, in your opinion?

412
00:34:13,217 --> 00:34:16,141
I'll give you a full statement
after I've talked to Dunn.

413
00:34:16,183 --> 00:34:19,441
In a case like this, either
the cons run the prison

414
00:34:19,483 --> 00:34:21,404
or the prison runs the cons.

415
00:34:21,404 --> 00:34:23,159
I wouldn't try to prove it tonight.

416
00:34:23,159 --> 00:34:25,749
Are you gonna get the state police?
- If I need them.

417
00:34:26,542 --> 00:34:28,296
We gotta feed that Haskell a guard.

418
00:34:28,338 --> 00:34:30,427
This is just the beginning. Take it easy.

419
00:34:30,469 --> 00:34:33,894
Reynolds, this thing can
spread. We can't let it.

420
00:34:33,894 --> 00:34:35,941
We have to settle it tonight.

421
00:34:41,705 --> 00:34:43,584
OK, Haskell, what you got?

422
00:34:43,627 --> 00:34:46,216
I want you to release the guards.

423
00:34:46,258 --> 00:34:47,469
I bet you do.

424
00:34:48,096 --> 00:34:49,307
What do you want?

425
00:34:49,349 --> 00:34:50,769
You tell me, what are you gonna do for us?

426
00:34:50,811 --> 00:34:52,774
I'll tell you what I'm gonna do for you.

427
00:34:52,816 --> 00:34:54,989
If you don't give up I'll see
that every one of you hang.

428
00:34:54,989 --> 00:34:56,952
Haskell, get away from me!

429
00:35:03,594 --> 00:35:04,387
Dunn!

430
00:35:04,429 --> 00:35:05,472
Haskell, come back!

431
00:35:06,309 --> 00:35:07,227
Dunn!

432
00:35:13,619 --> 00:35:15,331
There's our statement, boys.

433
00:35:15,707 --> 00:35:17,754
That's real brilliant, Carnie.

434
00:35:17,795 --> 00:35:20,177
You gave them just what they wanted!

435
00:35:25,189 --> 00:35:28,029
So far, the guys are behind me.

436
00:35:28,071 --> 00:35:30,034
But for how long?

437
00:35:30,076 --> 00:35:33,000
Some of them look up to you,
and they'll follow you, not me.

438
00:35:33,042 --> 00:35:35,089
You throw in with me and we sew up the block.

439
00:35:35,130 --> 00:35:38,890
I told you I would help organise the
demands. That's what I'm doing now.

440
00:35:38,932 --> 00:35:41,187
I want you to do more than
just fix up the language.

441
00:35:41,187 --> 00:35:43,860
I want you to check with the men so
they'll know you're for the demands.

442
00:35:43,902 --> 00:35:47,286
All right, I'm for the demands
but I'm against the riot.

443
00:35:47,327 --> 00:35:49,834
Maybe that's because you used to be brass.

444
00:35:49,875 --> 00:35:51,714
Maybe.

445
00:35:51,714 --> 00:35:53,009
I don't think so.

446
00:35:53,050 --> 00:35:56,559
Look, Colonel, every newspaper and
radio in the country is watching

447
00:35:56,601 --> 00:35:59,190
this riot. We'll never get
a chance like this again.

448
00:35:59,984 --> 00:36:01,572
Yeah, I know.

449
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:06,292
If we just get across that
anyone could land in prison,

450
00:36:06,334 --> 00:36:07,712
just like that...

451
00:36:11,305 --> 00:36:14,062
I'm just gonna serve my time and get out.

452
00:36:14,103 --> 00:36:16,484
And never come back?
- Yeah.

453
00:36:16,525 --> 00:36:18,572
And never come back.

454
00:36:18,615 --> 00:36:21,037
You still think you're different, don't you?

455
00:36:21,079 --> 00:36:26,133
No. But once you put this uniform
on, you not only look like a con,

456
00:36:26,175 --> 00:36:28,389
you feel like one.

457
00:36:28,430 --> 00:36:31,855
Yeah. Even if you don't come
back, you'll always be an ex-con,

458
00:36:31,898 --> 00:36:34,112
so why not come in the whole way?

459
00:36:34,195 --> 00:36:37,328
I can't, Dunn, it's like mutiny.
I just couldn't go through that.

460
00:36:37,370 --> 00:36:40,753
Maybe if you only had three
stinking years on the streets

461
00:36:40,795 --> 00:36:42,257
since you were 14, maybe
you'd know how I feel.

462
00:36:42,883 --> 00:36:44,722
We're wasting time.

463
00:36:44,763 --> 00:36:46,768
I'll do the best I can on the demands.

464
00:36:46,810 --> 00:36:48,732
Let's hope we can win some of them.

465
00:36:48,773 --> 00:36:50,903
Some of them? We've got to win them all.

466
00:37:23,402 --> 00:37:24,988
Jim.

467
00:37:25,783 --> 00:37:27,746
Eleven can make it, so can we.

468
00:37:27,788 --> 00:37:29,250
Don't rush it.

469
00:37:49,926 --> 00:37:52,558
Yeah, I know, we're all tired.

470
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:56,108
The guards will have to stay at
their posts until further notice.

471
00:37:56,485 --> 00:37:59,576
Warden, this is Mr Russell of
the New York Sun. He just flew in.

472
00:37:59,618 --> 00:38:01,623
Hello, Warden. How's Haskell doing?

473
00:38:01,748 --> 00:38:03,711
It's a flesh wound, he never was in danger.

474
00:38:03,753 --> 00:38:05,674
Excuse me, Warden,
kitchen crews have reported

475
00:38:05,716 --> 00:38:07,596
they're ready with breakfast, no incidents.

476
00:38:07,638 --> 00:38:09,810
Good. Feed the blocks one by one.

477
00:38:09,851 --> 00:38:14,196
Start as usual. Right now
We’re trying to feed 4,000 men.

478
00:38:14,238 --> 00:38:16,451
Pardon me, I have to check the yard.

479
00:38:16,493 --> 00:38:19,543
Bring him up to date.
- Sure. How about some coffee first?

480
00:38:19,584 --> 00:38:21,004
Fine.

481
00:38:21,589 --> 00:38:23,886
Yeah, what about the leg irons and chains?

482
00:38:23,886 --> 00:38:25,808
Yeah!

483
00:38:25,850 --> 00:38:29,108
It's all covered in number three.
You'll see it when it's finished.

484
00:38:29,150 --> 00:38:30,194
Finished yet, Colonel?

485
00:38:30,194 --> 00:38:31,739
Almost.

486
00:38:32,784 --> 00:38:34,413
That's another thing.

487
00:38:37,003 --> 00:38:39,968
Kids should be separated from guys like that.

488
00:38:41,263 --> 00:38:43,351
Kids should be separated from what?

489
00:38:43,603 --> 00:38:45,524
You heard me
- from guys like you.

490
00:38:45,566 --> 00:38:48,031
Get your nose out of my businessl

491
00:38:48,031 --> 00:38:50,620
Don't get too big for your breeches, sonny!

492
00:38:50,620 --> 00:38:52,291
Mickey!

493
00:38:52,333 --> 00:38:53,961
Drop it.

494
00:39:34,606 --> 00:39:35,859
Commissioner, how do you feel?

495
00:39:35,901 --> 00:39:37,947
All right, thanks.

496
00:39:39,033 --> 00:39:41,999
What's going on?

497
00:39:42,041 --> 00:39:44,714
We've fed one, two and three.

498
00:39:44,714 --> 00:39:46,176
Let four go, Barrett.

499
00:39:46,217 --> 00:39:48,097
Yes, sir.

500
00:39:51,439 --> 00:39:54,989
Delmar, Barrett speaking. Send four through.

501
00:39:55,031 --> 00:39:56,494
Yes.

502
00:40:10,027 --> 00:40:12,909
Isn't it kind of risky, letting
those men go past block 11

503
00:40:12,951 --> 00:40:14,455
on their way to the mess hall?

504
00:40:14,497 --> 00:40:15,917
It is.

505
00:40:15,959 --> 00:40:20,094
The only other way to do it is try
to feed 4,000 men in their cells.

506
00:40:20,136 --> 00:40:22,767
That has dangers, too. Don't
know if I could spare enough

507
00:40:22,809 --> 00:40:25,399
guards for an operation like
that and still maintain security.

508
00:40:26,319 --> 00:40:27,947
OK, keep moving.

509
00:40:39,852 --> 00:40:41,481
Barrett, 18.

510
00:40:42,191 --> 00:40:43,361
It's Dunn.

511
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:46,117
Yeah, Dunn.

512
00:40:46,201 --> 00:40:48,749
Warden, we'll be ready in about 15 minutes.

513
00:40:48,749 --> 00:40:51,464
Hold the phone.

514
00:40:51,506 --> 00:40:53,135
Dunn is ready to bargain.

515
00:40:53,135 --> 00:40:57,479
Tell him you'll call him back.
- I want to get this thing over with.

516
00:40:57,479 --> 00:40:59,944
I'm not going to jump the minute he's ready.

517
00:40:59,985 --> 00:41:02,534
Let him stew awhile.

518
00:41:02,575 --> 00:41:04,998
Time is on their side.

519
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:08,507
The longer we let this thing go,
the more explosive it's going to get.

520
00:41:08,549 --> 00:41:10,387
Tell him you'll call them back.

521
00:41:12,183 --> 00:41:13,478
I'll call you back.

522
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:15,859
Just don't take too long, Warden.

523
00:41:17,447 --> 00:41:19,242
He'd better not take too long.

524
00:41:43,302 --> 00:41:44,973
Seven's still in business.

525
00:41:46,519 --> 00:41:48,273
Sure wish I was with 'em.

526
00:41:51,573 --> 00:41:52,952
This slop is rotten!

527
00:42:25,951 --> 00:42:28,875
Attention all towers. This is the Warden.

528
00:42:29,585 --> 00:42:34,222
Listen carefully. Don't do any
shooting unless they hit the wall.

529
00:42:48,298 --> 00:42:50,053
Cell block five.
- Yes, sir.

530
00:42:50,136 --> 00:42:52,392
Have they started yet?
- Yeah, they're on their way.

531
00:42:52,768 --> 00:42:54,398
Well, get them back.

532
00:42:54,398 --> 00:42:57,530
Block four has broken out of the mess
hall. Get yours back whatever you do.

533
00:42:57,530 --> 00:43:00,705
Yes, sir. We've got to get
them back in their cells.

534
00:43:01,164 --> 00:43:02,418
All right.

535
00:43:02,459 --> 00:43:05,341
Back in your cells. Come on.

536
00:43:05,383 --> 00:43:08,140
Come on. Get a move on in there.

537
00:43:20,630 --> 00:43:22,635
Grab a cell. Into your holes.

538
00:43:24,431 --> 00:43:25,809
If they lock you in now, you're dead.

539
00:43:25,851 --> 00:43:28,524
They'll shoot you in your cells.
- Let's go!

540
00:43:45,191 --> 00:43:49,076
X14 to 1734. Ready now. Come in.

541
00:43:49,118 --> 00:43:50,371
State police, come in.

542
00:43:50,413 --> 00:43:51,958
This is Lancing.

543
00:43:52,167 --> 00:43:54,966
Hello, Captain. This is Warden Reynolds.

544
00:43:55,551 --> 00:43:57,263
Standing by, Warden.

545
00:43:57,263 --> 00:43:58,809
We need you right now.

546
00:43:58,851 --> 00:44:01,356
As many men as you can spare.
- Yes, sir.

547
00:44:01,566 --> 00:44:03,403
How soon can you get here, Captain?

548
00:44:03,445 --> 00:44:05,199
I'm on my way.

549
00:44:05,241 --> 00:44:06,244
Good.

550
00:44:09,461 --> 00:44:10,629
Barrett?

551
00:44:10,671 --> 00:44:12,593
Have you put any guards down in the yard?

552
00:44:12,927 --> 00:44:16,436
I already have every man
placed on 24-hour duty.

553
00:44:59,669 --> 00:45:02,594
They're going crazy. I'm getting scared.

554
00:45:02,594 --> 00:45:04,891
Everybody's scared.

555
00:45:28,199 --> 00:45:29,995
The tool house is on fire.

556
00:45:33,797 --> 00:45:35,425
Fire Department.

557
00:45:36,512 --> 00:45:37,807
Fire in the tool shed.

558
00:45:37,932 --> 00:45:40,271
Fire in the tool shed. Let's go.

559
00:46:32,277 --> 00:46:34,824
It's Roberts, cell block five.

560
00:46:34,992 --> 00:46:37,832
Roberts?
- Lifer.

561
00:46:37,874 --> 00:46:39,085
Roberts.
- Yeah.

562
00:46:39,127 --> 00:46:41,299
You can get death in the
state for leading a riot.

563
00:46:41,340 --> 00:46:44,599
I've done 20 years of hard time, Warden.

564
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:46,729
You tell those guys on
the gun walk to lay off.

565
00:46:46,770 --> 00:46:49,778
We'll bring these guards through. Wait.

566
00:46:49,820 --> 00:46:51,073
You tell him.

567
00:46:51,115 --> 00:46:53,705
Warden, these men mean to kill us.

568
00:46:57,339 --> 00:46:58,801
Gun walk.

569
00:47:00,890 --> 00:47:04,983
Gun Walk. Don't do any shooting
when the men come out of five.

570
00:47:06,069 --> 00:47:07,113
19.

571
00:47:09,912 --> 00:47:12,042
19? Tower.

572
00:47:12,085 --> 00:47:14,632
The men are coming out of five.

573
00:47:14,674 --> 00:47:17,222
They have hostages. Let them go.

574
00:48:05,510 --> 00:48:07,807
They want me to open up and let them into 11?

575
00:48:09,018 --> 00:48:10,731
Yes, sir.

576
00:48:18,918 --> 00:48:20,923
Hey, state police are coming.

577
00:48:26,521 --> 00:48:30,029
Why didn't you bring the army
too, you bunch of freaks?!

578
00:48:30,573 --> 00:48:32,578
Yellow bellied rats!

579
00:48:33,538 --> 00:48:34,958
Lousy dogs.

580
00:48:42,519 --> 00:48:44,649
Scram, you lousy cops.

581
00:48:55,886 --> 00:48:58,308
This... This is the Warden speaking.

582
00:48:59,061 --> 00:49:03,571
The state police have orders not to
shoot if you go back to your blocks.

583
00:49:03,864 --> 00:49:06,078
Go back to your blocks!

584
00:49:06,120 --> 00:49:11,091
I appeal to you, for your own sake,
get back into your blocks, men.

585
00:49:11,133 --> 00:49:13,221
Get back into your blocks.

586
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:24,708
Give the OK, Warden, and we'll break this up.

587
00:49:26,044 --> 00:49:28,217
Take over, Captain.

588
00:49:29,511 --> 00:49:32,811
Lieutenant Wilkinson, proceed with plan B.

589
00:50:02,846 --> 00:50:04,056
Dunn on the phone.

590
00:50:06,521 --> 00:50:07,732
Yes, Dunn?

591
00:50:07,774 --> 00:50:10,114
Warden, I'm giving you fair warning.

592
00:50:10,155 --> 00:50:13,455
If any inmate is killed,
one guard for each inmate.

593
00:50:51,885 --> 00:50:53,806
Pick up the man who was shot.

594
00:51:07,299 --> 00:51:09,304
Break them up into two groups.

595
00:51:59,595 --> 00:52:02,938
Damage estimated at over $1 million.

596
00:52:02,938 --> 00:52:06,112
That includes the mess hall,
a fire in the tool shed...

597
00:52:06,237 --> 00:52:08,326
Once they arrived, it didn't take long.

598
00:52:08,452 --> 00:52:09,997
Nobody killed, quite a few injuries.

599
00:52:10,039 --> 00:52:12,503
State police handled themselves well.

600
00:52:12,545 --> 00:52:14,759
The Warden's policy is to avoid bloodshed.

601
00:52:14,968 --> 00:52:17,850
No, it's far from over. 11 still holding out.

602
00:52:18,059 --> 00:52:21,526
Now they have nine hostages.
Five guards from block five.

603
00:52:21,526 --> 00:52:24,450
No report on any of them.
Presume they're still alive.

604
00:52:24,450 --> 00:52:26,622
Haskell seems to be the boss in there...

605
00:52:38,777 --> 00:52:40,532
Yard's clear, Warden.

606
00:52:42,537 --> 00:52:44,542
Barrett, 18.

607
00:52:46,840 --> 00:52:50,390
Warden, Bacon's dead.

608
00:52:50,515 --> 00:52:53,021
Let's have the doctor hold
his report for 24 hours.

609
00:52:53,021 --> 00:52:55,026
We won't release this to the press.

610
00:52:56,572 --> 00:52:58,660
There's 11 again.

611
00:53:00,290 --> 00:53:02,880
Yeah, what is it?
- Warden, I hear Bacon got it.

612
00:53:03,088 --> 00:53:05,595
It was an accident.
- Give it to me straight.

613
00:53:05,928 --> 00:53:08,602
He's dead. Gunshot.

614
00:53:08,643 --> 00:53:10,900
OK, it's like I said.

615
00:53:11,735 --> 00:53:13,406
One for one.

616
00:53:13,615 --> 00:53:16,163
Carnie, get one of the
screws and bring him here.

617
00:53:16,246 --> 00:53:18,460
Snader?
- Snader.

618
00:53:18,543 --> 00:53:20,256
It's a pleasure.
- Dunn!

619
00:53:20,256 --> 00:53:22,011
Listen, Dunn, are you there?

620
00:53:22,345 --> 00:53:24,726
Like I told you, it was an accident.

621
00:53:24,726 --> 00:53:27,023
We didn't kill him, one
of the state policemen did.

622
00:53:27,106 --> 00:53:28,861
We're sticking to our end of the bargain.

623
00:53:28,903 --> 00:53:32,788
Yeah, but Bacon's dead.
Our deal was one for one.

624
00:53:32,955 --> 00:53:34,918
They're going to kill Snader.

625
00:53:35,001 --> 00:53:37,258
Hold it, Dunn, I'm coming right down.

626
00:54:11,718 --> 00:54:12,846
Dunn!

627
00:54:13,807 --> 00:54:14,684
Dunn!

628
00:54:20,281 --> 00:54:22,913
We're ready to listen to the demands.

629
00:54:29,722 --> 00:54:31,559
OK, Warden, I'm ready.

630
00:54:31,643 --> 00:54:33,606
I want to talk to the whole prison.

631
00:54:33,691 --> 00:54:37,784
First, let me see Snader.
- OK.

632
00:54:43,214 --> 00:54:44,884
Have a good look.

633
00:55:19,681 --> 00:55:21,977
We of 11 block

634
00:55:22,396 --> 00:55:24,275
know that we represent

635
00:55:24,526 --> 00:55:28,160
the entire inmate
population in these demands.

636
00:55:28,202 --> 00:55:30,457
We are bargaining for all of you.

637
00:55:31,042 --> 00:55:32,839
Here goes.

638
00:55:36,472 --> 00:55:39,856
11 block must be remodelled.

639
00:55:40,274 --> 00:55:44,869
Give us room to breathe,
and more light to see with.

640
00:55:44,910 --> 00:55:49,212
The nuts are to be separated
from the rest of us and put

641
00:55:49,337 --> 00:55:52,137
some place where you can
do something for them.

642
00:55:52,345 --> 00:55:54,309
Get rid of the leg locks,

643
00:55:54,517 --> 00:55:58,862
chains and brutal guards like Snader.

644
00:55:58,945 --> 00:56:02,914
Teach us a trade, so that
when we get out of here,

645
00:56:03,122 --> 00:56:04,877
we'll be able to hold down a job.

646
00:56:04,877 --> 00:56:07,801
Are you sure you didn't
write these demands yourself?

647
00:56:07,842 --> 00:56:10,725
The whole thing sounds exactly
like your yearly complaints.

648
00:56:10,767 --> 00:56:13,022
Remodel block 11...

649
00:56:13,064 --> 00:56:16,280
The State Commission condemned
that block two years ago.

650
00:56:16,322 --> 00:56:18,202
Inmates read too.

651
00:56:18,787 --> 00:56:20,207
And last,

652
00:56:20,582 --> 00:56:24,175
no reprisals against any ringleaders

653
00:56:25,052 --> 00:56:29,480
or participants of this revolt. That is all.

654
00:56:30,608 --> 00:56:31,694
Well...

655
00:56:31,903 --> 00:56:34,702
You may let them get away with
it, Reynolds, but I promise you,

656
00:56:34,827 --> 00:56:37,500
I'll have these men brought to trial.

657
00:56:37,584 --> 00:56:39,171
If it weren't for those guards,

658
00:56:39,213 --> 00:56:40,884
I wouldn't sign anything and you know it.

659
00:56:40,925 --> 00:56:42,805
Warden, what do you think?

660
00:56:42,847 --> 00:56:45,687
Those demands are awfully
sharp for a bunch of cons.

661
00:56:46,105 --> 00:56:48,444
These are intelligent
men. Dunn in particular.

662
00:56:48,486 --> 00:56:50,742
If he's so smart, what's he doing in here?

663
00:56:50,783 --> 00:56:54,794
He's also a psychopath, like a lot
of brilliant men on the outside.

664
00:56:54,835 --> 00:56:56,924
Are you going to recommend
acceptance for the Governor?

665
00:56:56,965 --> 00:56:59,639
In the main. After all, most of them have

666
00:56:59,680 --> 00:57:01,477
been my demands for a long time.

667
00:57:01,602 --> 00:57:03,607
Looks like this time you might get them.

668
00:57:08,160 --> 00:57:11,585
I want you to sign and I
want the Governor to sign.

669
00:57:15,595 --> 00:57:18,687
I'll sign. I don't know about the Governor.

670
00:57:18,728 --> 00:57:20,608
When will you know?

671
00:57:21,569 --> 00:57:22,989
Give me six hours.

672
00:57:23,867 --> 00:57:25,579
Sure, Warden.

673
00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:54,276
Put him in one of the cells.

674
00:57:57,033 --> 00:57:59,538
Carnie! Carnie!

675
00:58:01,670 --> 00:58:02,965
Carnie!

676
00:58:15,078 --> 00:58:17,543
No. No.

677
00:58:17,751 --> 00:58:18,795
No, no.

678
00:58:25,353 --> 00:58:28,194
Dunn! Carnie, that's enough of that!

679
00:58:30,158 --> 00:58:32,037
He tried to take over.

680
00:58:32,078 --> 00:58:33,791
Throw him out.

681
00:58:35,755 --> 00:58:38,595
Gator, Get me Barrett on the phone.

682
00:58:38,720 --> 00:58:40,224
Take care of him.

683
00:58:40,809 --> 00:58:42,898
Come on, men, put him in a cell.

684
00:58:49,498 --> 00:58:51,168
Easy with him, Al.

685
00:58:54,176 --> 00:58:56,223
Oh, leave me alone.

686
00:58:57,810 --> 00:58:59,815
As far as I can tell, nothing broken.

687
00:58:59,940 --> 00:59:00,943
My neck's stiff.

688
00:59:00,985 --> 00:59:03,993
You're lucky that pipe just
glanced off your shoulder.

689
00:59:06,206 --> 00:59:08,420
You don't look so hot yourself, Al.

690
00:59:08,629 --> 00:59:10,801
I figured you were on Mickey's side.

691
00:59:10,843 --> 00:59:14,101
You figured wrong.
- And you figured wrong when you put Carnie in charge.

692
00:59:14,143 --> 00:59:16,064
If you want the job, it's yours.

693
00:59:17,150 --> 00:59:18,946
Then shut up!

694
00:59:27,301 --> 00:59:28,344
Yes?

695
00:59:28,386 --> 00:59:30,559
We're throwing Mickey out the front gate.

696
00:59:30,601 --> 00:59:33,691
All right. I'll send a
stretcher for Mickey. Who's this?

697
00:59:33,816 --> 00:59:34,986
Mike Carnie.

698
00:59:35,529 --> 00:59:36,699
Where's Dunn?

699
00:59:36,908 --> 00:59:38,746
I'm in charge now.

700
00:59:41,211 --> 00:59:42,798
That was Crazy Mike Carnie.

701
00:59:42,839 --> 00:59:45,011
He's taken over. They've almost
killed one of the inmates.

702
00:59:45,053 --> 00:59:47,184
What happened to Dunn?
- He won't say.

703
00:59:47,309 --> 00:59:51,528
Crazy Mike, who's he?
- Crazy is the nicest thing you can say about him.

704
00:59:52,113 --> 00:59:53,741
Dispensary?
- Yes, sir?

705
00:59:54,326 --> 00:59:56,415
Send a stretcher to 11 block gate.

706
01:00:06,566 --> 01:00:08,529
What's the matter, Snader?

707
01:00:09,448 --> 01:00:12,204
Don't think I like you, huh? You're wrong.

708
01:00:12,664 --> 01:00:14,334
I'm gonna do you a favour.

709
01:00:14,377 --> 01:00:16,549
Wanna say goodbye to your wife?

710
01:00:17,008 --> 01:00:19,014
I'll let you write her a farewell letter.

711
01:00:20,266 --> 01:00:21,394
No.

712
01:00:22,564 --> 01:00:24,903
All the other screws are writing letters.

713
01:00:25,529 --> 01:00:28,203
How would your old lady
feel if she don't get one?

714
01:00:29,414 --> 01:00:31,419
Of course, if you don't want to...

715
01:00:32,297 --> 01:00:34,092
I'll just leave the pencil and paper.

716
01:00:34,302 --> 01:00:37,518
Change your mind, just rap on
the door, Schuyler'll pick it up.

717
01:00:43,784 --> 01:00:46,582
Wait till the wives get those
letters and start to phone the Warden.

718
01:00:47,042 --> 01:00:48,796
You'll see some action.

719
01:00:57,192 --> 01:00:59,114
What a lot of tripe...

720
01:00:59,447 --> 01:01:01,077
"Goodbye for ever. "

721
01:01:01,745 --> 01:01:03,374
Get me operator.

722
01:01:10,057 --> 01:01:13,274
This is Carnie. I want to talk to Mrs Monroe.

723
01:01:17,660 --> 01:01:20,082
The operator says Carnie's
calling Mrs Monroe.

724
01:01:20,125 --> 01:01:22,631
Told them to put the call
through, I'll monitor it here.

725
01:01:22,672 --> 01:01:25,095
Put the call through, we'll cut in.

726
01:01:25,430 --> 01:01:27,936
Find out what this guy's up to.
- Yes?

727
01:01:28,019 --> 01:01:29,732
Mrs Monroe, this is inmate Carnie.

728
01:01:29,774 --> 01:01:31,612
Mike Carnie?

729
01:01:31,654 --> 01:01:36,415
I've got a farewell letter from your husband.
- No, no, he's not dead!

730
01:01:36,959 --> 01:01:38,587
'Not yet.

731
01:01:39,005 --> 01:01:40,509
"Dearest Sue,

732
01:01:40,927 --> 01:01:43,224
"I feel responsible for everything. "

733
01:01:43,307 --> 01:01:45,522
Get me the Governor.

734
01:01:45,522 --> 01:01:47,109
Operator, get the Governor, urgent.

735
01:01:47,150 --> 01:01:50,617
"They tell me I've got to say
goodbye to you and the children.

736
01:01:50,702 --> 01:01:53,625
"I don't know how, because
I can't believe it. "

737
01:01:54,670 --> 01:01:56,340
Convinced?

738
01:01:56,382 --> 01:01:58,429
Just a moment, sir. Ready.

739
01:01:59,348 --> 01:02:01,102
Governor, have you signed yet?

740
01:02:01,269 --> 01:02:02,898
No, I haven't.

741
01:02:02,898 --> 01:02:05,363
These men's lives really depend on it.

742
01:02:05,488 --> 01:02:08,412
You can't trust Carnie.
Governor, if you're going

743
01:02:08,495 --> 01:02:11,587
to sign at all, will you
please do it right away?

744
01:02:11,629 --> 01:02:13,759
I must consider it very carefully.

745
01:02:13,800 --> 01:02:16,474
If I sign, it'll be an open
invitation for the inmates of every

746
01:02:16,558 --> 01:02:20,400
prison in this state to grab a few
guards and dictate their own terms.

747
01:02:20,484 --> 01:02:24,285
Governor, I don't want you
to take the responsibility

748
01:02:24,369 --> 01:02:26,290
for the murder of nine men.

749
01:02:26,374 --> 01:02:28,462
Every minute counts.

750
01:02:31,595 --> 01:02:32,807
He hasn't signed?

751
01:02:32,848 --> 01:02:34,477
Not yet.

752
01:02:35,563 --> 01:02:38,237
What happens if we break into 11 block?

753
01:02:38,278 --> 01:02:42,330
That block is as hard to break into
as it is to break out of. Harder.

754
01:02:42,372 --> 01:02:44,210
Some of my men will be killed.

755
01:02:44,878 --> 01:02:48,888
Suppose we blast a hole in the
block, only inmates get killed?

756
01:02:48,930 --> 01:02:50,685
Casualties will be high.

757
01:02:50,685 --> 01:02:53,024
Including the guards on the inside.

758
01:02:53,400 --> 01:02:54,737
Maybe.

759
01:02:54,778 --> 01:02:58,538
Haskell, the moment you give
the order to blow up that block,

760
01:02:58,580 --> 01:03:01,128
you're in complete charge.

761
01:03:01,170 --> 01:03:05,221
I'll have to take that risk. All
right, captain, let's get started.

762
01:03:14,578 --> 01:03:16,165
Hold your head up a little.

763
01:03:17,377 --> 01:03:19,674
Colonel, do you think us guards

764
01:03:19,716 --> 01:03:21,721
should be killed? We haven't done anything.

765
01:03:21,763 --> 01:03:23,643
Hold quiet.

766
01:03:23,684 --> 01:03:26,148
I never treated the men bad.

767
01:03:26,190 --> 01:03:27,861
No, you just lock up

768
01:03:27,903 --> 01:03:31,537
the cages and help throw
the food to the wild animals.

769
01:03:32,122 --> 01:03:35,296
I never hit nobody.
Didn't play no favourites.

770
01:03:35,380 --> 01:03:37,176
Yeah, you treat us all the same.

771
01:03:38,178 --> 01:03:43,358
A bunch of cons. Each man in
here feels different inside.

772
01:03:43,525 --> 01:03:45,823
We all fight for our identity.

773
01:03:46,031 --> 01:03:47,535
And you help destroy that.

774
01:03:47,661 --> 01:03:49,833
That's the prison. I'm just a guard here!

775
01:03:49,875 --> 01:03:54,344
Yeah, I know. That's what
we've got against you.

776
01:04:00,150 --> 01:04:01,278
Schuyler!

777
01:04:06,959 --> 01:04:09,633
Get me Snader, we'll start with him.

778
01:04:09,633 --> 01:04:11,846
I thought I told you...
- Take off.

779
01:04:11,888 --> 01:04:13,976
And keep your eyes open.

780
01:04:15,898 --> 01:04:20,451
I don't think we should kill 'em.
I don't think God would approve.

781
01:04:20,786 --> 01:04:22,373
How's Al, Tony?

782
01:04:23,041 --> 01:04:24,294
Feeling better.

783
01:04:24,921 --> 01:04:25,881
Talk to him.

784
01:04:25,965 --> 01:04:28,764
See if he and his friend
will stand up against Carnie.

785
01:04:29,223 --> 01:04:32,273
I don't want trouble.
- You can't have it both ways.

786
01:04:32,481 --> 01:04:33,776
If you don't want the guards killed,

787
01:04:33,818 --> 01:04:35,614
you have to put up a fight for it.

788
01:04:36,658 --> 01:04:37,786
Go on.

789
01:04:59,048 --> 01:05:00,594
Hand them over, Schuyler!

790
01:05:04,186 --> 01:05:06,483
What do you guys think you're doing?

791
01:05:07,736 --> 01:05:12,958
I'm willing to let you run this riot, Carnie.

792
01:05:13,166 --> 01:05:16,049
But you can't kill Snader.
- Gator! Boys, come on!

793
01:05:25,656 --> 01:05:29,332
Wait a minute! Let's let Dunn decide this.

794
01:05:31,003 --> 01:05:33,759
All right. Get him.

795
01:05:40,569 --> 01:05:44,579
What's the matter? You guys going chicken?

796
01:05:51,764 --> 01:05:53,769
I want to see Dunn.
- Carnie said no.

797
01:05:53,810 --> 01:05:55,689
I said, I want to see Dunn!

798
01:05:56,776 --> 01:05:59,074
Dunn. Dunn!

799
01:05:59,115 --> 01:06:01,454
Hey, take it easy.
- Carnie's going to kill Snader!

800
01:06:01,454 --> 01:06:03,376
What for? What happened?
- Nothing. He's crazy.

801
01:06:03,501 --> 01:06:06,132
If you don't stop it, we'll
all end up in a bucket.

802
01:06:07,804 --> 01:06:10,101
I told him, no party!

803
01:06:17,787 --> 01:06:20,962
All right, break it up!
Break it up. Break it up.

804
01:06:23,217 --> 01:06:24,972
Break it up. Break it up!

805
01:06:29,315 --> 01:06:31,154
They're going to blow up the block!

806
01:06:32,156 --> 01:06:36,166
What?
- I was standing guard and I see these cops coming across the yard.

807
01:06:36,207 --> 01:06:38,129
They're not planting flowers.
- Where?

808
01:06:38,213 --> 01:06:39,424
Down by the end of the block.

809
01:06:39,466 --> 01:06:41,137
Lock Snader in a cell.

810
01:06:53,292 --> 01:06:55,005
All right, dummy up, dummy up.

811
01:07:07,995 --> 01:07:11,630
It's a double-cross. They're
going to blow a hole in the block.

812
01:07:12,173 --> 01:07:15,139
Carnie, get the screws.
We'll tie them up here.

813
01:07:15,222 --> 01:07:16,935
Right, Gator, you three, come on.

814
01:07:32,265 --> 01:07:34,187
Will you wait for the Governor to sign?

815
01:07:34,228 --> 01:07:35,648
And if he won't sign?

816
01:07:35,857 --> 01:07:37,988
Reynolds, we've tried your way,
it's no good. It started with

817
01:07:38,030 --> 01:07:41,120
four hostages, now they've got
nine. Tomorrow it may be 20.

818
01:07:41,371 --> 01:07:43,460
You've never tried it my way.

819
01:07:43,502 --> 01:07:46,050
The legislature's never
given me the money I need.

820
01:07:46,258 --> 01:07:49,350
If they had, maybe I wouldn't
have a riot on my hands.

821
01:07:49,558 --> 01:07:51,355
I disagree. I think this riot is

822
01:07:51,438 --> 01:07:54,278
a direct result of your policy
of compromise with the convicts.

823
01:07:54,320 --> 01:07:55,907
That's why I'm against the Governor signing.

824
01:07:55,907 --> 01:07:57,537
I'd never sign if it were up to me.

825
01:07:57,870 --> 01:08:00,127
Your way would only make
this place hotter to handle.

826
01:08:00,127 --> 01:08:03,134
You'd get thousands of angry, desperate men,

827
01:08:04,137 --> 01:08:06,475
and they'd take it out on the
public when they're released.

828
01:08:06,517 --> 01:08:09,358
Well, they may be angry,
but they'll be scared too.

829
01:08:09,400 --> 01:08:10,820
They'll know we mean business.

830
01:08:11,990 --> 01:08:13,995
They'll think twice before they riot again.

831
01:08:14,120 --> 01:08:15,331
No.

832
01:08:15,331 --> 01:08:18,715
You'll never stop riots by
treating the prisoners worse.

833
01:08:18,715 --> 01:08:21,722
You'll stop them by treating them better?

834
01:08:57,771 --> 01:09:00,193
Get back in your cells!

835
01:09:00,235 --> 01:09:01,238
Get back in your...

836
01:09:04,663 --> 01:09:06,083
Popped his buttons!

837
01:09:10,135 --> 01:09:12,265
I'm calling the Warden to
tell him we're giving up!

838
01:09:12,349 --> 01:09:13,393
I'm running the show, Colonel.

839
01:09:13,476 --> 01:09:15,523
They blow this cell block,
it'll not only kill the guards,

840
01:09:15,565 --> 01:09:17,361
we'll go with them!

841
01:09:22,206 --> 01:09:23,669
Get that bum in there!

842
01:09:23,753 --> 01:09:26,551
That's what anybody else
gets who tries to sell us out.

843
01:10:25,156 --> 01:10:27,788
You all set?
- Say the word.

844
01:11:08,181 --> 01:11:11,355
This is Dunn. What's up?
- The Warden's on his way down to the yard.

845
01:11:11,564 --> 01:11:16,075
Yeah, but what about the dynamite?
- Nothing's going to happen if you release the guards and come out.

846
01:11:16,117 --> 01:11:18,122
The Governor just signed the demand.

847
01:11:18,456 --> 01:11:21,506
Hey, the Warden's in the yard. They
say the Governor signed the demand!

848
01:11:23,427 --> 01:11:26,184
It's a trick, Dunn.
- No, I'm gonna find out!

849
01:11:41,932 --> 01:11:44,438
I've signed it, so has the Governor.

850
01:11:45,107 --> 01:11:46,986
You wouldn't be playing tricks, Warden?

851
01:11:47,028 --> 01:11:49,492
Like maybe planting a little dynamite?

852
01:11:50,244 --> 01:11:52,792
All the reporters here?
- Yes.

853
01:12:00,478 --> 01:12:02,775
OK, let's give them their headlines.

854
01:12:15,057 --> 01:12:18,398
All right, Dunn. Start
filing out, one by one.

855
01:12:18,440 --> 01:12:20,529
After I see the morning papers.

856
01:12:22,659 --> 01:12:24,580
They'll be here at 7.30.

857
01:12:24,747 --> 01:12:25,708
Fine.

858
01:12:28,089 --> 01:12:29,635
We did it!

859
01:13:34,463 --> 01:13:37,680
All right! Let the guards out first.

860
01:14:33,319 --> 01:14:35,784
I gather, from what you say, Dunn,
that you feel you've won a victory?

861
01:14:35,868 --> 01:14:37,956
That's right.
- Congratulations are in order.

862
01:14:38,123 --> 01:14:39,794
I'll say they are.

863
01:14:54,038 --> 01:14:56,336
I never thought I'd see you again.

864
01:15:17,179 --> 01:15:18,474
Hey, Colonel!

865
01:15:20,019 --> 01:15:21,189
Yeah, Dunn?

866
01:15:21,231 --> 01:15:23,069
I can't understand why
we haven't heard anything.

867
01:15:23,111 --> 01:15:24,531
What do you think they're doing?

868
01:15:26,912 --> 01:15:28,749
Well, it's only two weeks.

869
01:15:28,959 --> 01:15:30,337
Yeah, but nothing's happened.

870
01:15:30,337 --> 01:15:34,347
They're in no rush. Sure, you
forced them, but they don't like it.

871
01:15:34,473 --> 01:15:36,686
They signed it, it's still in the papers.

872
01:15:36,896 --> 01:15:38,232
What's in the papers?

873
01:15:38,441 --> 01:15:42,201
That you lead a riot? That you beat
up a guard and destroyed property?

874
01:15:42,451 --> 01:15:44,372
Yeah, and the headlines say I won!

875
01:15:44,581 --> 01:15:48,382
Yeah, well don't expect any medals.

876
01:15:50,137 --> 01:15:52,392
All right, Dunn, the Warden wants to see you.

877
01:15:52,476 --> 01:15:53,979
It's about time.

878
01:16:02,209 --> 01:16:04,966
I hear the Warden's got the
blueprints for the new 11 block?

879
01:16:07,096 --> 01:16:08,266
There he is now.

880
01:16:23,888 --> 01:16:25,266
Wait outside.

881
01:16:36,002 --> 01:16:37,212
What's it all about, Warden?

882
01:16:38,007 --> 01:16:40,931
Dunn, you're going to stand trial
on charges of leading a riot,

883
01:16:40,972 --> 01:16:43,270
and kidnapping guards.

884
01:16:43,520 --> 01:16:48,407
But I don't get it. No
reprisals. The agreement.

885
01:16:48,533 --> 01:16:50,162
There is no agreement.

886
01:16:50,371 --> 01:16:54,548
State legislature repudiated the
Governor's signature and mine.

887
01:16:54,632 --> 01:16:57,430
They what?
- Cancelled it out.

888
01:16:58,266 --> 01:17:01,357
Said we had no right to make
an agreement with convicts.

889
01:17:02,777 --> 01:17:07,205
But, Warden, you signed
it. You give us your word.

890
01:17:07,414 --> 01:17:09,585
I don't like it, Dunn.

891
01:17:10,129 --> 01:17:11,507
That's what happened.

892
01:17:21,532 --> 01:17:22,910
What will I get?

893
01:17:22,994 --> 01:17:26,795
If you're found guilty, probably 30 years.
- 30 years!

894
01:17:27,004 --> 01:17:28,967
And for what? For nothing!

895
01:17:42,669 --> 01:17:45,092
What will Carnie get, and the Colonel?

896
01:17:45,592 --> 01:17:47,305
Carnie is being sent to a
state mental institution,

897
01:17:47,305 --> 01:17:50,355
where he should have been a long time ago.

898
01:17:51,023 --> 01:17:52,860
I'm signing the Colonel's parole.

899
01:17:55,242 --> 01:17:58,124
And I get 30 years.

900
01:17:58,709 --> 01:18:01,717
Warden, you know I didn't
do it to bust over the walls.

901
01:18:01,758 --> 01:18:04,473
I did it just so people would
know what it's like in here!

902
01:18:04,473 --> 01:18:05,852
But 30 years!

903
01:18:07,355 --> 01:18:10,028
I was never able to transfer Carnie before.

904
01:18:10,990 --> 01:18:14,582
The colonel may not have gotten his
parole, even though he deserved it.

905
01:18:15,626 --> 01:18:20,346
Try to realise, Dunn, that good
does sometimes come out of evil.

906
01:18:21,265 --> 01:18:23,730
That's awful little good for 30 years.

907
01:18:24,148 --> 01:18:27,740
Well, the public has learned
more about the inside of a prison

908
01:18:27,948 --> 01:18:29,452
in the last few weeks than they did

909
01:18:29,661 --> 01:18:32,335
in all my 15 years of making speeches.

910
01:18:33,087 --> 01:18:34,800
Why do you think that is?

911
01:18:35,927 --> 01:18:37,556
Because we got in the papers.

912
01:18:38,517 --> 01:18:40,188
And you're still news,

913
01:18:40,396 --> 01:18:42,401
with or without an agreement.

914
01:18:42,778 --> 01:18:47,038
Haskell wants me to resign. There's
going to be an investigation.

915
01:18:47,748 --> 01:18:50,798
This time, the public will
listen to my side of it.

916
01:18:52,176 --> 01:18:57,105
And they're your only hope.
They're the only ones who can help.

917
01:18:59,570 --> 01:19:01,616
I sure hope so.

918
01:19:01,992 --> 01:19:06,545
I've been in and out of these
joints all my life. And who cares?

919
01:19:06,713 --> 01:19:08,425
That ain't right, Warden.

920
01:19:08,759 --> 01:19:13,563
In other states after their riots,
changes were made. The inmates won.

921
01:19:14,273 --> 01:19:16,069
Yeah, I won...

922
01:19:16,278 --> 01:19:17,949
30 years.
