1
00:03:47,350 --> 00:03:50,602
Oh, God! Oh, my God!

2
00:03:54,321 --> 00:03:57,323
Constables Turner, Davies,
Cunningham and O'Connell,

3
00:03:57,451 --> 00:03:59,576
report to the station
office immediately.

4
00:03:59,705 --> 00:04:03,753
Detective Sergeant Jessard, report to
the detective chief inspector's office.

5
00:04:03,879 --> 00:04:07,832
The detective constable on standby,
report to Detective Inspector Cameron.

6
00:04:07,969 --> 00:04:12,635
Constables Turner, Davies, Cunningham
and O'Connell, report to the station office.

7
00:05:55,701 --> 00:05:57,742
Sergeant.

8
00:06:40,905 --> 00:06:41,901
Here.

9
00:07:04,571 --> 00:07:06,696
- See you. Bye!
- Bye.

10
00:07:59,752 --> 00:08:01,792
Waste of time keeping them out here.

11
00:08:01,923 --> 00:08:04,879
They wouldn't know Christmas
from Pancake Tuesday.

12
00:08:05,011 --> 00:08:07,848
Maybe it frightens him,
knowing we're here.

13
00:08:07,974 --> 00:08:12,439
We've got him so frightened!
Bloody paralytic.

14
00:08:17,032 --> 00:08:20,949
How many kids has he had?
Three of them, and not a bloody smell.

15
00:08:21,081 --> 00:08:26,506
We've got the bugger so frightened,
he'll make it four before the week's out.

16
00:10:32,854 --> 00:10:34,978
I had a chat with Kenny James.

17
00:10:35,108 --> 00:10:39,441
Waste of time talking to Kenny.
It's not his line of country, young kids.

18
00:10:39,574 --> 00:10:43,445
Flashes a bit maybe. Having them off?
Never in a million years.

19
00:10:43,581 --> 00:10:47,119
- It doesn't hurt, talking to him.
- You must be bloody desperate.

20
00:10:47,255 --> 00:10:50,672
- On the house, Mr Johnson.
- We'll pay.

21
00:10:52,889 --> 00:10:54,931
My turn.

22
00:10:57,564 --> 00:11:00,567
- It's a while since I saw Kenny.
- He's been away.

23
00:11:00,695 --> 00:11:03,188
- Not bloody long enough.
- Sergeant.

24
00:11:03,324 --> 00:11:08,239
- Yes, lad. What is it?
- There's another kiddie missing.

25
00:11:08,375 --> 00:11:11,046
He's so bloody frightened!

26
00:11:34,128 --> 00:11:36,917
Most days, the girl walks
home across this common.

27
00:11:37,050 --> 00:11:40,089
Seems likely she did today.
No reason why she shouldn't.

28
00:11:40,222 --> 00:11:43,974
- No reason we know about.
- The parents are not able to help.

29
00:11:44,104 --> 00:11:46,228
Where were they when she left school?

30
00:11:46,358 --> 00:11:49,065
She left school with
two of her friends.

31
00:11:49,197 --> 00:11:52,698
- They went home with their mothers.
- Never bloody learn.

32
00:11:52,827 --> 00:11:56,875
- Janie walked towards the common.
- Nobody tried to stop her?

33
00:11:57,002 --> 00:12:00,005
- "Come home with us"?
- Can we get on with this?

34
00:12:00,132 --> 00:12:04,215
- The longer we stay here talking...
- Do we know what she looks like?

35
00:12:12,237 --> 00:12:16,238
Frank, doesn't she look like the
Corder kid, the first one he got hold of?

36
00:12:16,369 --> 00:12:19,408
- I don't think so.
- Looks to me like they could be sisters.

37
00:12:19,542 --> 00:12:22,829
She was an only child.
Spent a lot of time on her own.

38
00:12:22,964 --> 00:12:26,799
- Too bloody much.
- Any questions?

39
00:12:28,473 --> 00:12:30,598
Right, let's get on.

40
00:15:50,203 --> 00:15:52,743
All right.

41
00:15:52,874 --> 00:15:55,546
It's all right.
I don't want to hurt you.

42
00:15:59,761 --> 00:16:01,922
Over here!

43
00:16:06,983 --> 00:16:09,107
No, no.

44
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:12,523
No! Go away!

45
00:16:12,659 --> 00:16:14,737
No!

46
00:16:14,872 --> 00:16:17,412
- It's all right.
- No!

47
00:16:17,543 --> 00:16:19,537
No, no, no. Janie.

48
00:16:19,671 --> 00:16:23,624
Janie, don't. It's all right.

49
00:16:23,762 --> 00:16:26,469
No, Janie. Please, no. No. No, no.

50
00:16:31,275 --> 00:16:34,148
Janie.

51
00:16:49,724 --> 00:16:53,345
Yes. No, no, no, no.

52
00:17:03,415 --> 00:17:05,705
All right.

53
00:17:06,879 --> 00:17:08,921
That's it.

54
00:17:31,381 --> 00:17:33,256
All right?

55
00:17:57,286 --> 00:17:59,695
Make a way, men.

56
00:18:12,897 --> 00:18:15,472
Make a line, men. Stand back.

57
00:18:26,754 --> 00:18:28,713
Johnny!

58
00:18:34,393 --> 00:18:36,433
No, no, no!

59
00:18:38,345 --> 00:18:39,519
OK. OK. OK.

60
00:18:39,652 --> 00:18:42,821
No! No. No, please.

61
00:18:42,949 --> 00:18:44,943
No! No!

62
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:48,869
- Where are you going?
- Maybe she'll talk.

63
00:18:49,001 --> 00:18:50,876
She's in no state!

64
00:18:51,004 --> 00:18:55,469
Once they get her into hospital,
you won't get near her.

65
00:18:55,596 --> 00:18:57,887
Wait for me.
I'll send someone with you.

66
00:18:58,018 --> 00:19:00,890
Policewoman, would you go along?

67
00:19:22,351 --> 00:19:24,512
Don't, please! No. You won't hurt me?

68
00:19:24,647 --> 00:19:29,646
I won't hurt you, Janie.
I don't want to hurt you.

69
00:19:29,782 --> 00:19:31,859
Well, it does hurt.

70
00:19:32,495 --> 00:19:35,321
It does hurt!

71
00:19:36,168 --> 00:19:40,085
Do you have to? Can't you wait?
Give us a chance.

72
00:21:12,838 --> 00:21:16,838
Sergeant, Mr Lawson says you
should get back to the station.

73
00:21:16,970 --> 00:21:20,638
- He wants to see you.
- The kid is here.

74
00:21:30,201 --> 00:21:35,710
...go immediately to the
incident control room.

75
00:21:35,836 --> 00:21:39,789
Constables on standby,
go to the parade room...

76
00:21:39,926 --> 00:21:44,925
Well, this man approached the girl.
He seemed to be a long way away.

77
00:21:45,060 --> 00:21:47,185
And then...

78
00:21:49,694 --> 00:21:52,863
What's this? You saw
the girl with this man?

79
00:21:52,991 --> 00:21:55,780
- That's right...
- When did you see them?

80
00:21:55,914 --> 00:21:58,073
- Tea time...
- Bloody hours ago!

81
00:21:58,209 --> 00:22:03,503
- The chief inspector's waiting!
- Where the hell have you been?

82
00:22:10,230 --> 00:22:13,352
- "Where the hell have you been?"
- Does she expect a reward?

83
00:22:13,486 --> 00:22:16,275
Coming in here bloody hours late!

84
00:22:16,407 --> 00:22:20,159
- Can she tell us what he looks like?
- Not exactly, no.

85
00:22:20,289 --> 00:22:22,699
- Bloody good sort of lead!
- Hey!

86
00:22:22,836 --> 00:22:25,459
What?

87
00:22:27,678 --> 00:22:29,718
Next.

88
00:22:32,269 --> 00:22:36,519
All right. Is she gonna come up
with something better than this?

89
00:22:36,651 --> 00:22:38,693
It doesn't look very promising, sir.

90
00:22:38,822 --> 00:22:42,408
Any luck with the girl at the hospital,
Sergeant Johnson?

91
00:22:42,537 --> 00:22:44,281
No, sir.

92
00:22:44,415 --> 00:22:48,083
The coat is the best lead.
Puts him up a peg.

93
00:22:48,213 --> 00:22:52,546
You won't find your average layabout
in a coat like she's describing.

94
00:22:52,679 --> 00:22:54,721
No, sir. You won't.

95
00:22:54,850 --> 00:22:58,601
- Put you in mind of somebody?
- No, sir. Not immediately.

96
00:22:58,732 --> 00:23:04,572
That's not like you. Usually rely
on you to come up with something.

97
00:23:04,701 --> 00:23:08,951
Like you say, it's a whole different
kind of fella we've been looking for.

98
00:23:09,083 --> 00:23:13,999
You've no business looking out for some
particular kind of fella. You know that.

99
00:23:14,134 --> 00:23:18,135
You have to reckon it could be anybody
until we know for certain who it is.

100
00:23:18,266 --> 00:23:20,724
Tonight I want you out, all of you,

101
00:23:20,854 --> 00:23:24,023
talking to every likely villain
you can lay your hands on.

102
00:23:24,151 --> 00:23:26,988
People you've already talked to,
talk to them again.

103
00:23:27,115 --> 00:23:29,489
Find yourselves some new faces.

104
00:23:29,619 --> 00:23:32,872
He's out in the open.
He's taking chances.

105
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,754
We'll get him. It's a matter of time.

106
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:37,922
- Mr Cameron.
- Sir?

107
00:23:38,051 --> 00:23:41,719
- I'm going to the hospital. Keep in touch.
- Right.

108
00:23:43,519 --> 00:23:45,928
I want this bugger now,

109
00:23:46,065 --> 00:23:49,519
before he takes some other kid into
the woods and cuts her throat,

110
00:23:49,655 --> 00:23:52,574
like some sort of bloody encore.

111
00:24:35,986 --> 00:24:38,146
OK, sonny.

112
00:25:18,811 --> 00:25:20,687
Billy?

113
00:25:22,151 --> 00:25:24,608
Hang about.

114
00:25:26,867 --> 00:25:30,488
I've been talking to some
people who know you, Billy.

115
00:25:30,623 --> 00:25:33,579
Asking a couple of questions.

116
00:25:36,593 --> 00:25:39,512
You've moved, Billy, haven't you?

117
00:25:39,639 --> 00:25:42,049
I don't know what
you mean, Mr Johnson.

118
00:25:42,186 --> 00:25:47,065
Well, the last time we talked,
didn't you tell me York Street,

119
00:25:47,195 --> 00:25:50,114
you were living on York Street?

120
00:25:50,241 --> 00:25:53,827
- Did I?
- You know bloody well you did.

121
00:25:57,170 --> 00:25:59,793
- Give us a chip.
- I'm taking them home.

122
00:25:59,925 --> 00:26:02,085
Surely you can spare
a couple of chips?!

123
00:26:02,221 --> 00:26:06,056
C-couldn't we get into your car?
If my friends see me...

124
00:26:06,186 --> 00:26:08,679
You've...

125
00:26:08,816 --> 00:26:10,857
got no bloody friends.

126
00:26:36,656 --> 00:26:39,659
Look at that.

127
00:28:06,063 --> 00:28:08,639
Everything all right, sir?

128
00:28:18,961 --> 00:28:21,585
Anything I can do to help?

129
00:28:23,886 --> 00:28:26,843
What is it? What's the matter?

130
00:29:44,194 --> 00:29:45,108
This way, sir.

131
00:30:42,004 --> 00:30:44,044
- How does it look?
- I wouldn't bet on it.

132
00:30:44,175 --> 00:30:47,380
- You wouldn't bet on bloody God.
- Not a betting man.

133
00:30:47,513 --> 00:30:52,760
- Cheerful, aren't you?!
- One of my lads brought him in.

134
00:31:03,833 --> 00:31:06,373
Now, I'm just trying to help you.

135
00:31:07,465 --> 00:31:13,639
You say that you were at the cinema.
You know what time the cinema closes.

136
00:31:14,728 --> 00:31:17,601
- Is it him?
- I don't know. Seems likely it is.

137
00:31:17,733 --> 00:31:21,069
- Bloody Cameron. Have you had a go?
- He's saying nothing.

138
00:31:21,198 --> 00:31:25,032
Barely told us his name -
Kenneth Baxter.

139
00:31:25,163 --> 00:31:27,204
- Do we know him?
- No.

140
00:31:27,333 --> 00:31:31,715
- I'll have a go.
- Cameron was asking where were you.

141
00:31:34,012 --> 00:31:37,181
Tell us what you
were doing, walking...

142
00:31:38,269 --> 00:31:42,686
Baxter, you have to admit,
it looks a bit odd in the circumstances.

143
00:31:42,819 --> 00:31:46,190
- The constable finding you...
- We're trying to be fair.

144
00:31:46,326 --> 00:31:49,743
If you won't help us,
won't even try...

145
00:31:49,873 --> 00:31:54,123
I... I don't know how I'm
supposed to help you, sir.

146
00:31:54,256 --> 00:31:56,499
I don't even know what
all this is about.

147
00:31:56,635 --> 00:32:02,144
- You bloody know, Baxter.
- No, no. I don't know.

148
00:32:02,270 --> 00:32:04,763
Please, you have to believe me.

149
00:32:08,823 --> 00:32:11,363
I... I don't know.

150
00:32:11,536 --> 00:32:13,826
I don't know. I don't know.

151
00:32:14,625 --> 00:32:17,830
We'll wait for the chief inspector.

152
00:32:17,965 --> 00:32:23,128
Maybe he can make you understand,
it does no good refusing to talk.

153
00:32:23,265 --> 00:32:26,968
I've told you. I haven't refused.
I've answered your questions.

154
00:32:27,105 --> 00:32:29,265
You won't listen.

155
00:32:29,401 --> 00:32:33,022
How can I help if you
won't even listen? Huh?

156
00:32:47,016 --> 00:32:51,894
Why... Why won't they listen?

157
00:32:52,024 --> 00:32:55,360
- Are you married?
- Yeah. Yes.

158
00:32:56,782 --> 00:32:59,738
- Got any children?
- Yes.

159
00:32:59,871 --> 00:33:04,501
They'll be worrying -
why aren't you home yet?

160
00:33:15,190 --> 00:33:18,146
- Is it him?
- 60-40 is my bet. Frank?

161
00:33:18,278 --> 00:33:22,326
- Hundred bloody per cent.
- What do you say?

162
00:33:22,452 --> 00:33:25,123
- It seems likely.
- That's him.

163
00:33:25,248 --> 00:33:27,920
Come on, Johnny. You can't know.

164
00:33:28,046 --> 00:33:30,086
I bloody know.

165
00:33:31,510 --> 00:33:35,510
Time was, I'd take your word.
Just now, don't know.

166
00:33:35,642 --> 00:33:40,889
Even you can make mistakes these days.
We'll leave him sweat.

167
00:33:43,364 --> 00:33:47,578
Sweating! He's not sweating.

168
00:33:47,705 --> 00:33:51,242
Laughing! That's him.
Bloody laughing!

169
00:35:16,903 --> 00:35:18,861
- Off you go.
- Sir...

170
00:35:18,991 --> 00:35:22,409
Off you go! I'll take responsibility.

171
00:35:33,475 --> 00:35:37,011
- Brought you a cup of tea.
- I've got nothing to say.

172
00:35:37,147 --> 00:35:40,519
Thought you might be feeling thirsty.

173
00:35:40,653 --> 00:35:45,450
- I won't talk to anybody.
- You don't have to talk. Not to me.

174
00:35:45,579 --> 00:35:49,116
Just thought you might
fancy a cup of tea.

175
00:35:52,508 --> 00:35:55,962
You've no right keeping
me here, no right at all.

176
00:35:56,097 --> 00:35:58,471
People talking to you,
worrying at you.

177
00:35:58,602 --> 00:36:01,521
- Just leave me alone.
- All the time, questions.

178
00:36:01,649 --> 00:36:05,400
- Please, let me sit here?
- Bearing down on you.

179
00:36:05,531 --> 00:36:09,994
- I've got nothing more to say.
- Leaves the throat a bit dry.

180
00:36:10,121 --> 00:36:13,161
Go away, please. Leave me alone.

181
00:36:14,922 --> 00:36:17,676
We can't leave you alone, can we?

182
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:23,809
Thank you, Sergeant.

183
00:36:30,658 --> 00:36:34,410
- I'd be grateful...
- Cameron, I want to talk to you.

184
00:36:34,540 --> 00:36:36,914
I'll call you back.

185
00:36:37,044 --> 00:36:40,213
I'll read you, Baxter,
like an open book.

186
00:36:40,341 --> 00:36:43,178
I'll read you page by page.

187
00:36:43,305 --> 00:36:46,511
It's here. It's written in your face.

188
00:36:46,644 --> 00:36:51,476
Lines, shadows,
marks on your immortal soul.

189
00:36:53,364 --> 00:36:55,822
Your eyes?

190
00:36:57,205 --> 00:37:02,120
I'll look into your eyes and tell you
everything about Kenneth Baxter.

191
00:37:02,255 --> 00:37:05,876
He didn't say anything, sir,
as long as I was with him.

192
00:37:06,012 --> 00:37:09,679
- He's said precious little since.
- You talked to him?

193
00:37:09,810 --> 00:37:12,433
- Yes, I did.
- Couldn't wait.

194
00:37:13,733 --> 00:37:17,022
- All right, Garrett. Good work.
- Thank you, sir.

195
00:37:20,621 --> 00:37:25,999
- Thought you'd get a quick confession.
- I thought it best. Keep him warm.

196
00:37:26,172 --> 00:37:30,220
If he's the bugger we're after,
he's warm enough. Who else had a go?

197
00:37:30,346 --> 00:37:34,976
- Frank was with me.
- Oh, Jessard. Where was Johnny?

198
00:37:35,105 --> 00:37:37,977
He came in a bit later.

199
00:37:38,110 --> 00:37:42,691
A regular tea party! Did you send
out invitations? Come one, come all?

200
00:37:42,827 --> 00:37:46,162
What sort of an inquiry is this?
It's bloody serious.

201
00:37:46,291 --> 00:37:51,087
- Yes. Yes, of course.
- I'm beginning to bloody wonder.

202
00:37:51,216 --> 00:37:53,210
- Who's with him now?
- No one.

203
00:37:53,344 --> 00:37:57,560
Vaughan, keeping an eye on him.
I've told him not to talk to him.

204
00:37:57,686 --> 00:38:00,060
I hope he takes note.

205
00:38:01,568 --> 00:38:06,779
- You want to charge him?
- No. I'd rather, you know, wait.

206
00:38:06,911 --> 00:38:10,447
We have to charge him now or let
him go. Do you want to let him go?

207
00:38:10,584 --> 00:38:13,955
- No.
- Well, make up your bloody mind!

208
00:38:15,050 --> 00:38:18,006
- Has he talked to his solicitor?
- No.

209
00:38:18,138 --> 00:38:22,091
- He knows he can.
- He's been cautioned.

210
00:38:22,229 --> 00:38:25,600
We'll leave him to think for half
an hour, then I'll have a go.

211
00:38:25,735 --> 00:38:30,946
If he doesn't cough and he has got
a solicitor, we'll have to let him go.

212
00:38:31,078 --> 00:38:34,497
We can't keep him sitting
there all night, can we?

213
00:38:34,626 --> 00:38:38,496
You sad sorry little man.

214
00:38:44,894 --> 00:38:49,144
I'm not playing games
with you, Baxter.

215
00:38:49,277 --> 00:38:52,114
I'm not playing games.

216
00:38:53,158 --> 00:38:58,453
Now, you were seen with the girl,
Janie Edmonds, this afternoon.

217
00:38:59,753 --> 00:39:02,922
The other children...

218
00:39:03,050 --> 00:39:06,921
In the morning we'll talk to the other
children concerned in the attacks.

219
00:39:07,057 --> 00:39:10,227
They all described the man clearly.

220
00:39:10,355 --> 00:39:12,848
Quite clearly.

221
00:39:21,833 --> 00:39:23,626
Go on!

222
00:39:23,754 --> 00:39:27,173
Right couple 'ere.
Found them on the common.

223
00:39:27,302 --> 00:39:30,755
- Garrett, you still here?
- Talking to Mr Lawson.

224
00:39:30,891 --> 00:39:34,938
You've got early turn. Get home, lad.
You're no good to us half asleep.

225
00:39:35,065 --> 00:39:38,401
Knocking this fella off?
Ought to be good for a commendation.

226
00:39:38,529 --> 00:39:43,242
If it's the right fella, and they remember
who brought him in. Don't bet on it.

227
00:39:43,372 --> 00:39:45,579
Your names, please...

228
00:39:45,709 --> 00:39:49,710
- Please give your location, over.
- The north side of the square.

229
00:40:03,144 --> 00:40:06,120
No, no! For Christ's sake!

230
00:40:08,791 --> 00:40:11,414
Stand on your own bloody feet.

231
00:40:12,965 --> 00:40:17,678
If I let you go, you'll find yourself
flat on your bloody back!

232
00:40:17,807 --> 00:40:21,225
Bit of a bloody change...
flat on your back!

233
00:40:31,039 --> 00:40:32,415
It's all right.

234
00:40:51,616 --> 00:40:53,860
Get an ambulance.

235
00:41:07,770 --> 00:41:11,723
...Davies, Cunningham and O'Connell,
report to the station office.

236
00:41:11,860 --> 00:41:16,157
Detective Sergeant Jessard, report to
the detective chief inspector's office.

237
00:41:16,284 --> 00:41:20,237
The detective constable on standby,
report to Detective Inspector Cameron.

238
00:41:20,375 --> 00:41:22,535
Constables Turner, Davies...

239
00:41:22,671 --> 00:41:25,080
Sergeant Johnson?

240
00:41:28,389 --> 00:41:30,798
Come along.

241
00:41:51,138 --> 00:41:54,805
- I'll type up my report.
- There's no need.

242
00:41:54,935 --> 00:41:59,067
- It's easily read.
- I'll type it.

243
00:41:59,235 --> 00:42:03,070
There's no way you can keep
him alive by writing about it.

244
00:42:03,826 --> 00:42:06,319
If he's going to die...

245
00:42:06,456 --> 00:42:10,159
Sergeant Johnson,
you are suspended from duty.

246
00:42:10,296 --> 00:42:12,967
Any such period of
suspension may be reckoned

247
00:42:13,093 --> 00:42:16,547
in calculating your
entitlement to pension.

248
00:42:16,682 --> 00:42:19,306
Let me have your warrant card.

249
00:42:24,028 --> 00:42:27,732
- Go to your home now and remain there.
- Sir.

250
00:42:28,662 --> 00:42:31,830
Report back here,
ten o'clock tomorrow morning.

251
00:42:32,419 --> 00:42:35,955
Thank you, Mr Cameron.
I'll take that.

252
00:42:36,092 --> 00:42:38,132
That's all.

253
00:48:42,860 --> 00:48:44,439
Johnny!

254
00:49:02,395 --> 00:49:04,473
What are you doing?

255
00:49:08,448 --> 00:49:10,109
Johnny!

256
00:49:11,703 --> 00:49:15,786
I had an accident.
Broke your bloody china lady.

257
00:49:38,876 --> 00:49:42,128
- You're drunk.
- Not yet.

258
00:49:42,256 --> 00:49:46,471
- I don't know why you come home.
- I keep trying.

259
00:50:26,125 --> 00:50:30,506
- I'll let you get on with it.
- Why don't you stop?!

260
00:50:30,633 --> 00:50:33,126
Will you leave the bloody coat?!

261
00:50:34,474 --> 00:50:40,646
It's possible, see, just possible
that I've killed a man tonight.

262
00:50:45,451 --> 00:50:50,081
Frank's gone with him to the hospital.
You know Frank, Frank Jessard?

263
00:50:50,210 --> 00:50:53,877
- Yes.
- Somebody had to go with the bloke.

264
00:50:54,008 --> 00:50:56,679
Frank went.

265
00:50:58,724 --> 00:51:01,644
Who is he?

266
00:51:01,771 --> 00:51:03,896
He'll be all right.

267
00:51:04,025 --> 00:51:07,148
- I hardly touched him.
- Johnny!

268
00:51:07,281 --> 00:51:11,496
You look such a mess, you know that?
Such a bloody mess!

269
00:51:11,622 --> 00:51:14,827
- Look at you! What happened to you?
- What?

270
00:51:14,961 --> 00:51:17,751
You never used to be a mess.
You didn't used to wear...

271
00:51:17,883 --> 00:51:20,376
- It's warm.
- It bloody well should be.

272
00:51:20,513 --> 00:51:26,353
Looks like an electric blanket tied
with rope. Do something about it!

273
00:51:28,360 --> 00:51:30,401
A bloody mess!

274
00:51:32,951 --> 00:51:35,491
You're no bloody oil
painting yourself!

275
00:51:36,624 --> 00:51:39,331
No, I'm not.

276
00:52:01,335 --> 00:52:03,791
- Tell me about it.
- He got what he deserved.

277
00:52:03,923 --> 00:52:06,130
What did you do?

278
00:52:06,259 --> 00:52:09,132
I hit him. I don't deny it.

279
00:52:09,265 --> 00:52:13,099
Something they all understand,
sweetie, pain.

280
00:52:14,733 --> 00:52:17,273
I've seen it. I know.

281
00:52:18,364 --> 00:52:20,939
You can't talk to them.
They laugh in your face.

282
00:52:21,078 --> 00:52:24,698
I mean, what are they?
Little better than animals.

283
00:52:24,833 --> 00:52:27,540
Any man would understand pain.

284
00:52:27,673 --> 00:52:32,302
- You hurt them, they'll tell you anything.
- Johnny, for pity's sake!

285
00:53:00,689 --> 00:53:02,683
I know.

286
00:53:02,817 --> 00:53:05,357
You... didn't kill him?

287
00:53:06,574 --> 00:53:09,245
Well, he's in the hospital.

288
00:53:10,956 --> 00:53:16,715
- Johnny, love. Don't!
- He had another kiddie, just today.

289
00:53:16,842 --> 00:53:19,880
- Oh, no.
- Janie.

290
00:53:20,014 --> 00:53:22,174
Her name's Janie.

291
00:53:22,310 --> 00:53:24,518
Janie what?

292
00:53:24,648 --> 00:53:26,890
Edmonds. You know her?

293
00:53:27,026 --> 00:53:28,902
No.

294
00:53:30,115 --> 00:53:33,321
She was almost naked
when I found her.

295
00:53:35,291 --> 00:53:38,828
- Did he...?
- Oh, yes.

296
00:53:38,964 --> 00:53:41,802
She's in the hospital...
the same hospital.

297
00:53:41,928 --> 00:53:45,429
- She'll be all right?
- She'll be all right?

298
00:53:45,558 --> 00:53:49,726
Janie will be all right.
She'll be fine. Right as ninepence.

299
00:53:49,858 --> 00:53:54,239
In a couple of days you won't know
the difference. As good as new.

300
00:53:54,366 --> 00:53:57,655
Isn't that something
to be grateful for?

301
00:53:58,748 --> 00:54:03,545
Just, she isn't new, good as new.
She can't be, not again.

302
00:54:03,674 --> 00:54:07,260
He's... He's been there.
He's had her.

303
00:54:07,389 --> 00:54:09,882
- What's the matter?
- She's alive.

304
00:54:10,019 --> 00:54:13,187
But she could be dead.
I've seen them dead.

305
00:54:13,317 --> 00:54:17,981
Remember? The bloke nearly tore
her in half. What was her name?

306
00:54:18,116 --> 00:54:20,324
Dark hair.

307
00:54:22,708 --> 00:54:25,415
I can see her and I can't...

308
00:54:28,801 --> 00:54:31,259
I can't keep everything here.

309
00:54:32,600 --> 00:54:35,437
All the...

310
00:54:35,563 --> 00:54:38,982
all the people,
the things and the death.

311
00:54:39,111 --> 00:54:41,569
Bodies.

312
00:54:41,699 --> 00:54:46,780
Stinking, swollen, black, putrid,
and the smell of death.

313
00:54:52,718 --> 00:54:56,505
White, shattered, splintered bones.

314
00:54:58,144 --> 00:55:01,682
Filthy, swarming, slimy maggots.

315
00:55:02,653 --> 00:55:04,861
In my mind.

316
00:55:07,077 --> 00:55:09,617
Eating my mind.

317
00:55:25,401 --> 00:55:28,404
It's not possible.

318
00:55:28,531 --> 00:55:30,739
Not on my own.

319
00:55:35,294 --> 00:55:37,501
You don't... have to.

320
00:55:38,841 --> 00:55:41,845
Johnny, you're not on your own.

321
00:55:41,972 --> 00:55:43,966
I'm... here.

322
00:55:44,100 --> 00:55:48,183
Please, let me.
I can help. Talk to me.

323
00:55:48,316 --> 00:55:53,944
- I don't want to.
- You must talk to someone, if it'll help.

324
00:55:54,077 --> 00:55:57,448
Why aren't you beautiful?

325
00:55:57,582 --> 00:56:00,539
You're not even pretty.

326
00:56:08,644 --> 00:56:10,851
I never was.

327
00:56:10,981 --> 00:56:13,022
When we got married?

328
00:56:13,151 --> 00:56:16,239
Oh, you said I...

329
00:56:16,366 --> 00:56:20,947
I hoped, for your sake.
I didn't really think so.

330
00:56:22,042 --> 00:56:25,663
Why? Is it important? Would it help?

331
00:56:27,301 --> 00:56:31,931
I wanted something.
I don't know, I...

332
00:56:32,060 --> 00:56:37,900
thought there would be, or should be,
something more, you know?

333
00:56:38,028 --> 00:56:41,235
- Oh, yes.
- I thought it was you.

334
00:56:41,368 --> 00:56:43,576
And I'm not even pretty.

335
00:56:43,705 --> 00:56:45,249
No.

336
00:56:45,375 --> 00:56:47,665
I'm sorry.

337
00:56:52,012 --> 00:56:56,344
The more I drink, it's funny,
the more sober I get.

338
00:57:14,343 --> 00:57:18,640
- Johnny? Talk to me.
- I don't want to talk to you.

339
00:57:18,767 --> 00:57:23,017
- I never have. I made a point of it.
- Who will you talk to?

340
00:57:23,149 --> 00:57:25,821
- Not like some I can mention.
- You stop, you start.

341
00:57:25,946 --> 00:57:28,403
- Chief inspector, for instance.
- Talk to me.

342
00:57:28,534 --> 00:57:32,534
Regular black museum he's got,
in his own front living room.

343
00:57:32,666 --> 00:57:35,919
- "Mementos of my famous cases."
- You shout, you scream!

344
00:57:36,047 --> 00:57:39,216
- I laughed, but he meant it.
- What else is there?

345
00:57:39,345 --> 00:57:43,844
We could go to bed! That's no good.
We never talk in bed.

346
00:57:43,978 --> 00:57:46,815
A couple of minutes at best,
then off to sleep.

347
00:57:46,941 --> 00:57:50,894
Half the time I don't think
you're there at all.

348
00:57:58,920 --> 00:58:01,081
All right.

349
00:58:03,304 --> 00:58:06,260
You wouldn't... choose me,

350
00:58:06,434 --> 00:58:09,639
choose to talk to me,

351
00:58:09,773 --> 00:58:11,933
but I'm here.

352
00:58:12,068 --> 00:58:14,858
I'll listen.

353
00:58:14,990 --> 00:58:17,448
I want...

354
00:58:17,578 --> 00:58:20,997
Please, I want to help.

355
00:58:22,378 --> 00:58:24,420
I can help.

356
00:58:29,015 --> 00:58:33,016
If you could put your
hands into my mind,

357
00:58:33,147 --> 00:58:36,400
hold it, make it stop.

358
00:58:36,529 --> 00:58:38,653
Tell it, "Stop!"

359
00:58:39,450 --> 00:58:45,825
If you could somehow
cut out the thoughts,

360
00:58:45,962 --> 00:58:49,167
the pictures, the noise,

361
00:58:49,300 --> 00:58:55,178
the endless screaming panic.

362
00:58:57,064 --> 00:59:02,525
If you could make silence,
peace, stop.

363
00:59:02,658 --> 00:59:05,365
Oh, if you could...

364
00:59:13,009 --> 00:59:15,087
Talk to me.

365
00:59:20,689 --> 00:59:24,393
A man without a face.

366
00:59:24,529 --> 00:59:27,366
Burnt away, his face - acid.

367
00:59:29,288 --> 00:59:31,578
They tied him to a chair.

368
00:59:31,709 --> 00:59:35,710
He knew, they thought he knew,
something to do with money.

369
00:59:35,841 --> 00:59:38,714
I don't remember.

370
00:59:38,846 --> 00:59:44,604
He was in this room. He had no face.
I didn't know what to do.

371
00:59:44,731 --> 00:59:49,978
I-I didn't know how to make it stop,
the pain, the screaming.

372
00:59:50,116 --> 00:59:52,525
I didn't know.

373
00:59:54,415 --> 00:59:58,665
Red on white... Timmy Miles.

374
00:59:58,798 --> 01:00:04,009
The man had a thin willow cane,
Timmy told us, for naughty boys.

375
01:00:04,140 --> 01:00:08,141
But if Timmy was a good boy,
did what the man told him to do...

376
01:00:08,273 --> 01:00:12,356
Filthy, obscene things,
the man told him.

377
01:00:12,488 --> 01:00:14,815
Things...

378
01:00:14,951 --> 01:00:19,332
He was well spoken,
posh, Timmy thought.

379
01:00:19,459 --> 01:00:22,712
Eight years old,
blue eyes, fair hair cut short.

380
01:00:22,840 --> 01:00:27,091
Fresh complexion, school blazer -
badge on the breast pocket, grey.

381
01:00:27,223 --> 01:00:30,808
Grey trousers, white shirt,
school tie.

382
01:00:30,937 --> 01:00:33,644
Timmy was missing for three days.

383
01:00:33,776 --> 01:00:36,530
The man had him for three days.

384
01:00:39,161 --> 01:00:43,244
She was dead when we found her.
She was dead.

385
01:00:43,376 --> 01:00:46,712
The wheels of the train had cut
one leg off above the knee.

386
01:00:46,840 --> 01:00:50,177
It was still there when we
arrived, beside the line.

387
01:00:50,305 --> 01:00:55,303
The girl was half a mile away.
She crawled after the train had cut...

388
01:00:55,439 --> 01:00:59,938
God knows where she was going.
She didn't get there.

389
01:01:00,072 --> 01:01:04,738
Of course, she wanted to die,
so that was all right.

390
01:01:06,333 --> 01:01:10,084
The girl, she was dead.

391
01:01:10,215 --> 01:01:14,346
She went through the windscreen.
The bloke got the steering wheel.

392
01:01:14,472 --> 01:01:18,889
He was up climbing after the cat.
The railings were there when he fell.

393
01:01:19,022 --> 01:01:21,396
The bloke didn't know
what he was doing.

394
01:01:21,527 --> 01:01:26,108
Used too much jelly on the safe, painted
the walls with his mates and himself.

395
01:01:26,243 --> 01:01:30,113
The girl was pregnant.
And she wasn't married.

396
01:01:30,250 --> 01:01:34,120
Didn't have anyone,
you know, to talk to?

397
01:01:34,257 --> 01:01:38,340
She went into the woods,
deep into this wood...

398
01:01:40,184 --> 01:01:42,677
and hanged herself.

399
01:01:42,814 --> 01:01:46,815
That was in the winter...
November, they reckon, some time.

400
01:01:46,946 --> 01:01:49,902
We cut her down in March.

401
01:01:51,872 --> 01:01:57,214
Running down streets, back alleys.
Standing in doorways, dark corners.

402
01:01:57,340 --> 01:01:59,749
Always night, no one there.

403
01:02:00,846 --> 01:02:04,299
Silent, empty, people dying.

404
01:02:04,435 --> 01:02:07,142
No one. Bloody dying.

405
01:02:07,273 --> 01:02:09,351
No one.

406
01:02:09,486 --> 01:02:11,813
Oh, I've seen it.

407
01:02:14,578 --> 01:02:17,415
Three weeks in the water.

408
01:02:17,541 --> 01:02:21,328
Hung up on a branch.
Hidden under a bush.

409
01:02:21,465 --> 01:02:25,679
There wasn't a lot left. You could tell
it was a baby, but not much else.

410
01:02:25,806 --> 01:02:30,887
Couldn't leave it there,
leave it to rot, go on rotting.

411
01:02:36,408 --> 01:02:39,614
We fished it out.

412
01:02:39,747 --> 01:02:42,454
No sweat, no fuss about the job.

413
01:02:42,585 --> 01:02:45,458
Finding things people have lost,
thrown away.

414
01:02:54,106 --> 01:02:55,934
Sick?

415
01:03:03,998 --> 01:03:07,334
Sorry, love. Sorry I did that to you.

416
01:03:08,506 --> 01:03:14,181
Bloody unfair. No reason you should
have to hear things like that.

417
01:03:14,308 --> 01:03:17,346
- I asked you to tell me.
- You can't tell people.

418
01:03:17,481 --> 01:03:19,521
They just don't understand.

419
01:03:19,650 --> 01:03:24,032
- Tonight was the first time.
- Yes, I know. I'm sorry.

420
01:03:24,159 --> 01:03:27,162
It won't happen again.

421
01:03:27,373 --> 01:03:29,247
Don't!

422
01:03:29,377 --> 01:03:32,629
Please! Don't be nice to me!

423
01:03:32,757 --> 01:03:36,045
- It's my job.
- Don't push me away, shut me out!

424
01:03:36,180 --> 01:03:38,470
It's a job you do on your own.

425
01:03:38,601 --> 01:03:41,474
- Let me help you.
- Look, sweetie. Enough's enough.

426
01:03:41,606 --> 01:03:44,360
- Just go to bed.
- Please let me help you!

427
01:03:44,486 --> 01:03:46,646
Help? Help? Help?

428
01:03:46,782 --> 01:03:51,079
Endless bloody bleating,
like a sheep with a spike stuck up it?!

429
01:03:51,206 --> 01:03:55,420
I don't need your help.
Your help, or anyone's help!

430
01:03:55,547 --> 01:03:58,504
You had your chance.
"Talk to me," you said.

431
01:03:58,636 --> 01:04:00,760
All you had to do was listen.

432
01:04:00,889 --> 01:04:05,354
You couldn't even do that, just hold
that bloody belly just listening.

433
01:04:05,523 --> 01:04:08,146
- Unfair.
- "Talk to me," you said.

434
01:04:08,278 --> 01:04:12,444
"I'll help you," you said. It's all
promises with you, bloody promises.

435
01:04:12,577 --> 01:04:15,496
"I'll make you happy," you said.
You bloody didn't!

436
01:04:15,666 --> 01:04:20,165
I'm here to tell you, Miss Bride
of 1956, you didn't make me happy!

437
01:04:20,299 --> 01:04:22,688
You never have, never once.

438
01:04:23,220 --> 01:04:27,767
If only you'd enjoyed it,
looked up at me, wanted me.

439
01:04:31,402 --> 01:04:33,443
Him!

440
01:04:36,995 --> 01:04:41,078
Him? Is it him you want?
Some sort of bloody pervert?

441
01:04:41,211 --> 01:04:45,294
Would he make you happy?
Would you say "yes, please" to him?

442
01:04:46,887 --> 01:04:49,178
Is that why he laughed?

443
01:04:52,648 --> 01:04:54,891
I hope he's dead.

444
01:04:56,112 --> 01:04:58,153
I wanted him dead.

445
01:04:58,282 --> 01:05:00,657
I thought, "You bastard! Right!"

446
01:05:00,787 --> 01:05:03,077
So I hit him low in the gut,
and he shook.

447
01:05:03,208 --> 01:05:08,799
He won't do that again. He won't take
any more girls in the bushes, have them.

448
01:05:08,926 --> 01:05:13,758
Looking down on their bodies,
white bodies, pressing down on them.

449
01:05:13,893 --> 01:05:18,523
I thought if I had a knife, I'd cut him.
In God's holy name, I'd cut! Cut!

450
01:05:38,352 --> 01:05:40,513
Can we come in?

451
01:05:50,207 --> 01:05:52,913
Oh, I'm... sorry, Mrs Johnson.

452
01:05:53,045 --> 01:05:55,716
I... I didn't realise.

453
01:05:56,676 --> 01:05:57,922
Baxter?

454
01:06:02,646 --> 01:06:05,221
He died in hospital.

455
01:06:06,318 --> 01:06:09,524
You'll have to come
back to the station.

456
01:06:10,618 --> 01:06:13,656
Now.

457
01:06:13,790 --> 01:06:15,998
Right away.

458
01:06:16,127 --> 01:06:18,621
Yes.

459
01:06:18,757 --> 01:06:21,879
Can I...? Have I time?

460
01:06:22,012 --> 01:06:24,684
Yes. All right.

461
01:09:18,279 --> 01:09:22,576
You'd better sit down.
Might have to wait a while.

462
01:09:28,547 --> 01:09:32,493
Yes. Probably going to Beckenham
with a prisoner, over.

463
01:09:35,434 --> 01:09:38,888
Romeo Zero, are you receiving?

464
01:09:39,024 --> 01:09:41,695
The other unit, repeat.

465
01:10:05,278 --> 01:10:08,946
Detective Superintendent Cartwright.

466
01:10:09,076 --> 01:10:11,616
Detective Sergeant Johnson.

467
01:10:11,747 --> 01:10:14,157
Sit down. Sit down.

468
01:10:15,254 --> 01:10:17,332
Have we ever worked
together, Johnson?

469
01:10:17,466 --> 01:10:20,386
No, sir. Not directly.

470
01:10:20,513 --> 01:10:24,383
- How do you mean?
- I was on the McKinlock murder inquiry.

471
01:10:24,520 --> 01:10:27,060
Oh, yes. Of course. I remember.

472
01:10:27,191 --> 01:10:30,194
I was on door-to-door.
You were in charge of my section.

473
01:10:30,322 --> 01:10:33,409
Thought I knew the face.
Couldn't remember the name.

474
01:10:33,536 --> 01:10:36,290
- Well, you know what this is all about.
- Yes, sir.

475
01:10:36,416 --> 01:10:40,916
The deputy chief constable has instructed
me to conduct an inquiry into...

476
01:10:41,050 --> 01:10:44,302
There's no necessity, man. Sit down.

477
01:10:46,976 --> 01:10:51,308
...an inquiry into the events
and death of Kenneth Baxter.

478
01:10:51,443 --> 01:10:56,024
How would you like to start? Tell me
how it happened in your own words?

479
01:10:56,159 --> 01:11:00,207
- As much as you can remember.
- You know what happened.

480
01:11:00,333 --> 01:11:04,547
- I want you to tell me.
- You've been told. They've told you.

481
01:11:04,674 --> 01:11:06,715
I read the report.

482
01:11:06,844 --> 01:11:10,347
You want to compare
what I've got to say?

483
01:11:10,476 --> 01:11:13,432
I don't like this, Johnson,
any more than you do.

484
01:11:13,564 --> 01:11:15,476
I don't like it.

485
01:11:15,610 --> 01:11:18,648
All I'm interested in now
is a preliminary talk,

486
01:11:18,782 --> 01:11:20,907
fill in some of the background.

487
01:11:21,036 --> 01:11:24,039
We'll keep no record of anything
said, unless you feel...

488
01:11:24,166 --> 01:11:27,870
- No, sir.
- I have to listen to your story.

489
01:11:28,006 --> 01:11:31,710
- I'm sorry.
- There's no necessity to apologise.

490
01:11:31,847 --> 01:11:35,764
- I'm sorry you have to listen.
- All right, let's have it difficult.

491
01:11:35,895 --> 01:11:40,145
- Makes no difference to me.
- Well, it is difficult.

492
01:11:41,698 --> 01:11:44,190
Sir!

493
01:11:45,370 --> 01:11:47,780
It is difficult, sir.

494
01:11:50,504 --> 01:11:52,546
Yes, sir.

495
01:11:54,011 --> 01:11:56,586
I have to find out what happened.

496
01:11:56,724 --> 01:12:01,353
I've no opinion. It's just, I have
to find something like the truth.

497
01:12:01,483 --> 01:12:06,825
- I'll tell you the truth.
- What you tell me is the truth.

498
01:12:06,950 --> 01:12:09,027
In this case, the only truth.

499
01:12:11,458 --> 01:12:14,033
You talked to Baxter.
What did you hope to achieve?

500
01:12:14,171 --> 01:12:20,179
I thought talking, him and I alone together,
I thought I might reach him.

501
01:12:20,307 --> 01:12:23,760
- Anyone else talk to him?
- They got nothing.

502
01:12:23,897 --> 01:12:28,313
The more people talked, the more
time went by, the happier he got.

503
01:12:28,446 --> 01:12:31,568
The inspector wanted to leave
him on his own to think.

504
01:12:31,701 --> 01:12:34,159
- You didn't agree?
- He wanted to be left alone.

505
01:12:34,331 --> 01:12:36,906
In your opinion.

506
01:12:38,255 --> 01:12:41,093
You meet him, Baxter,
he's normal enough.

507
01:12:41,219 --> 01:12:43,177
Seems normal enough.

508
01:12:43,305 --> 01:12:46,594
You wouldn't think twice -
solid, respectable.

509
01:12:46,728 --> 01:12:49,019
People know him, like him.

510
01:12:49,150 --> 01:12:53,980
Inside that man, the man laughing
at you, inside is the other man.

511
01:12:54,116 --> 01:12:59,161
The man who fancies schoolgirls.
Right? One hundred per cent right.

512
01:12:59,292 --> 01:13:04,290
When we brought him in, he was covered
in mud. Blood on his trousers. His hands...

513
01:13:13,859 --> 01:13:17,065
His mind was crawling
with pictures of that girl.

514
01:13:17,199 --> 01:13:20,570
All he could see, her naked
body covered in mud.

515
01:13:20,705 --> 01:13:23,874
- I got a hold of him.
- Think what you're saying, man.

516
01:13:24,044 --> 01:13:26,537
Think about it.

517
01:13:26,673 --> 01:13:31,386
I understand your feelings,
case like this.

518
01:13:31,516 --> 01:13:34,009
Sit down, man.

519
01:13:35,104 --> 01:13:36,731
Sit down.

520
01:13:41,909 --> 01:13:46,159
- I don't smoke.
- Wise, very wise. Filthy habit.

521
01:13:47,669 --> 01:13:50,244
Did you say how long you've served?

522
01:13:50,382 --> 01:13:53,089
20 years, sir, almost to the day.

523
01:13:53,220 --> 01:13:56,639
Made detective sergeant
ten years ago.

524
01:13:56,768 --> 01:14:00,769
- First likely candidate Baxter.
- Yes, sir.

525
01:14:00,900 --> 01:14:03,524
Pretty pleased when
you pulled him in.

526
01:14:03,655 --> 01:14:07,952
Evidence, identification, confession,
everyone goes home laughing.

527
01:14:08,079 --> 01:14:10,654
Everyone except Baxter.

528
01:14:10,792 --> 01:14:13,547
Difficult beggar.

529
01:14:13,673 --> 01:14:18,255
- Didn't bother me.
- Something bothers you.

530
01:14:18,389 --> 01:14:22,176
- What?
- Something about Baxter.

531
01:14:22,313 --> 01:14:25,102
No.

532
01:14:25,234 --> 01:14:27,858
- Pretty sure he was the man?
- Yes.

533
01:14:27,989 --> 01:14:31,491
- Instinct?
- I've seen his sort before.

534
01:14:31,621 --> 01:14:34,458
No, not Baxter.

535
01:14:34,584 --> 01:14:37,457
You've never had Baxter in before.

536
01:14:41,222 --> 01:14:42,717
No.

537
01:14:44,518 --> 01:14:48,566
- Any past history?
- Not that I know.

538
01:14:48,692 --> 01:14:53,857
- Has it been checked?
- Nothing around here.

539
01:14:53,993 --> 01:14:56,071
Nothing anywhere.

540
01:14:56,206 --> 01:15:00,456
You know so bloody much,
what's the point in asking me?

541
01:15:02,801 --> 01:15:05,341
Have you worked on cases
like this one before?

542
01:15:05,472 --> 01:15:07,466
Hundred, two hundred.

543
01:15:07,600 --> 01:15:12,313
- What's special about this one?
- Special? Nothing.

544
01:15:14,195 --> 01:15:17,448
It's about a man attacking children.

545
01:15:17,577 --> 01:15:19,701
Girls.

546
01:15:19,831 --> 01:15:21,871
Opening their bodies.

547
01:15:25,132 --> 01:15:28,170
Savaging them.

548
01:15:28,304 --> 01:15:31,093
Virgin blood. Making them stink!

549
01:15:31,225 --> 01:15:33,184
Nothing!

550
01:15:33,313 --> 01:15:35,353
You've read the report!

551
01:15:42,370 --> 01:15:44,994
Yes, I've read the report.

552
01:15:48,547 --> 01:15:50,755
Read worse things, too.

553
01:15:50,885 --> 01:15:52,926
Seen them.

554
01:16:11,046 --> 01:16:14,215
- You don't know for certain he did it.
- He did it.

555
01:16:14,343 --> 01:16:18,260
You don't know! I am not
going to argue with you.

556
01:16:18,392 --> 01:16:20,967
- You can't know.
- I talked to him.

557
01:16:21,105 --> 01:16:24,393
- You were there?
- There was blood on his clothes.

558
01:16:24,528 --> 01:16:28,694
- Even so, unless you saw him...
- His hands were covered in mud.

559
01:16:28,827 --> 01:16:33,540
...watched him assault the girl,
criminally assault...

560
01:16:33,669 --> 01:16:35,579
Yes! All right!

561
01:16:35,714 --> 01:16:37,459
No!

562
01:16:38,886 --> 01:16:42,672
You can't know, in the
sense we use the word.

563
01:16:43,769 --> 01:16:46,523
Forget that and where are you?

564
01:16:50,489 --> 01:16:54,906
What's to stop you
knowing I raped the girl?

565
01:16:55,040 --> 01:17:00,916
What's to stop me knowing you
deliberately, unlawfully and maliciously

566
01:17:01,050 --> 01:17:03,091
beat Kenneth Baxter to death?

567
01:17:03,220 --> 01:17:07,766
No, I didn't. I mean,
I was talking to him.

568
01:17:07,896 --> 01:17:09,688
Nothing.

569
01:17:09,815 --> 01:17:12,771
You haven't listened.

570
01:17:12,904 --> 01:17:15,313
- You can't just walk out.
- Walk out?

571
01:17:15,450 --> 01:17:18,370
- Not listen.
- I'm going nowhere.

572
01:17:22,713 --> 01:17:24,873
- There is more.
- I hope so.

573
01:17:25,009 --> 01:17:27,929
What you've told me so far
doesn't make much of a story.

574
01:17:33,774 --> 01:17:36,314
What's happening to me?

575
01:17:50,178 --> 01:17:52,468
In God's holy name.

576
01:17:54,144 --> 01:17:57,182
I can see...
All I can see are pictures.

577
01:17:57,315 --> 01:18:02,943
In my mind, crowding, ten bloody
million pictures, you know?

578
01:18:05,788 --> 01:18:08,662
Don't you know?

579
01:18:10,964 --> 01:18:14,134
I try to stop them,
keep them somewhere,

580
01:18:14,262 --> 01:18:17,182
in the dark, at the back of my mind.

581
01:18:18,269 --> 01:18:21,722
They won't rest, leave me rest.

582
01:18:23,403 --> 01:18:27,819
All I can see, looking down,

583
01:18:27,952 --> 01:18:30,825
a body, whiteness.

584
01:18:30,957 --> 01:18:32,751
White body.

585
01:18:32,878 --> 01:18:35,252
And him.

586
01:18:36,301 --> 01:18:40,052
Pushing himself, forcing himself.

587
01:18:40,182 --> 01:18:42,473
She screams and screams.

588
01:18:42,603 --> 01:18:44,894
Pressing down on her,

589
01:18:45,024 --> 01:18:47,897
tearing into her screaming.

590
01:18:48,029 --> 01:18:50,736
I can see her hands...

591
01:18:50,868 --> 01:18:53,907
reach up, clutch at his eyes.

592
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:56,709
I can see...

593
01:18:56,837 --> 01:18:59,626
All I can see...

594
01:19:22,423 --> 01:19:24,880
Johnson?

595
01:19:28,809 --> 01:19:32,312
If I were blind, deaf...

596
01:19:34,612 --> 01:19:36,985
I couldn't think.

597
01:19:37,116 --> 01:19:40,238
Come on, man. Pull yourself together.

598
01:19:40,371 --> 01:19:44,621
- Sorry. Sorry, sir.
- Well, there's no necessity.

599
01:19:46,299 --> 01:19:49,337
Things I can't say.

600
01:19:49,471 --> 01:19:52,308
Don't have the words, right words.

601
01:19:52,434 --> 01:19:54,512
Have to find the right bloody words.

602
01:19:54,647 --> 01:19:56,687
Have to tell someone.

603
01:20:00,615 --> 01:20:02,775
Listen...

604
01:20:03,871 --> 01:20:06,079
I think I can tell you.

605
01:20:08,964 --> 01:20:11,253
When I... When I hit him...

606
01:20:11,385 --> 01:20:13,628
- Let go! Let go!
- No, listen!

607
01:20:13,805 --> 01:20:18,305
What are you trying to do?
Burnt my bloody hand.

608
01:20:18,438 --> 01:20:21,691
Are you all right, Johnson?
Huh? Give you a hand.

609
01:20:21,819 --> 01:20:23,860
I'm all right.

610
01:20:25,868 --> 01:20:28,158
- Sorry about that.
- My fault.

611
01:20:28,289 --> 01:20:32,241
- Burnt my hand.
- Must've hurt.

612
01:20:32,379 --> 01:20:35,585
Well, yes. As a matter
of fact, it did.

613
01:21:00,094 --> 01:21:04,095
Doesn't do, brooding on...
well, things like that.

614
01:21:04,228 --> 01:21:07,349
- You can't spend your life...
- How do you stop?

615
01:21:07,483 --> 01:21:13,157
- Keep some part of yourself separate.
- Don't take them home with you?

616
01:21:13,326 --> 01:21:17,327
End of the day, shut them away,
lock the drawer.

617
01:21:17,459 --> 01:21:22,089
- The day never bloody ends.
- You've got to accept you're two people.

618
01:21:22,217 --> 01:21:24,626
- You're lucky, aren't you?
- A police officer.

619
01:21:24,763 --> 01:21:27,885
- Bloody lucky.
- And the bloke you are off duty.

620
01:21:28,019 --> 01:21:33,444
- With your wife, your kids.
- That's how you do it.

621
01:21:33,571 --> 01:21:38,070
- Everyone finds their own way.
- Because you're lucky.

622
01:21:38,203 --> 01:21:42,537
Or is it because you don't have to dig
them out of their dirt graves any more?

623
01:21:42,670 --> 01:21:46,171
Send your inspector, your sergeant,
just don't go yourself.

624
01:21:46,301 --> 01:21:49,589
That's enough, Johnson.
That's more than enough.

625
01:21:49,724 --> 01:21:51,765
Who do you bloody think you are?

626
01:21:51,895 --> 01:21:56,856
I've been soft with you, but there's
a limit, and you just got there.

627
01:21:56,986 --> 01:22:00,025
You're the only one gets
the dirty jobs, are you?

628
01:22:00,159 --> 01:22:05,537
You get special privilege because you
get your share of blood on the walls?

629
01:22:05,668 --> 01:22:07,959
No bloody more than anyone else!

630
01:22:08,089 --> 01:22:13,799
I don't know what went on in that room.
I come here and I want to be fair.

631
01:22:13,933 --> 01:22:16,936
- In God's holy name.
- From the bloody word go!

632
01:22:17,064 --> 01:22:20,185
You don't wanna be fair.
I know what you want.

633
01:22:20,319 --> 01:22:23,905
- Shout and swear from the word go!
- Least said, soonest mended.

634
01:22:24,034 --> 01:22:28,201
You won't help me.
Won't help your bloody self either.

635
01:22:28,333 --> 01:22:31,539
- No one will help me!
- Shut up!

636
01:22:32,841 --> 01:22:35,880
Bloody shut up and listen to me.

637
01:22:36,013 --> 01:22:40,975
You want everyone to carry on the
way you do, I'll bully you bloody sick.

638
01:22:41,106 --> 01:22:43,183
You think you're a hard case?

639
01:22:43,318 --> 01:22:47,900
I was shouting and swearing when you
still wet your bed. I'm not proud of it.

640
01:22:48,034 --> 01:22:52,581
I don't look back and think whatever
it is you think, shouting at me.

641
01:22:52,751 --> 01:22:56,122
I don't have to impress people,
shouting, I've got the rank.

642
01:22:56,257 --> 01:23:00,923
If I want to bully some bloke,
I tell him I'm detective superintendent.

643
01:23:01,057 --> 01:23:05,272
That frightens him. He knows the sort
of man is made detective superintendent.

644
01:23:05,398 --> 01:23:09,779
The man that stays detective sergeant,
running errands, shouting, swearing,

645
01:23:09,906 --> 01:23:13,990
you know that sort of man, Johnson.
You've seen him. You.

646
01:23:14,122 --> 01:23:16,745
Detective sergeant all your life.

647
01:23:22,345 --> 01:23:28,269
One thing... You're right about
one thing. I don't want to be fair.

648
01:23:29,733 --> 01:23:34,731
I came here because I was told to come.
I was told I had to talk to you.

649
01:23:34,867 --> 01:23:40,292
I don't want to talk to you. I don't
want to waste ten seconds on you.

650
01:23:40,418 --> 01:23:44,419
It makes me sick, Johnson,
what you did.

651
01:23:45,511 --> 01:23:48,514
What you are turns my stomach.

652
01:23:57,114 --> 01:23:59,239
Going to help me?

653
01:24:02,749 --> 01:24:07,461
Something like this, I know
it happens. We all know.

654
01:24:26,248 --> 01:24:29,038
Help me.

655
01:24:38,520 --> 01:24:41,192
I'll talk to them.

656
01:24:42,277 --> 01:24:46,230
- You will?
- Can't promise anything.

657
01:24:46,368 --> 01:24:49,620
You'll make him understand?

658
01:24:50,708 --> 01:24:53,545
I can't promise they'll listen.

659
01:24:54,632 --> 01:24:56,673
Make him forgive?

660
01:25:00,810 --> 01:25:03,433
No reason why they should.

661
01:25:06,986 --> 01:25:09,693
Sorry I burnt your hand.

662
01:25:10,785 --> 01:25:16,128
- There's no necessity...
- None at all. It was your own fault.

663
01:25:20,720 --> 01:25:23,046
All the same...

664
01:26:25,625 --> 01:26:27,952
I didn't tell him.

665
01:26:35,016 --> 01:26:39,183
- Brought you a cup of tea.
- I got nothing to say.

666
01:26:42,738 --> 01:26:47,569
You don't have to talk to me.
You don't have to talk to anyone.

667
01:26:47,706 --> 01:26:50,709
Just, don't you think it would
help matters if you did?

668
01:26:50,836 --> 01:26:53,329
- No.
- I don't want the story of your life.

669
01:26:53,466 --> 01:26:56,552
- God, I've got troubles of my own.
- I've told you...

670
01:26:56,679 --> 01:27:03,566
Just one thing. Where did you go
at 3.30 when you left your office?

671
01:27:03,692 --> 01:27:07,277
What did you do till we
picked you up at 10.30?

672
01:27:07,407 --> 01:27:12,452
And how did you find yourself wandering
around town at that time of night?

673
01:27:12,582 --> 01:27:15,205
That's three things, I suppose.

674
01:27:15,338 --> 01:27:18,341
Really all part of the one thing.

675
01:27:18,468 --> 01:27:21,637
What happened to you this afternoon?

676
01:27:23,727 --> 01:27:26,481
I can guess.

677
01:27:26,607 --> 01:27:29,147
I've been in the force 20 years.

678
01:27:29,278 --> 01:27:32,067
The things I've seen...

679
01:27:32,200 --> 01:27:34,775
You're a married man, right?

680
01:27:36,040 --> 01:27:38,663
Two children. 12, 14 - how old?

681
01:27:38,795 --> 01:27:43,959
Linda's 13. Marion's nearly 16 now.

682
01:27:44,096 --> 01:27:47,016
- How long have you been married?
- 18 years.

683
01:27:47,144 --> 01:27:49,767
That's a long time.

684
01:27:49,898 --> 01:27:53,234
I've been married 16 years, myself.

685
01:27:53,362 --> 01:27:58,028
What I'm saying is, you feel like a
young man inside, where it counts.

686
01:27:58,163 --> 01:28:01,284
Doesn't matter what you look like.
It's what you feel, right?

687
01:28:01,418 --> 01:28:03,662
One hundred per cent right.

688
01:28:03,797 --> 01:28:06,088
Now, when you get into bed,

689
01:28:06,218 --> 01:28:09,839
you won't feel any different
now than at, what, 25, 30?

690
01:28:09,975 --> 01:28:13,643
I know I don't. Anything I
could do then, I'll do it now.

691
01:28:13,773 --> 01:28:15,897
Twice over.

692
01:28:17,321 --> 01:28:20,443
They're not interested.

693
01:28:20,577 --> 01:28:23,414
Like they're doing you a favour.

694
01:28:25,251 --> 01:28:30,213
- I'm happily... I'm very happily married.
- Of course you are.

695
01:28:30,385 --> 01:28:33,139
We don't have any
problems of that kind.

696
01:28:33,308 --> 01:28:35,100
No.

697
01:28:35,228 --> 01:28:40,143
- Anyway, I've never thought...
- Never thought? What?

698
01:28:40,278 --> 01:28:42,818
Well, that it...
that was so important.

699
01:28:42,991 --> 01:28:45,745
- There are other things in life.
- Yes.

700
01:28:45,871 --> 01:28:48,162
My wife and I agreed
a long time ago...

701
01:28:48,292 --> 01:28:53,883
14 years ago. You did say
that your youngest was 13.

702
01:28:54,010 --> 01:28:57,180
I don't see what all this
has got to do with it.

703
01:28:57,308 --> 01:28:59,349
What do you do with it?

704
01:28:59,478 --> 01:29:02,018
- Do with what?
- You still fancy a bit.

705
01:29:02,149 --> 01:29:04,940
- I don't understand.
- You've given it up?

706
01:29:05,072 --> 01:29:08,609
- I hear the words but...
- You're not getting it at home.

707
01:29:08,744 --> 01:29:11,701
Have you got a mistress,
a fancy woman, a tart

708
01:29:11,834 --> 01:29:15,751
that gives you a cut
rate for regular visits?

709
01:29:15,883 --> 01:29:20,594
- You think you can get away with this...
- Know, Baxter.

710
01:29:22,018 --> 01:29:25,140
- Bloody know.
- When my solicitor gets here...

711
01:29:25,274 --> 01:29:30,699
Talk for yourself, can't you?
Hiding behind some bloody solicitor.

712
01:29:30,825 --> 01:29:34,696
- What are you frightened of?
- You.

713
01:29:34,832 --> 01:29:37,669
- You've cause enough.
- Yes.

714
01:29:45,601 --> 01:29:48,010
- Tell me about your wife.
- No.

715
01:29:48,147 --> 01:29:51,353
- What sort of woman is she? Past it?
- I won't discuss my wife.

716
01:29:51,487 --> 01:29:55,653
- She's got nothing to do with this.
- Sends you off to bed with a good book?

717
01:29:55,786 --> 01:29:58,623
- Nice hot cup of cocoa...
- I shall report you.

718
01:29:58,749 --> 01:30:01,622
I know the sort of
book you read in bed.

719
01:30:01,755 --> 01:30:04,509
Shut up, for God's sake, will you?

720
01:30:07,556 --> 01:30:10,228
What happened to you?

721
01:30:20,329 --> 01:30:23,118
- You should sit down.
- Take your hands, damn you!

722
01:30:23,251 --> 01:30:26,289
What is it, Baxter,
about people touching you?

723
01:30:26,423 --> 01:30:30,258
Makes you feel what? Dirty? Unclean?

724
01:30:30,388 --> 01:30:32,430
How do you think they feel?

725
01:30:32,559 --> 01:30:38,482
- I won't stay here a minute longer.
- Yes. Oh, yes, you will.

726
01:30:41,575 --> 01:30:44,993
If I want to touch you,
I'll touch you.

727
01:30:50,381 --> 01:30:54,334
We're getting on.
We're making progress.

728
01:30:55,432 --> 01:30:58,851
I'm beginning to know you.

729
01:30:59,940 --> 01:31:03,358
Soon, I'll know what you're thinking.

730
01:31:03,488 --> 01:31:06,111
I'll read you, Baxter,
like an open book.

731
01:31:06,242 --> 01:31:08,533
I'll read you page by page.

732
01:31:08,664 --> 01:31:13,543
It's here. It's written in your face.

733
01:31:13,673 --> 01:31:17,804
Lines and shadows,
marks on your immortal soul.

734
01:31:20,518 --> 01:31:22,643
Your eyes?

735
01:31:24,024 --> 01:31:30,447
I'll look into your eyes and I'll tell
everything about Kenneth Baxter.

736
01:31:30,577 --> 01:31:34,578
I'm watching you, searching you?

737
01:31:36,295 --> 01:31:41,175
My hands, well, they're all over you,
reaching into your secrets.

738
01:31:41,346 --> 01:31:44,967
My fingers, probing.
My eyes, feeling.

739
01:31:45,103 --> 01:31:48,556
I can tell when you sweat.

740
01:31:48,693 --> 01:31:51,364
I can tell when you shiver.

741
01:32:03,260 --> 01:32:05,467
You're sweating now.

742
01:32:08,352 --> 01:32:10,642
I'm going to make you
see what you've done.

743
01:32:10,773 --> 01:32:15,937
I'm going to make you feel
like that little child felt you.

744
01:32:17,034 --> 01:32:20,239
I'm going to make you feel... pain.

745
01:32:23,002 --> 01:32:28,213
You have to feel pain,
pain like she felt, to understand.

746
01:32:28,346 --> 01:32:31,966
To know, yes, to know
what you've done.

747
01:32:32,102 --> 01:32:34,310
Pain!

748
01:32:46,419 --> 01:32:49,672
- Get up.
- Look at it! My hand!

749
01:32:49,800 --> 01:32:53,337
- In God's holy name.
- You've broken it.

750
01:32:53,473 --> 01:32:57,556
Nothing's broken, if that's
what you're worrying about.

751
01:32:57,689 --> 01:33:02,687
- Mad, I think you must be!
- You're the one who's mad, Baxter.

752
01:33:02,823 --> 01:33:06,158
You won't find me chasing girls,
ripping their clothes off.

753
01:33:06,287 --> 01:33:11,498
You won't find me following girls home.
"I've got something to show you."

754
01:33:11,629 --> 01:33:13,375
I know you.

755
01:33:15,678 --> 01:33:18,599
Can't get enough at home.
Don't know what to do with it.

756
01:33:18,726 --> 01:33:23,521
Look at your secretary, think about her:
What would she look like stripped off?

757
01:33:23,650 --> 01:33:28,198
You've got money!
Easy when you've got money.

758
01:33:30,997 --> 01:33:35,543
You, I want you. Come here.
Cash on delivery.

759
01:33:35,672 --> 01:33:38,592
But will you bring it off?

760
01:33:38,719 --> 01:33:43,135
Will you see something in her eyes
that says, "I'll remember you"?

761
01:33:43,268 --> 01:33:45,892
Suppose she just looks at you.

762
01:33:48,027 --> 01:33:51,279
And it's just one face,

763
01:33:51,407 --> 01:33:55,111
one more face in ten million others.

764
01:33:58,129 --> 01:34:01,131
Suppose she doesn't even see you!

765
01:34:12,570 --> 01:34:16,654
You sad sorry little man.

766
01:34:40,912 --> 01:34:44,414
I want to speak to
your superior officer.

767
01:34:46,546 --> 01:34:50,084
- You hear what I say?
- The chief inspector is at the hospital.

768
01:34:50,220 --> 01:34:54,932
- I'll speak to the inspector.
- Stay where you are.

769
01:34:57,650 --> 01:35:01,567
- Don't come near me.
- You think you're getting away with this.

770
01:35:01,740 --> 01:35:07,249
- No, no. Please, no. Don't you...
- You think you're so bloody clever.

771
01:35:07,375 --> 01:35:09,998
A man like you,
you make me feel sick.

772
01:35:10,171 --> 01:35:12,960
I'm frightened. Yes, I'm fri...

773
01:35:13,093 --> 01:35:15,218
I'm frightened of you, is that...?

774
01:35:15,347 --> 01:35:19,514
You walk in here like you own the
bloody world, laying down the law.

775
01:35:19,646 --> 01:35:23,018
- You want this, you want that.
- I'll tell you anything.

776
01:35:23,153 --> 01:35:27,449
Walking out again? Different then.

777
01:35:27,577 --> 01:35:31,708
Will I walk out of here?
Will you let me?

778
01:35:44,523 --> 01:35:48,987
In here, in a room like this room,

779
01:35:49,115 --> 01:35:53,697
you find something about yourself.

780
01:35:53,831 --> 01:35:56,371
You won't let me.

781
01:35:56,502 --> 01:35:58,663
Something like the truth.

782
01:36:05,685 --> 01:36:08,060
All my life, men like you!

783
01:36:11,237 --> 01:36:14,940
- Men!
- I want you to show me the truth.

784
01:36:15,077 --> 01:36:18,033
Men! Women! Boys!

785
01:36:20,253 --> 01:36:25,595
I want you to tell me you're wrong.
"I've done wrong."

786
01:36:29,310 --> 01:36:33,393
God will punish me?

787
01:36:33,526 --> 01:36:38,868
I've gone all my life,
waiting for God to punish me.

788
01:36:38,994 --> 01:36:44,205
Before you leave this room, Baxter,
you'll be begging me to listen.

789
01:36:46,636 --> 01:36:48,587
Oh, yes. Yes.

790
01:36:52,518 --> 01:36:54,761
Yes.

791
01:37:00,657 --> 01:37:04,409
They always go... Thank you.

792
01:37:04,539 --> 01:37:08,076
They always go away, you know.

793
01:37:08,211 --> 01:37:13,043
They always go away.
Ask them and ask them, you know.

794
01:37:13,179 --> 01:37:16,598
Please? Please.

795
01:37:16,727 --> 01:37:20,098
There's something they have
to do, they have to think...

796
01:37:20,233 --> 01:37:23,153
And then,

797
01:37:23,280 --> 01:37:25,524
alone.

798
01:37:25,660 --> 01:37:27,784
Alone.

799
01:37:29,875 --> 01:37:33,923
I've been alone most of my life.
Does that sound strange?

800
01:37:34,049 --> 01:37:36,127
I've got so many friends, you know.

801
01:37:36,262 --> 01:37:40,808
Somehow, I collect friends. People I've
known since school, I still know them.

802
01:37:40,936 --> 01:37:44,474
I didn't like some of them when
I was at school. That's strange.

803
01:37:44,609 --> 01:37:47,731
- People change when they grow up.
- I don't think so.

804
01:37:47,864 --> 01:37:51,283
Those boys, the men I didn't like,
they haven't changed.

805
01:37:51,413 --> 01:37:56,162
One used to bully me. Going to school,
I'd think, "Ooh, he'll be there."

806
01:37:56,297 --> 01:38:01,008
"He'll make me..." The sort of
things they always make you do.

807
01:38:01,139 --> 01:38:06,183
Fetch them milk. Do their homework.
Eat their pudding.

808
01:38:06,314 --> 01:38:10,065
I was sick on the pavement,
I was so afraid.

809
01:38:14,537 --> 01:38:21,256
When we... When we went to play games,
he used to watch me changing.

810
01:38:22,635 --> 01:38:25,922
In the showers,
he used to look at me.

811
01:38:26,057 --> 01:38:30,224
He wasn't... you know. I wasn't.

812
01:38:30,357 --> 01:38:37,278
Just, he looked at me like,
"You haven't got much to boast about."

813
01:38:37,952 --> 01:38:41,122
- You still see him?
- Every so often.

814
01:38:41,250 --> 01:38:47,090
They have dinner with us. He hasn't done
all that well. Hasn't done as well as I have.

815
01:38:47,219 --> 01:38:51,635
One... One thing I didn't
know when I was at school.

816
01:38:51,769 --> 01:38:55,722
Letting him bully me,
make me fetch and carry for him,

817
01:38:55,859 --> 01:39:00,323
shout at me, laugh,
all made it so he needed me.

818
01:39:04,332 --> 01:39:07,751
I... I hated... I hated him.

819
01:39:07,880 --> 01:39:09,922
But he needed me.

820
01:39:10,051 --> 01:39:16,474
He gave me something. He didn't know
he was giving. He thought he had me.

821
01:39:17,982 --> 01:39:22,528
And all the time I was having him.
Don't you think that's strange?

822
01:39:22,656 --> 01:39:24,698
Are you still having him?

823
01:39:24,827 --> 01:39:30,122
I'm still making him pay for every drop
of sweat, every tear, every breath,

824
01:39:30,253 --> 01:39:32,295
and he still doesn't know.

825
01:39:33,175 --> 01:39:38,469
- That gives you pleasure?
- Why not? He had his pleasure then.

826
01:39:39,519 --> 01:39:42,309
- Are there many others?
- Yeah.

827
01:39:42,441 --> 01:39:45,195
Anyone big enough to frighten me,

828
01:39:45,321 --> 01:39:48,278
stupid enough to try.

829
01:39:51,499 --> 01:39:53,647
Was your father a big man?

830
01:40:25,225 --> 01:40:27,800
No, no. Really, no.

831
01:40:27,938 --> 01:40:31,060
- I'm... I'm sorry.
- What's so funny?

832
01:40:31,193 --> 01:40:33,733
No, no, no. Nothing.

833
01:40:34,825 --> 01:40:37,400
Nothing, no, no.

834
01:40:37,538 --> 01:40:44,080
Something's bloody funny. It's the
first time I've seen you laugh tonight.

835
01:40:49,559 --> 01:40:53,476
Don't... No, no,
don't hit me, will you?

836
01:40:53,608 --> 01:40:56,564
You think you're having me?

837
01:41:00,703 --> 01:41:02,947
"Was your father a big man?"

838
01:41:03,083 --> 01:41:06,371
Yes, Doctor. My father
was a big, stupid man.

839
01:41:06,506 --> 01:41:10,855
My mother dug his grave,
dug it deep, and pushed him into it.

840
01:41:15,622 --> 01:41:18,329
What am I laughing at?

841
01:41:18,460 --> 01:41:20,039
You!

842
01:41:20,172 --> 01:41:22,545
You're pathetic!

843
01:41:22,676 --> 01:41:25,216
I'll pull your head
off your shoulders.

844
01:41:25,347 --> 01:41:27,508
I'll break your legs in half.

845
01:41:38,872 --> 01:41:41,993
Before you shout, think.

846
01:41:42,127 --> 01:41:47,587
Who is there? Who's gonna come?
Who's gonna help?

847
01:41:47,720 --> 01:41:51,423
Your wife? After we tell
her what you've done?

848
01:41:51,560 --> 01:41:54,267
Your children?
Children like Janie Edmonds?

849
01:41:54,398 --> 01:41:56,725
Your friends? What friends?

850
01:41:56,861 --> 01:42:02,453
After they read in the papers
the sort of animal you are.

851
01:42:04,458 --> 01:42:07,377
No one will hear.

852
01:42:07,505 --> 01:42:10,841
No one will come. No one will care.

853
01:42:13,099 --> 01:42:16,635
You and me in all the world.

854
01:42:27,164 --> 01:42:30,120
Let go of me.

855
01:42:30,254 --> 01:42:32,662
You and me. You and me. You and me.

856
01:42:32,800 --> 01:42:34,794
You and me, I know.

857
01:42:34,928 --> 01:42:37,468
You, you, you.

858
01:42:37,599 --> 01:42:41,896
You, I know you! And I will have you.

859
01:42:42,066 --> 01:42:44,820
- I'll kill you.
- Yes, I know.

860
01:42:44,946 --> 01:42:47,105
Something. You have to do something.

861
01:42:47,283 --> 01:42:51,070
You filthy bloody little pervert.

862
01:42:51,206 --> 01:42:54,744
- Takes one to know one.
- What will you do with that?

863
01:42:54,880 --> 01:42:58,715
Don't know. Seems like a
good idea, holding on to it.

864
01:42:58,845 --> 01:43:00,674
Right. All right.

865
01:43:00,807 --> 01:43:03,810
Don't want to make it easy.
You wouldn't like that.

866
01:43:03,937 --> 01:43:06,810
- One way or the other.
- The other, any time.

867
01:43:06,942 --> 01:43:10,777
- Funny bloody man.
- I love you, too.

868
01:43:11,326 --> 01:43:14,448
Young lad can get hurt,
playing silly games like that.

869
01:43:14,581 --> 01:43:20,671
What would you do then? Means a lot
to you. You talk about nothing else.

870
01:43:27,312 --> 01:43:29,770
Like Confucius said...

871
01:43:29,900 --> 01:43:33,521
- No more bloody jokes.
- "Lie back and enjoy it."

872
01:43:33,657 --> 01:43:35,900
- Listen!
- You don't even know.

873
01:43:36,035 --> 01:43:40,368
- One last time.
- What a mess you must be.

874
01:43:40,502 --> 01:43:44,966
- Where were you this afternoon?
- I went to the bloody pictures.

875
01:43:46,720 --> 01:43:50,769
Make up your mind!
Like a bloody yo-yo, up and down!

876
01:43:51,479 --> 01:43:53,937
Tell me, Baxter!

877
01:43:54,067 --> 01:44:00,407
Nothing I have done can be one half
as bad as the thoughts in your head.

878
01:44:00,537 --> 01:44:03,623
I wouldn't have your thoughts.

879
01:44:14,102 --> 01:44:18,768
Don't beat me for thoughts in
your head, things you want to do.

880
01:44:18,903 --> 01:44:21,396
I don't have to tell you anything.

881
01:44:21,532 --> 01:44:24,737
You know exactly what it's like.

882
01:44:24,871 --> 01:44:30,499
There's nothing I can say
you haven't imagined.

883
01:44:30,632 --> 01:44:32,672
One day...

884
01:44:39,021 --> 01:44:41,514
Oh, you've found it,
haven't you? Huh?

885
01:44:42,694 --> 01:44:46,647
Something like the truth?

886
01:44:46,826 --> 01:44:49,616
Does it surprise you?
Does it shock you?

887
01:44:49,748 --> 01:44:53,963
It's there in everyone. You must
know that better than anyone.

888
01:44:54,090 --> 01:44:56,498
Surely you know, don't you?

889
01:45:00,851 --> 01:45:03,973
Of course.

890
01:45:04,107 --> 01:45:10,197
You think just everyone else, not you.
Being a policeman, you have to.

891
01:45:10,326 --> 01:45:13,163
20 years thinking you're
different must be a habit.

892
01:45:13,290 --> 01:45:16,079
"Thank God I'm not as other men!"

893
01:45:18,591 --> 01:45:24,134
It's... It's difficult.
It's dangerous.

894
01:45:24,267 --> 01:45:28,268
Cos you're just the same, you see.

895
01:45:28,399 --> 01:45:31,154
Some of you, one hell of a lot worse.

896
01:45:33,617 --> 01:45:36,905
You, for instance.

897
01:46:02,794 --> 01:46:04,787
Come here.

898
01:46:04,922 --> 01:46:08,460
Oh, no, thanks.

899
01:46:08,595 --> 01:46:10,636
Come here.

900
01:46:21,868 --> 01:46:24,243
Thoughts in my head.

901
01:46:26,544 --> 01:46:30,794
Now, don't...
You won't hurt me, please?

902
01:46:30,926 --> 01:46:33,929
You know.

903
01:46:34,056 --> 01:46:38,223
I thought, me and no one else.

904
01:46:41,445 --> 01:46:43,902
Help me, if you can.

905
01:46:44,033 --> 01:46:47,784
If you know, and you can tell me.

906
01:46:49,459 --> 01:46:51,583
Please.

907
01:46:52,756 --> 01:46:57,338
Hasn't always been like now,
like it is all the time.

908
01:47:00,311 --> 01:47:03,065
I can't think,

909
01:47:03,191 --> 01:47:05,766
can't stop thinking.

910
01:47:07,908 --> 01:47:11,160
Is it... like that?

911
01:47:12,917 --> 01:47:19,255
Is it the same for you? Is your
mind full of things all the time?

912
01:47:20,638 --> 01:47:23,261
Thoughts.

913
01:47:23,394 --> 01:47:25,387
Pictures.

914
01:47:25,522 --> 01:47:28,560
Shadows and darkness.

915
01:47:30,239 --> 01:47:33,657
White... Smooth white legs.

916
01:47:34,913 --> 01:47:37,786
Thighs and breasts.

917
01:47:39,964 --> 01:47:42,753
Blood and pain.

918
01:47:43,846 --> 01:47:46,967
You're hurting me.

919
01:47:50,733 --> 01:47:52,858
Help me.

920
01:48:02,211 --> 01:48:04,787
You're hurting me.

921
01:48:07,224 --> 01:48:08,744
Help me!

922
01:48:12,563 --> 01:48:15,352
Help your bloody self, will you?

923
01:48:34,601 --> 01:48:37,439
No! Don't! For Christ's sake!

924
01:48:48,501 --> 01:48:52,798
Every single thing I've ever felt,

925
01:48:53,885 --> 01:48:56,675
wanted to feel,

926
01:48:56,807 --> 01:48:59,596
in one moment.

927
01:48:59,730 --> 01:49:02,056
Hitting him.

928
01:49:04,696 --> 01:49:07,866
I had to hit him again.

929
01:49:07,994 --> 01:49:11,246
Somehow I...
I didn't have any choice.

930
01:49:17,385 --> 01:49:21,053
I wanted what he could give me,

931
01:49:22,519 --> 01:49:26,187
sitting there, letting me hit him.

932
01:49:29,656 --> 01:49:32,446
I wanted that.

933
01:49:33,705 --> 01:49:35,866
He knew.

934
01:49:37,045 --> 01:49:41,259
He was saying, like, "Welcome home."

935
01:49:46,478 --> 01:49:48,518
I had to kill him.

936
01:50:02,131 --> 01:50:04,540
Get an ambulance.

937
01:51:08,664 --> 01:51:10,991
Oh, God!

938
01:51:11,126 --> 01:51:13,168
Oh, my God!
