1
00:00:02,836 --> 00:00:06,090
Do you think of yourself primarily
<i>as</i> a singer or as a poet?

2
00:00:06,715 --> 00:00:09,685
I think of myself more as
a song and dance man, you know?

3
00:00:36,578 --> 00:00:39,957
Do you think you'll stick with folk rock,
or are you going on into more writing?

4
00:00:40,165 --> 00:00:41,792
I don't play folk rock.

5
00:01:46,523 --> 00:01:50,198
Mr. Dylan, I know you dislike labels,
and probably rightly so,

6
00:01:50,319 --> 00:01:56,247
but for those of us who are well over 30,
could you label yourself?

7
00:01:58,535 --> 00:02:01,254
No. I'm just a guitar player. That's all.

8
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:26,480
That's pretty standard for the kinds
of guitars the drummer's channeling.

9
00:02:30,359 --> 00:02:31,485
Still good in 20 years.

10
00:02:31,568 --> 00:02:32,660
Yeah.

11
00:02:42,287 --> 00:02:45,211
Bob called me himself way early

12
00:02:45,582 --> 00:02:47,584
and asked me if I wanted to do it,
and I said, "Of course."

13
00:02:48,126 --> 00:02:50,220
- How are you?
- Good, good.

14
00:02:50,295 --> 00:02:52,423
All of the people there I know,
and we all know each other.

15
00:02:52,506 --> 00:02:53,928
We hardly get to see each other.

16
00:03:42,139 --> 00:03:43,140
Vincent?

17
00:03:44,307 --> 00:03:45,980
You'll sort it out with him.

18
00:03:46,601 --> 00:03:48,854
Rachel wants to talk
but she's on the phone.

19
00:03:48,979 --> 00:03:50,777
This is the law stuff.

20
00:03:51,189 --> 00:03:52,566
Lou, what's your extension?

21
00:03:53,316 --> 00:03:54,317
Yes...

22
00:03:56,153 --> 00:04:00,704
It's the first time that an event
has taken place about an artist.

23
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:03,452
Normally, events take place about events.

24
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:05,503
I remember meeting him
one morning on the street.

25
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:08,756
He lived down on Sullivan Street
in Greenwich Village.

26
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:11,593
And I was rushing off to rehearsal.

27
00:04:11,668 --> 00:04:14,342
I was getting the subway,
we were meeting uptown.

28
00:04:14,671 --> 00:04:16,765
And he stopped me on the street,
and he said, "Hey, man.

29
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:19,684
"Hey, Liam, wrote a song
to Brennan on the Moor last night."

30
00:04:20,469 --> 00:04:22,187
And he said, "I want to sing it for you."

31
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:24,185
Right there in the street,
he starts singing this song,

32
00:04:24,306 --> 00:04:26,525
which went on for about nine or 10 verses.

33
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:28,352
I remember saying to him,

34
00:04:28,852 --> 00:04:32,527
"You've got a fantastic talent
and fantastic imagery.

35
00:04:32,606 --> 00:04:36,327
"If you could squeeze it all in together
and make the songs a bit shorter..."

36
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:40,159
I'd never showed any interest
in anything outside of the blues

37
00:04:40,238 --> 00:04:44,414
until, maybe, I heard Bob,
and that sort of converted me.

38
00:04:44,618 --> 00:04:47,997
The only way you can do it, explain
his contribution, is by playing his songs.

39
00:05:01,218 --> 00:05:02,720
Can you do something real quick?

40
00:05:14,397 --> 00:05:18,368
I was at rehearsal,
and there I was playing guitar,

41
00:05:18,443 --> 00:05:20,912
and I look to my left,
and there's Steve Cropper,

42
00:05:21,112 --> 00:05:22,739
to my right is "Duck" Dunn,

43
00:05:23,448 --> 00:05:26,543
Booker T. is on the keyboard,
I got G.E. Smith.

44
00:05:29,746 --> 00:05:32,750
We had so much fun...
it was one of those things

45
00:05:32,874 --> 00:05:34,968
where it was so much fun,
how could it be legal?

46
00:06:26,177 --> 00:06:28,976
Any song you get a chance to sing,
it's gonna be great.

47
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:30,807
It's gonna be fun, you know?

48
00:06:30,891 --> 00:06:33,269
You just look at the running order list,

49
00:06:33,351 --> 00:06:36,070
and you see all these songs, and, yeah,

50
00:06:36,146 --> 00:06:38,114
there's a lot of songs that aren't on there.

51
00:06:38,189 --> 00:06:41,068
But I think we'd be here
for five years if we did all of them.

52
00:06:41,318 --> 00:06:43,161
Drop with the other color, the opposite end.

53
00:06:46,156 --> 00:06:47,999
- How much would you pay for front seats?
-$150.

54
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:49,041
You came from Dublin.

55
00:06:49,159 --> 00:06:50,160
Dublin, Ireland. Yeah.

56
00:06:51,828 --> 00:06:54,877
I'm sharing a dressing room
with The Clancy Brothers and stuff.

57
00:06:54,998 --> 00:06:56,341
I mean, it's great.

58
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:58,877
Who's got tickets? Hey, over here.

59
00:07:01,171 --> 00:07:02,423
Program here.

60
00:07:02,672 --> 00:07:04,515
You don't play the solo. I play the solo.

61
00:07:04,758 --> 00:07:06,226
I came from Virginia.

62
00:07:06,343 --> 00:07:07,970
I had a problem finding
a ticket out here today.

63
00:07:09,346 --> 00:07:10,814
- Evening.
- Nice to meet you.

64
00:07:15,936 --> 00:07:18,359
I was just fooling around,
getting the idea.

65
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:21,442
I love you, Bob. Want to act?

66
00:07:22,525 --> 00:07:23,822
What do you have like, large, medium?

67
00:07:23,902 --> 00:07:25,825
Only large in white, extra-large.

68
00:07:25,904 --> 00:07:27,201
Large or extra-large, large in white.

69
00:07:29,783 --> 00:07:30,830
Enjoy the show.

70
00:07:31,785 --> 00:07:33,662
All these big, famous guys,
they're all nervous, you know?

71
00:07:33,745 --> 00:07:35,042
They're all going...

72
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:39,259
There's so many artists, and to go out
and sing a song I've never sung before...

73
00:07:39,876 --> 00:07:42,095
Even if I wasn't here,
I'd be watching it on TV.

74
00:07:51,388 --> 00:07:54,517
Here we go. Let's do it.

75
00:07:54,683 --> 00:07:56,230
Ladies and gentlemen,

76
00:07:56,810 --> 00:08:01,031
John Mellencamp
with special guest Al Kooper.
