1
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:14,580
- You did all you could, son.
- You let them catch him.

2
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:18,180
This is you Tom. You get an idea in your
head and everyone else is stupid.

3
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:20,100
I want focused, not fixated.

4
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:26,060
I'm a triple threat -
pathologist, puff, pal of yours.

5
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:28,980
I looked into his eyes
and he just knows. This is the one.

6
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:34,500
I remember what you were like after
Calvert. I won't let you go there.

7
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:37,700
You're losing it, Tom.
Mind you, you lost it years ago.

8
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:40,740
I know you wanted to talk about it
and I never would. I'm sorry.

9
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:42,940
But, Phil, just tell me,
please tell me.

10
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:53,420
It's not that bad. It's just whisky
with cream. Yeah, I know what it is.

11
00:00:56,940 --> 00:00:59,300
To Maureen Thorne.

12
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:03,740
Matriarch, fine musician,
militant republican,

13
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:06,740
and lover of sickly-sweet
dinner liqueurs.

14
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:11,260
She was a good woman,
your mother, y'know.

15
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:13,180
She was always good to me, anyway.

16
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:30,740
Listen, thanks for coming, Phil.
I appreciate it.

17
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:34,420
It would've meant a lot to her
as well, so... thanks.

18
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:39,100
Come on, have a drink with me,
proper drink.

19
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:42,340
We were friends. You fucked it up.

20
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:46,500
Sorry for your loss.

21
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:18,860
(man) 'Day: May 7th.'

22
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:20,780
'St Pancras.'

23
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:25,660
'Victim: Female.'

24
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:27,620
'Young. 20-30.'

25
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:31,940
'Method: Hands only.'

26
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:35,020
'Weapons just for show.'

27
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:37,100
'Take your time.'

28
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:39,060
'One of them will feel right.'

29
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:53,020
'Remember that feeling
the first time.'

30
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:56,380
'How strong you felt.
You were as strong as me.'

31
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:04,820
'Now, pick one.'

32
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:07,420
'Because if you don't...

33
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:09,100
I will.'

34
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:11,060
(bell chimes hour)

35
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:26,060
(woman) Wash your hands
before you touch anything.

36
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:29,020
Bedtime in five minutes,
OK, Charlie?

37
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:46,500
Stop.

38
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:48,460
Please. My husband is just outside.

39
00:03:57,660 --> 00:03:59,620
You can have my bag.

40
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:02,740
Upstairs.

41
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:37,280
Nice holiday, sir?

42
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:41,080
What are you doing here? Sarah Chen.

43
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:44,080
I know who you are. I want to know
what you're doing here.

44
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:48,880
You would've made DI quicker
if you'd stayed in the fraud squad.

45
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:53,600
Ruth Murray. 28. A prostitute.

46
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,440
She lived and worked
in King's Cross, just over there.

47
00:05:56,440 --> 00:06:00,000
Convictions for soliciting.
She was barely covered.

48
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,400
Right, so what does that tell you?
He wanted us to find her.

49
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:10,680
Alright?

50
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:14,360
What are you doing here?

51
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:17,080
Not get two weeks' compassionate
now?

52
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:20,760
Nobody else knows. I'd like
to keep it that way, alright?

53
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:22,760
She was strangled, I think.

54
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:26,040
Skin under her nails
but don't get too excited.

55
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:28,160
Most of it is probably hers.

56
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:32,680
You get that. They scratch at their
necks, trying to stop constriction

57
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:35,320
caused here
by the killer's hands. Probably.

58
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:38,000
Pretty good nails.
Maybe she scratched him too.

59
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,440
What about that bruise there?

60
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,800
That could be caused by his knees

61
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:46,320
if he kneeled over her,
hands around her neck.

62
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:50,080
Any other injuries?
Straight to the point.

63
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:52,600
There's traces of some fluid here
on the face.

64
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:56,560
Semen? It isn't semen, no.

65
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:59,160
I'll have a better idea
when I get back to the lab.

66
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:12,720
(clears throat)
What do you think, sir?

67
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:20,480
Could be anything, couldn't it?
Saliva, sweat, tears.

68
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:23,000
It's on her forehead.

69
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,200
Could be his. His?

70
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:29,800
OK. Some good detective work for you.
Ask Vice what they know about her.

71
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:32,680
Ask around here as well.
Ask some of the girls, OK?

72
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:52,660
Yeah?

73
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:57,420
Yeah, if I wanted a piano,
I would have bought one, alright?

74
00:07:57,420 --> 00:08:00,100
"It'll go lovely in your new flat."
I don't care, Dad.

75
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:02,460
I don't... Dad...

76
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:05,420
Hey, where are you going?
Kerbside delivery.

77
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:08,900
Another 50 and we'll take it
upstairs. Oh, shit.

78
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:17,220
Sir, I've been trying
to get through to you.

79
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:23,220
So no sign of the kid, then?
No. Charlie Turay. Five years old.

80
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:26,820
This initial from the house-to-house
is that the deceased is the mother.

81
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:28,420
Karal, from Sierra Leone.

82
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:31,260
The dad's dead, so...
Traffic thing two years ago.

83
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:35,740
No weapon used.

84
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:40,420
Um, no forced entry,
back door's locked.

85
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:42,820
Likely came in the front
and did it in there.

86
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:47,300
(sighs) There's no evidence
he's been through the house.

87
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:53,980
See you back there.

88
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:56,700
It's angry, right? He knew her.

89
00:08:57,900 --> 00:08:59,860
Well, let's hope so, huh?

90
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:24,260
Charlie?

91
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:29,460
Charlie, it's alright.
He's gone, mate.

92
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:33,780
My name's Tom. I'm a policeman.

93
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:40,420
Come on, Charlie,
you can come out now.

94
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:44,220
You're safe.

95
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:49,980
That's it, good lad.

96
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:51,900
Come on. Mind yourself.

97
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:56,700
OK. Yeah, that's it, that's it.
Good lad.

98
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:58,620
You OK?

99
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:05,860
I'm going to take you outside. I need
you to close your eyes really tight.

100
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:08,420
Alright, mate,
you keep them closed, yeah?

101
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:15,180
Alright, that's it.

102
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:19,860
Alright.

103
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:31,660
OK.

104
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:37,180
Good boy.

105
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:46,140
I need some help here.

106
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:57,940
Sir, Margie Knight.
Colleague of Ruth Murray's.

107
00:12:57,940 --> 00:13:01,740
Says that Ruth was working down
from her at St Pancras that night.

108
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:04,740
Thinks Ruth caught a punter.
Gave us a good description

109
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:07,900
but we've been checking CCTV
and so far, no joy.

110
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:10,260
What time did she spot him?
About six.

111
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:13,020
Check an hour either side. Sir.

112
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:18,060
Did you get anything from Phil
on the fluids found on her face?

113
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:21,620
You were right. It's tears.
Not much chance of DNA off that.

114
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:30,820
Crying on the job, eh?

115
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:42,500
What are you thinking?
Do you think the boy saw anything?

116
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:45,460
He's not saying anything.

117
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:48,900
But even if he didn't see anything,
he would have heard it.

118
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:51,420
(sighs) Then why is he still alive?

119
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:54,060
Did the killer get interrupted,
scared off?

120
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:57,660
See what he did? He would've torn
through the floor if he had to.

121
00:13:57,660 --> 00:13:59,860
Er, guv.

122
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:02,700
You gotta see this.
This is St Pancras CCTV.

123
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:07,740
I was looking for Ruth
but I found this.

124
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:13,420
Why are they there?
This changes everything.

125
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:17,180
So both these women were murdered,
both came in through St Pancras.

126
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:23,460
Ruth Murray died from slow,
sustained squeezing on the artery.

127
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:25,780
Minimal internal damage.
Simple strangle.

128
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:27,700
No weapon used.

129
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:31,660
Karal Turay. No weapon used.

130
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:33,580
Cricoid cartilage crushed,

131
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:36,820
thyroid cartilage unrecognisable,
hyoid fractured,

132
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:40,380
back of her skull shattered as
he beat her head against the floor.

133
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:42,300
With Charlie ten feet away.

134
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:47,660
So I guess we can assume
that this guy wasn't weeping buckets

135
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:50,100
when he killed Karal Turay.

136
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:53,700
So I guess it's a coincidence.
Methods are way different.

137
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:55,700
No. No.

138
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:58,860
Both cases, you have the same
impotent desire, the same end.

139
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:03,100
You can't fuck her, so you kill her.
It's different. Ruth's is some perv.

140
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:07,180
Karal... That's personal, vicious.
Probably someone from her background

141
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:11,940
What about St Pancras? They were
both there, along with 30,000 others

142
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:16,100
Look, it's not enough. All that
connects these two is bad luck.

143
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:19,980
170 murders a year in London,
Say half are women - 85.

144
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:24,660
Say a quarter of them are strangled
and say 70% are below the age of 30.

145
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:26,340
That's 15 women.

146
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:29,980
Add St Pancras, no sexual assault,
and killed within two hours...

147
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:41,140
Thinking, are you, Tom? Or have you
outsourced that these days?

148
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:46,380
What do you think, sir?
Coincidence or connected?

149
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:51,300
It's not a coincidence
if there's a pattern.

150
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:54,740
"You were at the train
station, weren't you, Charlie?"

151
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:58,180
"Why did you go up the escalator?"

152
00:15:58,180 --> 00:16:00,540
He's completely shut down.

153
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:02,500
"Was it because you like trains?"

154
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:06,660
"Do you like these trains, Charlie?"

155
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:14,300
I've gone through the unsolved
murders and attempted murders

156
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:16,780
in Greater London
in the last three years.

157
00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:20,780
There were four killings on one day
in August in Southwark and Lewisham

158
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:24,140
but as far as I can see, two of them
were gang-related stabbings,

159
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:29,020
one was a hit-and-run, the other was
an armed robbery on an off-licence.

160
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:32,940
Double-check those stabbings. I've
triple-checked it. Keep looking.

161
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:41,740
Tom, he's asking for you.

162
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:12,500
You alright, Charlie?

163
00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:18,220
How's everything at the foster home?

164
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:30,060
Where's Mummy?

165
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:34,740
Um...

166
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:55,340
Oh, you're thinking?

167
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:57,940
Sorry, I thought
you were planning on jumping.

168
00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:04,260
What are you still doing here?
I'm not paying overtime. Hm.

169
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:10,500
I'm going out to forget about
Charlie and his mum tonight

170
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:14,260
so I can come back tomorrow
and think about them again.

171
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:16,180
What about you?

172
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:20,700
I'll see you tomorrow.

173
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:25,860
I heard you were difficult.

174
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:37,060
# Went out one night
for to make a little round

175
00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:39,220
# I met my little Sadie
and I shot her down

176
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:43,620
# Went back home and I got into bed,
.44 pistol under my head

177
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:47,260
# Wake up next morning
'bout half past nine

178
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:49,540
# The hacks and the buggies
all standing in line

179
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:51,660
# The gents and the gamblers
standing all around

180
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:55,300
# Taking little Sadie
to her burying ground

181
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:07,300
# Then I begin to think
of what a deed I'd done

182
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:09,540
# I grabbed my hat and away I run

183
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:11,620
# I made a good run
but a little too slow

184
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:14,940
# They overtook me in Jericho

185
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:17,500
# I was standing on a corner
reading a bill

186
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:20,020
# When up stepped the sheriff
from Thomasville

187
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:21,900
# He says, "Young man,
ain't your name Brown?"

188
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:25,060
# "Remember the night
you shot Sadie down?"

189
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:38,780
# That judge and jury
that took their stand

190
00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:40,900
# The judge had the papers
in his right hand

191
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:43,180
# 41 days and 41 nights

192
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:46,540
# 41 years to wear
the ball and the stripes #

193
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:57,860
How did you get in here? Front desk
said you were working late.

194
00:19:57,860 --> 00:19:59,500
For a change.

195
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:01,460
Yeah. What do you want?

196
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:05,180
Had a bit of a busy day.

197
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:07,580
Something about these women
is bugging me.

198
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:09,820
What? It's not one of your hunches,
is it?

199
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:12,580
We all know where
they can lead us to, don't we?

200
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:14,700
Can I take another look?
No, you can't.

201
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:18,860
I'm not doing those kinds of favours
for you any more.

202
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:20,340
Don't you understand?

203
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:23,660
How many more times? I fucked up
and I said I'm sorry!

204
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:25,580
I thought we were through this!

205
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:29,340
We've missed something.

206
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:32,020
Yeah? What did we miss? You know?

207
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:35,780
Hey, if you want to get a look at
their entrails, come back tomorrow.

208
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:39,220
It's driving me mad. I've looked at
every unsolved murder in ten years.

209
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:43,260
I've widened the parameters. Luton,
Chelmsford, Bromley, the suburbs.

210
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:46,580
Every pair of unsolved murders
on the same day. Nothing!

211
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:50,420
Yeah, well, murder in the suburbs
technically isn't murder at all.

212
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:54,260
It's a justifiable reaction
to aesthetic deprivation and golf.

213
00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:56,940
I need your help on this, Phil.

214
00:20:56,940 --> 00:20:58,900
Please.

215
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:02,300
Only unsolved murders, you said.

216
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:06,020
Yeah, why? The police are capable
of charging the wrong man.

217
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:07,740
You know.

218
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:11,860
January, maybe February. Two women,
both stabbed the same day.

219
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:13,460
One was done and dusted.

220
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:16,300
They charged the guy before
I finished my postmortem.

221
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:21,380
Yeah. February 15. Jana Lovik. 22.
Stabbed outside a cinema in Ealing.

222
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:24,620
Single stab wound.
Bladed penetrated the heart.

223
00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:27,420
And the other victim?
Fiona Hutchinson.

224
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:28,860
What?

225
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:30,700
25. Found Thames Barrier Park.

226
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:33,380
23 separate knife wounds.
Partial decapitation.

227
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:35,860
Case still open. Yeah, I know.
No arrests.

228
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:38,820
One a vicious attack,
the other a single knife wound.

229
00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:41,500
One savage, one not,
like those two in there.

230
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:45,460
Knives used - similar.
Neither ever found.

231
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:47,900
They charged Jana Lovik's boyfriend.

232
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:51,060
Arrested Stansted Airport
same night.

233
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:54,740
Always the boyfriend, lazy bastards.
Who was the arresting officer?

234
00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:56,660
Tughan. You're joking?

235
00:21:57,780 --> 00:22:01,740
I suppose it's not impossible to get
from Woolwich to Ealing in that time

236
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:06,020
Why would he do that?
Not he, they. Two killers.

237
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:09,660
Two pairs of victims, same methods,
same day. That's the pattern.

238
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:13,380
Serial killers don't work together.
These ones do.

239
00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:17,860
Look at the state of the place since
I've gone. How you going? Good, sir.

240
00:22:17,860 --> 00:22:20,940
Get yourself a tie, young man.
You're a police officer.

241
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:25,140
Micky, how's the kids?
Youngest one well? Good, fantastic.

242
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:33,380
The Lovik case is done and dusted.
It's as tight as a camel's arse.

243
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:36,220
Pavel Kozinski, the boyfriend.
He's on remand.

244
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:40,180
They had a steaming row in front of
20 witnesses, immortalised on CCTV,

245
00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:43,060
ten minutes later,
she's found dead in the alley.

246
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:47,300
It's always the boyfriend. No, not
always. But in this case it was.

247
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:50,420
He said he left her by the cinema.
When he returned she was dead.

248
00:22:50,420 --> 00:22:54,300
"Oh, my girlfriend's been stabbed.
What shall I do? Call am ambulance?"

249
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:56,660
"No, I'll get on a Squeezy Jet
at Stansted

250
00:22:56,660 --> 00:22:59,260
in case someone thought it was me
that done it!"

251
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:01,020
Even his brief was blushing.

252
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:04,860
I don't think he did do it. No. For
you to be right, I have to be wrong.

253
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:08,420
Tom's got a theory. Yeah, I heard
it. You said. Double trouble.

254
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:11,540
Venables and Thompson, Brady and
Hindley, Harris and Klebold.

255
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:14,140
Ant and Dec, Robson and Jerome,
Donny and Marie,

256
00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:16,180
Mike and Bernie fucking Winters!

257
00:23:16,180 --> 00:23:18,820
You got any evidence, Tom?

258
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:21,940
Nah. You don't need evidence.
You're Tom Thorne.

259
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:25,380
Pavel said he thought she was seeing
someone else. All in his head!

260
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:28,980
The cinema manager said he saw a guy
hanging around, looking scared.

261
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:32,900
No, he said he looked nervous.
We looked into it. Dead end.

262
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:36,860
This guy? Yeah, that's him.
Mr Nobody Knows.

263
00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:40,980
Is that it, Ruth? Is that why
you dragged me across London?

264
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:43,380
This isn't your e-fit.

265
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:46,900
This guy we think killed a prostitute
at St Pancras four days ago.

266
00:23:51,820 --> 00:23:53,780
This is your e-fit.

267
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:59,660
Kevin, you're head of SED 1 West.

268
00:23:59,660 --> 00:24:02,540
It's your jurisdiction.
This is your call.

269
00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:08,220
My call for what? I'd like
to re-interview Pavel Kozinski.

270
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:10,980
Sir.

271
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:13,940
I don't have anything to hide.

272
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:18,180
You argued with Jana because you
thought she was seeing someone else?

273
00:24:18,180 --> 00:24:20,900
I know she was. I told him.

274
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:22,820
Bollocks.

275
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:25,340
We looked into it.
There wasn't anybody else.

276
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:28,380
Why are you so sure
she was seeing someone else?

277
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:32,500
She wanted to break up with me.
I didn't want to lose her.

278
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:34,860
So you killed her? Mr Tughan.

279
00:24:36,460 --> 00:24:38,420
Sorry.

280
00:24:39,460 --> 00:24:41,420
Sorry.

281
00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:45,380
Do you recognise this man, Pavel?

282
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:49,460
He showed me that. I don't know him.

283
00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:52,340
See, the thing is, there was
no defence wounds on Jana,

284
00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:55,100
which suggests it was someone
she knew, which is you -

285
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:57,020
I don't know this man.

286
00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:02,420
OK.

287
00:25:02,420 --> 00:25:05,940
So you had a fight, you went away
and then you came back. Why?

288
00:25:07,780 --> 00:25:09,740
I wanted to say sorry.

289
00:25:10,540 --> 00:25:12,500
To make it alright.

290
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:17,260
People said you were shouting
in her face, saying, um...

291
00:25:17,260 --> 00:25:19,620
"Dziwka." What's that?

292
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:21,580
Whore.

293
00:25:23,780 --> 00:25:26,740
I didn't kill her.

294
00:25:26,740 --> 00:25:30,500
Dziwka. I must remember that.
It'll come in handy.

295
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:33,620
What about their other friends?
People at the church?

296
00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:35,500
She wasn't seeing anyone else.

297
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:38,260
She wanted to get away
from that jealous fucker.

298
00:25:38,260 --> 00:25:42,100
By all accounts, she was a decent
girl. She worked, slept and prayed.

299
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:46,140
What about the people at work? Tom,
the man who did it is right there.

300
00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:48,980
She worked at a hotel, yeah?
You mind if I dig around?

301
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:52,380
If you like.

302
00:25:55,460 --> 00:25:57,500
You know, I can't imagine it.

303
00:25:57,500 --> 00:26:01,380
To lose it that much that you take
another human being's life.

304
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:03,820
But it does happen
every now and again.

305
00:26:03,820 --> 00:26:05,740
Thank you.

306
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:30,180
Fiona Hutchinson.

307
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:32,980
Her run took east past
the Albert Dock and back here.

308
00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:35,340
Every Sunday, same time, same route.

309
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:40,060
It could've been a chance encounter
or he could've scoped her. (sniffs)

310
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:41,580
You look like shit.

311
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:43,340
Thank you!

312
00:26:44,380 --> 00:26:47,940
Do you have a problem with the way
I look? Not if you turn up on time.

313
00:26:50,420 --> 00:26:53,460
You are with us, though, yeah?
Where was the body found?

314
00:26:56,540 --> 00:26:58,500
Just down there.

315
00:26:59,380 --> 00:27:00,500
No witnesses.

316
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:05,460
Three degrees on a dank Sunday in
February. Hardly a tourist Mecca.

317
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:09,420
What about the CCTV?
Er, the entrance, the cafe.

318
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:12,220
But very little of the park
is actually covered.

319
00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:14,340
We've got her coming in
but that's it.

320
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:17,820
We're hardly likely
to have her coming out, are we?

321
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:19,860
Her body was discovered just here.

322
00:27:23,540 --> 00:27:25,500
(woman breathing quickly)

323
00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:32,900
12, 13, 14...

324
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:34,860
23 stab wounds.

325
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:37,660
Yeah, but only 14 to kill her.

326
00:27:39,740 --> 00:27:41,700
The rest were postmortem.

327
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:49,580
We ran background checks
on all the staff.

328
00:27:49,580 --> 00:27:53,300
It turns out the hotel manager
was interviewed two years ago -

329
00:27:53,300 --> 00:27:55,860
get this -
for a series of sexual assaults.

330
00:27:55,860 --> 00:27:58,220
Someone was getting access
to hotel rooms.

331
00:27:58,220 --> 00:28:00,820
The investigating officer
was 100% convinced

332
00:28:00,820 --> 00:28:05,100
it was two guys working together and
the hotel manager was the rapist.

333
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:08,900
Jana Lovik was murdered while she
was working here. Maybe this is him.

334
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:12,220
Sean Bracher.

335
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:17,940
He doesn't match the e-fit. He's
the other guy. It's a team, right?

336
00:28:19,820 --> 00:28:21,860
Tom wants me to tag him.

337
00:28:21,860 --> 00:28:26,700
You interview him, maybe he'll
panic, lead us to his partner.

338
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:28,820
What d'you reckon?

339
00:28:28,820 --> 00:28:31,340
You up for it?
Bet you he could be our psycho.

340
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:39,900
Look, Sarah, we can do this
the other way round.

341
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:42,420
I don't mind doing the interview.
No. I'm fine.

342
00:28:44,980 --> 00:28:46,940
Just make sure that tracker works.

343
00:28:56,220 --> 00:28:58,860
I thought you had the guy,
Jana's boyfriend.

344
00:29:00,220 --> 00:29:03,500
It's been suggested
Jana was seeing someone.

345
00:29:04,820 --> 00:29:06,380
Someone from work?

346
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:14,100
Was she a bit naive? A bit needy?

347
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:21,100
Look, I didn't take advantage of her
if that's what you're trying to say.

348
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:24,020
But you did sleep with her.

349
00:29:27,380 --> 00:29:29,340
You're sure this is all necessary?

350
00:29:30,340 --> 00:29:34,180
Jana's death was a... horrible thing
for us all here.

351
00:29:35,820 --> 00:29:39,020
We're just trying
to put it behind us.

352
00:29:56,740 --> 00:30:00,420
Alright, Mr Bracher.
That's been very helpful.

353
00:30:00,420 --> 00:30:02,340
That's it? Mm-hm.

354
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:05,300
Please, um, call me...

355
00:30:07,780 --> 00:30:11,220
...if there's anything else
you think I should know. Will do.

356
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:13,140
Alright.

357
00:30:30,860 --> 00:30:34,260
Martin, we may have a problem.

358
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:10,520
Martin?

359
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:02,960
'Time for some spring cleaning,
Martin.'

360
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:07,720
'There are witnesses.' (groans)

361
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:11,080
'Oh, and keep your eyes open
this time.'

362
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:16,400
'I want you to get
the full experience.' (groans)

363
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:22,200
'Can't have any witnesses, Martin.'

364
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:34,080
Yeah, sorry, work's been a bit...

365
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:36,720
Fine.

366
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,160
You wouldn't believe
what she's kept.

367
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:47,600
There's all your old school reports,
loads of photos.

368
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:49,520
Of you and your mum.

369
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:52,480
Something to remember her by.

370
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:58,200
I do remember her, Dad. Every time I
look at that bloody piano you sent me

371
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:02,120
You and her were the musical ones.

372
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:06,160
I wasn't musical, Dad.

373
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:09,640
I used to listen to records,
remember? Hank Williams, all that.

374
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:12,320
The place were always full o' music.

375
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:16,760
I've got Sky now. Thank God.

376
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:21,880
Where shall I put this?

377
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:26,520
What? You've forgotten, haven't you?

378
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:28,480
That I was coming round.

379
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:31,960
Yeah, yeah, I'm sorry.

380
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:34,440
We've had a lot on our minds.

381
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:47,960
Seen the paper?

382
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:51,720
Come on, I'll take over. Isn't
surveillance above your pay rate?

383
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:53,800
I want to get a proper look
at Bracher.

384
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:56,160
What time is his break?
Not for another hour.

385
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:59,880
Come on, back to the little wifey.

386
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:44,120
Police. Can you let us out, mate?

387
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:22,720
Fuck! Get in here!

388
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:27,040
What are you doing?!

389
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:28,960
Sean Bracher! I am arresting you

390
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:31,840
on suspicion of the murder of
Karal Turay and Fiona Hutchinson!

391
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:33,760
Who? Who lives here?!

392
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:44,000
(children's TV on)

393
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:03,360
Alright, you got Chas. Where's Dave?

394
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:06,600
He didn't turn up for work
this morning.

395
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:09,880
He saw his mug in the paper
and did a run for it.

396
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:11,680
I bet he knows where he is.

397
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:13,640
I don't think he does.

398
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:17,040
Don't do this to me, Tom.

399
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:19,720
Says he went to Palmer's flat
to get computer drives.

400
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:21,920
Palmer was helping him
fiddle the books.

401
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:25,440
Said he saw Palmer's picture in
the paper, wanted to get the disks.

402
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:28,800
What's on 'em? Accounts,
spreadsheets, hotel invoicing,

403
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:29,880
just like he said.

404
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:34,800
Alright. So he's on the fiddle.
Doesn't mean he's not a murderer.

405
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:18,640
How is she? They've just told us
she's in ICU.

406
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:20,840
Critical but not life threatening.

407
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:24,200
DSG unit's arrived at the station,
sir. You two brief them.

408
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:27,720
Is he down here? Yeah, up there.
Meet me at the car. I'll meet you.

409
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:30,120
Charlie.

410
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:33,720
You OK?

411
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:37,160
Listen, we're going to take you
somewhere a bit safer.

412
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:39,080
Are you coming?

413
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:41,640
Yeah.

414
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:43,600
Thanks.

415
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:50,440
Miss?

416
00:40:56,680 --> 00:40:58,800
I'm the one...

417
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:00,760
you're looking for. I did it.

418
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:10,120
I killed her. It was me.

419
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,880
I'll take it.

420
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:19,200
It's OK.

421
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:22,200
Drop the gun and get down!
Hands behind your head!

422
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:24,480
Put your hands behind your head!
(thud!)

423
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:26,400
Put your hands behind your head!

424
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:27,760
Right!

425
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:29,720
What was the plan, Martin?

426
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:35,640
He'd do one, then you have to follow,
is that it?

427
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:46,280
Why don't you tell us about Jana,
Martin?

428
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:48,280
Hm?

429
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:55,040
I killed her. It was me.

430
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:58,880
Did he tell you to kill the others?

431
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:15,400
We can always ask him.

432
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:18,320
We got him next door.

433
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:22,520
What?

434
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:25,160
Yeah, he's here, Martin.

435
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:31,240
He's just over the corridor.
He's been asking for you as well.

436
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:34,760
Do you want to see him?
Come on, Martin.

437
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:38,360
What the fuck is he up to now?!
"Let's go and see him."

438
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:41,080
Don't worry.
He can't hurt you here, mate.

439
00:42:41,080 --> 00:42:42,160
Eh?

440
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:44,800
Open up. Don't. Don't!

441
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:49,720
Martin, tell 'em!

442
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:53,240
Tell 'em I've got nothing
to do with this! Fuckin' tell 'em!

443
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:57,160
It's not him. I ain't supposed
to be here! This ain't right!

444
00:42:57,160 --> 00:42:59,600
It's not him, it's not him.

445
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:02,160
Martin! Tell 'em!

446
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:04,880
He's out there! Fuckin' tell 'em!

447
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:10,200
You're never gonna get him!
Tell 'em I didn't do anything!

448
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:12,120
Martin! Tell 'em!

449
00:43:13,240 --> 00:43:16,400
You didn't give yourself up to
confess. You wanted protection.

450
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:19,120
I can't protect you unless I know

451
00:43:19,120 --> 00:43:20,920
who I am protecting you from.

452
00:43:20,920 --> 00:43:24,280
We release him and we stay on him.
We let him go to work, go home.

453
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:27,160
That's how we get his mate -
when he thinks it's safe

454
00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:29,640
and the pattern stays the same.

455
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:33,400
Karen McMann was missing in 1997.
What's that got to do with this?

456
00:43:36,520 --> 00:43:38,480
I never told anyone your secrets.

457
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:46,360
Subtitle Synced and Merged by K.G.G.N

458
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:50,136
:)

459
00:44:25,276 --> 00:44:28,836
Ruth Murray died from slow sustained
squeezing on the artery.

460
00:44:28,871 --> 00:44:31,281
Minimal internal damage.
Simple strangle.

461
00:44:31,316 --> 00:44:34,836
Karal Turay, back of her skull
shattered as he beat her head

462
00:44:34,871 --> 00:44:36,841
repeatedly against the floor.

463
00:44:36,876 --> 00:44:40,316
So I guess it's a coincidence.
Methods are different.

464
00:44:40,351 --> 00:44:42,756
It's not a coincidence
if there's a pattern.

465
00:44:48,796 --> 00:44:52,076
Tom's got a theory. I heard it.
You said. Double trouble.

466
00:44:52,111 --> 00:44:54,761
Venables and Thompson,
Brady and Hindley...

467
00:44:54,796 --> 00:44:57,281
Ant and Dec, Robson and Jerome,
Donny and Marie,

468
00:44:57,316 --> 00:45:00,556
Mike and Bernie fuckin' Winters!
You got any evidence, Tom?

469
00:45:00,591 --> 00:45:02,676
No, you don't need it.
You're Tom Thorne.

470
00:45:04,356 --> 00:45:07,136
What are you doing here?
I'm not paying overtime.

471
00:45:07,171 --> 00:45:09,881
I'm going out to forget
about Charlie and his mum

472
00:45:09,916 --> 00:45:13,036
so I can come back tomorrow
and think about them again.

473
00:45:13,071 --> 00:45:15,921
Listen, thanks for coming, Phil.
I appreciate it.

474
00:45:15,956 --> 00:45:19,756
We were friends. You fucked it up.
Sorry for your loss.

475
00:45:24,876 --> 00:45:29,196
Did the boy see it? Why is he alive?
Did the killer get interrupted?

476
00:45:29,231 --> 00:45:32,001
He'd have torn through the floor
if he'd had to.

477
00:45:32,036 --> 00:45:36,316
It's driving me mad. I've looked at
every unsolved murder in ten years.

478
00:45:36,351 --> 00:45:39,161
Luton, Chelmsford, Bromley,
the suburbs.

479
00:45:39,196 --> 00:45:42,436
Every pair of unsolved murders
on the same day. Nothing!

480
00:45:42,471 --> 00:45:44,716
Only unsolved murders, you said?

481
00:45:44,751 --> 00:45:46,161
Yeah, why?

482
00:45:46,196 --> 00:45:48,916
The police are capable
of charging the wrong man.

483
00:45:55,636 --> 00:45:59,916
Jana's death was a horrible thing
for us all here.

484
00:45:59,951 --> 00:46:02,836
We're just trying
to put it behind us.

485
00:46:02,871 --> 00:46:04,756
Martin, we may have a problem.

486
00:46:06,636 --> 00:46:10,836
Two killers, two victims. Same
method, same day. That's the pattern.

487
00:46:10,871 --> 00:46:13,236
Serial killers don't work together.
These do.

488
00:46:20,276 --> 00:46:22,036
Fuck!

489
00:46:25,236 --> 00:46:28,081
What are you doing?!
Sean Bracher, I'm arresting you

490
00:46:28,116 --> 00:46:31,956
on suspicion of the murder of
Karal Turay and Fiona Hutchinson!

491
00:46:31,991 --> 00:46:35,236
I'm the one you're looking for.
I did it.

492
00:46:36,996 --> 00:46:38,321
I killed her. It was me.

493
00:46:38,356 --> 00:46:40,516
Did he tell you to kill the others
too?

494
00:46:40,551 --> 00:46:42,533
Martin, tell him!

495
00:46:42,568 --> 00:46:44,481
Fuckin' tell him!

496
00:46:44,516 --> 00:46:46,596
It's not him, it's not him.

497
00:46:46,631 --> 00:46:48,556
He's out there.

498
00:46:51,036 --> 00:46:52,996
And you're never gonna get him!

499
00:46:58,916 --> 00:47:00,876
You got something to tell me, son?

500
00:47:07,116 --> 00:47:09,076
His name's Charlie.

501
00:47:09,556 --> 00:47:11,516
He's a witness.

502
00:47:13,156 --> 00:47:15,756
He's just staying here
for a few days, alright?

503
00:47:16,436 --> 00:47:19,636
Just till we find him
somewhere safer.

504
00:47:19,671 --> 00:47:21,841
His mum was murdered.

505
00:47:21,876 --> 00:47:23,796
Someone tried to get him last night.

506
00:47:24,956 --> 00:47:28,556
Oh... Oh, Jesus.

507
00:47:46,516 --> 00:47:49,116
Your mate's still out there,
isn't he? Martin!

508
00:47:50,556 --> 00:47:53,836
I'm your friend, Martin.
I'm gonna take care of you.

509
00:47:53,871 --> 00:47:55,716
That's what friends do.

510
00:47:58,596 --> 00:48:00,756
So what will you do for me?

511
00:48:00,791 --> 00:48:03,613
Martin!

512
00:48:03,648 --> 00:48:06,436
Hey!

513
00:48:09,436 --> 00:48:11,396
DI Thorne has entered the room.

514
00:48:13,036 --> 00:48:15,296
I killed Jana,
I killed the prostitute.

515
00:48:15,331 --> 00:48:17,556
You tried to kill the boy,
yes, we know -

516
00:48:17,591 --> 00:48:20,076
Last night you tried to kill Charlie.

517
00:48:20,111 --> 00:48:22,281
So who's your mate going for?

518
00:48:22,316 --> 00:48:26,076
Hm? Was it another witness?
Is that the way it works?

519
00:48:27,156 --> 00:48:29,716
Charlie saw him, so who saw you?
Give us a name.

520
00:48:31,316 --> 00:48:34,956
Oi, look at me!
Do you want to get us some coffees?

521
00:48:51,676 --> 00:48:55,116
Why did you come to us, Martin?
Why give yourself up like that?

522
00:48:56,756 --> 00:48:58,921
I told you.

523
00:48:58,956 --> 00:49:02,776
I killed those two girls.
And I tried to kill that boy.

524
00:49:02,811 --> 00:49:06,596
But it's not two girls, is it?
It's four. Four dead women.

525
00:49:06,631 --> 00:49:10,916
OK, two, four.
Lock me away for four.

526
00:49:13,676 --> 00:49:15,761
You'd do that?

527
00:49:15,796 --> 00:49:18,876
Admit to murders you didn't commit?
What's he got on you?

528
00:49:18,911 --> 00:49:21,036
Please just lock me away.

529
00:49:23,196 --> 00:49:25,396
Why? You think you'd be safe inside?

530
00:49:27,556 --> 00:49:29,921
Safe in your cell.

531
00:49:29,956 --> 00:49:32,516
Maybe, until we catch him.

532
00:49:33,836 --> 00:49:35,876
What if he's in the same nick as you,
eh?

533
00:49:37,236 --> 00:49:39,761
On the same wing.

534
00:49:39,796 --> 00:49:43,556
He stabbed Fiona Hutchinson 23 times.
He smashed Karal Turay's head in.

535
00:49:43,591 --> 00:49:45,361
What's he going to do to you?

536
00:49:45,396 --> 00:49:48,436
Do you think anyone's gonna come
running when they hear you?

537
00:49:48,471 --> 00:49:50,601
I told you what I did.
You can't let him...

538
00:49:50,636 --> 00:49:55,236
You help me get him and I promise
you, you will never see him again.

539
00:49:57,676 --> 00:50:01,416
You didn't give yourself up to us
to confess. You wanted protection.

540
00:50:01,451 --> 00:50:05,156
And I can't protect you unless I know
who I am protecting you from.

541
00:50:09,916 --> 00:50:11,876
So will you give me his name, Martin?

542
00:50:19,276 --> 00:50:21,236
What's his name?

543
00:50:26,436 --> 00:50:29,276
I killed Jana Lovik,
I killed that prostitute

544
00:50:29,311 --> 00:50:31,916
and I tried to kill the boy.

545
00:50:31,951 --> 00:50:33,041
OK.

546
00:50:33,076 --> 00:50:36,161
It's good news. We had a e-fit
in the paper yesterday

547
00:50:36,196 --> 00:50:39,876
and a front-page photo of the
charged killer today. Double killer.

548
00:50:39,911 --> 00:50:43,276
You know we didn't actually catch
this guy, don't you?

549
00:50:43,311 --> 00:50:46,481
He gave himself up.
Don't split hairs, Tom.

550
00:50:46,516 --> 00:50:50,156
He's only in here because being
locked up doesn't scare him.

551
00:50:50,191 --> 00:50:51,481
His mate does.

552
00:50:51,516 --> 00:50:54,281
He fucked up last night,
but his mate didn't.

553
00:50:54,316 --> 00:50:57,236
There's another body out there.
You don't know that.

554
00:50:58,556 --> 00:51:01,076
Say we tell the press
that he didn't fuck up,

555
00:51:01,111 --> 00:51:03,636
that he killed Charlie Turay
last night.

556
00:51:05,236 --> 00:51:09,276
You're Palmer's mate, you read that
your mate was arrested, what d'you do?

557
00:51:09,311 --> 00:51:11,721
Go to ground. Yeah, and we lose him.

558
00:51:11,756 --> 00:51:15,776
Until he decides it's safe
and he starts it all over again.

559
00:51:15,811 --> 00:51:19,796
But if you read that he did the job,
that he's still out there,

560
00:51:19,831 --> 00:51:22,001
then the pattern continues.

561
00:51:22,036 --> 00:51:26,356
But he'll know we've got Palmer as
soon as he starts looking for him.

562
00:51:26,391 --> 00:51:29,241
Not if we release him.
For fuck's sake, Tom.

563
00:51:29,276 --> 00:51:33,116
We release him and we stay on him. He
goes to work, goes home, as normal.

564
00:51:33,151 --> 00:51:36,956
It's how we get his mate - when it's
safe and the pattern stays the same.

565
00:51:36,991 --> 00:51:40,916
He'll do a runner. Where to?
Not to his mate. He's scared of him.

566
00:51:40,951 --> 00:51:43,876
And if he does do a runner,
he'll run right back here.

567
00:51:43,911 --> 00:51:45,796
Like he did last time.

568
00:51:48,356 --> 00:51:51,321
Ruth, it's your call.

569
00:51:51,356 --> 00:51:53,676
Come on, we've done it before.

570
00:51:53,711 --> 00:51:55,996
What time does Palmer start work?

571
00:52:00,116 --> 00:52:04,636
Come on, Ruth. Make a decision, huh?
Or let the clock do it for you.

572
00:52:06,476 --> 00:52:09,756
Sir. Yeah? We may have another one.

573
00:52:13,316 --> 00:52:15,081
Victor Perks, 58.

574
00:52:15,116 --> 00:52:19,481
Vic, apparently. Lived alone.
Edale Road just up there.

575
00:52:19,516 --> 00:52:22,916
Didn't mix much with the neighbours.
Seems he was a drinker.

576
00:52:22,951 --> 00:52:25,036
Last seen alive 4pm yesterday.

577
00:52:26,436 --> 00:52:29,876
It's an hour before Palmer tried
to kill Charlie. OK, bag it up.

578
00:52:31,636 --> 00:52:32,681
Christ.

579
00:52:32,716 --> 00:52:36,001
Strange. Powder marks in the wounds.

580
00:52:36,036 --> 00:52:38,956
He fell over there.
Shot in the knee, crawled to here.

581
00:52:38,991 --> 00:52:40,961
Then a man entered
a magazine into him.

582
00:52:40,996 --> 00:52:45,036
So that's one victim each. Yeah?
Same day, within an hour.

583
00:52:45,071 --> 00:52:47,121
The pattern - both male, both shot.

584
00:52:47,156 --> 00:52:50,676
One nice, one nasty, one couldn't
do it, and one could, and did.

585
00:52:50,711 --> 00:52:53,281
Yeah, but a five-year-old
and a 58-year-old man?

586
00:52:53,316 --> 00:52:56,601
The rest of the victims were of
similar profiles, similar ages.

587
00:52:56,636 --> 00:53:01,076
What's the connection? Palmer tried to
kill Charlie because he was a witness.

588
00:53:01,111 --> 00:53:03,233
Yeah. So what did he see?

589
00:53:03,268 --> 00:53:05,356
Sir, Vic Perks was a copper.

590
00:53:07,516 --> 00:53:09,801
"Victor Perks
was a former detective CID."

591
00:53:09,836 --> 00:53:13,801
"32 years' service
in East London and Borough."

592
00:53:13,836 --> 00:53:19,476
Put "In 1992 he received the Queen's
Medal for distinguished service."

593
00:53:19,511 --> 00:53:21,161
Got to get Ruth with us on this.

594
00:53:21,196 --> 00:53:23,641
Cause of death was...
Multiple gunshot wounds.

595
00:53:23,676 --> 00:53:26,801
Penetrating the heart, lungs,
spleen, tracheal artery.

596
00:53:26,836 --> 00:53:31,516
Preliminary examination of the scene
suggests 17 entry wounds.

597
00:53:31,551 --> 00:53:33,436
OK. Print it, take it.

598
00:53:35,756 --> 00:53:39,276
Wait, Sarah, not you. Dave,
you take it. She's known you longer.

599
00:53:41,116 --> 00:53:43,076
Hey, hey, nice and calm, yeah?

600
00:53:54,596 --> 00:53:57,596
Sure you really want this? Yeah?

601
00:53:57,631 --> 00:53:59,556
Palmer released?

602
00:54:00,876 --> 00:54:06,161
I'm gonna get this fucker.
He killed one of us.

603
00:54:06,196 --> 00:54:10,281
Come on, that's bollocks.
He's just another dead body to you.

604
00:54:10,316 --> 00:54:13,996
Don't give me that police solidarity
thing. You didn't know Vic Perks.

605
00:54:14,031 --> 00:54:15,916
Wanna know the reason?

606
00:54:17,236 --> 00:54:20,596
I know you when you get like this.
You better be sure you're right.

607
00:54:20,631 --> 00:54:22,756
If you're lucky, they'll say no.

608
00:54:28,676 --> 00:54:30,636
Charge Palmer.

609
00:54:32,956 --> 00:54:34,956
Charge Palmer, then bail him.
He's out.

610
00:54:37,356 --> 00:54:39,316
You got what you wanted.

611
00:54:44,096 --> 00:54:47,936
You said Palmer would be at work
by 9:30.

612
00:54:47,971 --> 00:54:49,856
Well?

613
00:55:07,456 --> 00:55:09,416
Are you sure you can trust Palmer?

614
00:55:10,456 --> 00:55:12,021
No, I'm not.

615
00:55:12,056 --> 00:55:14,016
But he's not going anywhere.

616
00:55:14,656 --> 00:55:18,736
For all he knows, his mate is watching
him right now, just like we are.

617
00:55:18,771 --> 00:55:20,696
So this is the safest place
he can be.

618
00:55:35,736 --> 00:55:37,936
You know how much this all costs?

619
00:55:40,096 --> 00:55:43,536
I could do all this with a pair
of binoculars and a thermal vest.

620
00:55:45,936 --> 00:55:47,896
Your shoes, sir. Marvellous.

621
00:55:51,656 --> 00:55:53,616
They look good.

622
00:55:58,496 --> 00:56:00,456
This had better fuckin' work.

623
00:56:14,256 --> 00:56:16,216
Palmer's here.

624
00:56:25,536 --> 00:56:27,936
At least he won't have
to pay his phone bill.

625
00:56:34,576 --> 00:56:39,136
So he calls Manchester.
That'll be his sister, right? Hm.

626
00:56:45,656 --> 00:56:48,301
Oh, God, we've got ourselves
a hoarder.

627
00:56:48,336 --> 00:56:50,781
Christ. Some bastard's
gonna have to log this.

628
00:56:50,816 --> 00:56:54,836
He calls the same number
six times in the last week.

629
00:56:54,871 --> 00:56:58,856
Five seconds, one second.
Two seconds, three seconds.

630
00:57:06,616 --> 00:57:08,781
Sarah? Hm.

631
00:57:08,816 --> 00:57:11,656
Vic Perks was calling Martin Palmer.

632
00:57:15,456 --> 00:57:18,376
Palmer didn't just know about Vic,
he set him up.

633
00:57:18,411 --> 00:57:20,813
Palmer told Psycho
where to find him.

634
00:57:20,848 --> 00:57:23,181
Where is he now? Still at the hotel.

635
00:57:23,216 --> 00:57:25,936
Why was he calling Palmer?
We pulled the voicemail.

636
00:57:25,971 --> 00:57:28,293
If Vic left messages,
Palmer deleted them.

637
00:57:28,328 --> 00:57:30,616
Why don't we ask Palmer?
I'm asking you.

638
00:57:30,651 --> 00:57:32,913
We have a timeline. '96 to '98.

639
00:57:32,948 --> 00:57:35,141
Perks was working CID Lewisham

640
00:57:35,176 --> 00:57:38,696
while Martin Palmer was doing GCSEs
nearby at Lovelock Road School.

641
00:57:38,731 --> 00:57:40,581
That's good work. Well done.

642
00:57:40,616 --> 00:57:43,496
Palmer was, like, 14.
Do we think Psycho killed Perks

643
00:57:43,531 --> 00:57:46,061
because of something that happened
at school?

644
00:57:46,096 --> 00:57:50,256
He could have picked him up.
He didn't have a record. He's 14.

645
00:57:50,291 --> 00:57:53,753
Anything would have been wiped off
the database by now.

646
00:57:53,788 --> 00:57:57,302
Why don't we go and ask the fucker?
We'll ask him, Dave.

647
00:57:57,337 --> 00:58:00,816
But right now we leave him
where he is. Do you understand?

648
00:58:00,851 --> 00:58:02,781
I've got 60 coppers on this.

649
00:58:02,816 --> 00:58:06,016
I don't want you or anybody else
screwing it up.

650
00:58:06,051 --> 00:58:08,741
We need both these guys,
not just Palmer.

651
00:58:08,776 --> 00:58:13,056
Yeah, well, just... Call me if
there's any movement, understand?

652
00:58:13,091 --> 00:58:15,016
Yeah, I'm at the school now.

653
00:58:15,051 --> 00:58:16,136
Alright.

654
00:58:21,456 --> 00:58:24,461
Martin Palmer. Left us in '98.

655
00:58:24,496 --> 00:58:26,656
Am I allowed to ask
what this is about.

656
00:58:26,691 --> 00:58:28,633
No, sorry.

657
00:58:28,668 --> 00:58:30,576
Thanks.

658
00:58:36,616 --> 00:58:40,381
What does TS mean? Oh, TS.

659
00:58:40,416 --> 00:58:42,816
This letter says "TS".
What does that mean?

660
00:58:45,056 --> 00:58:50,336
It seems our young Master Palmer
got himself temporarily suspended.

661
00:58:52,576 --> 00:58:56,536
Here it is. Just a week. No reason
given. Can't have been that awful.

662
00:58:58,936 --> 00:59:01,896
What sort of things would get you
suspended for a week?

663
00:59:01,931 --> 00:59:04,696
Fighting, maybe truancy.

664
00:59:04,731 --> 00:59:06,656
Smoking, of course.

665
00:59:07,696 --> 00:59:11,416
What about this boy? He was suspended
on the same day for two weeks.

666
00:59:11,451 --> 00:59:14,936
Do you know him?
Leonard Bardsley. Len.

667
00:59:35,816 --> 00:59:38,781
Are you Bardsley? Yeah.

668
00:59:38,816 --> 00:59:41,836
DI Thorne.
Miss Evans said I'd find you here.

669
00:59:41,871 --> 00:59:44,856
I'm looking into a former pupil
from here.

670
00:59:44,891 --> 00:59:46,741
Martin Palmer. '93 to '98.

671
00:59:46,776 --> 00:59:50,301
You were in his year, yeah?
Year above.

672
00:59:50,336 --> 00:59:54,416
What, did he top himself,
like his mum? Would you care?

673
00:59:54,451 --> 00:59:56,176
Not really.

674
00:59:57,536 --> 01:00:01,136
There was an incident in '94. You
were both suspended. Why was that?

675
01:00:01,171 --> 01:00:03,701
We had a scrap, that's all.

676
01:00:03,736 --> 01:00:07,656
It must have been a helluva fight,
both suspended. And one expelled.

677
01:00:19,176 --> 01:00:20,696
Who was expelled?

678
01:00:32,776 --> 01:00:35,936
There he is. Stuart fuckin' Nicklin.

679
01:00:39,296 --> 01:00:40,856
Did Nicklin do that to you?

680
01:00:43,536 --> 01:00:45,916
I knocked Palmer's teeth out.

681
01:00:45,951 --> 01:00:48,296
Nicklin bit my fuckin' nose off.

682
01:00:59,056 --> 01:01:01,816
Why'd he hit you? He always hits me.

683
01:01:01,851 --> 01:01:03,553
Not after today he won't.

684
01:01:03,588 --> 01:01:05,256
What will you do for me?

685
01:01:06,976 --> 01:01:08,936
'What will you do for me?'

686
01:01:14,096 --> 01:01:18,176
Stuart Nicklin. Look away, Martin.
You never know who's watching.

687
01:01:18,211 --> 01:01:19,736
Have you got him?

688
01:01:22,816 --> 01:01:26,016
You can't find him, can you?
So where is he? How do I get him?

689
01:01:27,296 --> 01:01:29,621
I don't know.

690
01:01:29,656 --> 01:01:31,741
He can't be found.

691
01:01:31,776 --> 01:01:33,736
Other people have looked for him.

692
01:01:34,856 --> 01:01:38,336
Other policeman. Vic Perks, he was
looking for Nicklin, was he?

693
01:01:38,371 --> 01:01:44,356
He called me, said he wanted
to talk about Stuart.

694
01:01:44,691 --> 01:01:46,953
He was waiting outside my house.

695
01:01:46,988 --> 01:01:49,216
He asked me if I'd seen him.

696
01:01:49,251 --> 01:01:50,701
What did you say?

697
01:01:50,736 --> 01:01:53,856
Stuart was inside watching me.

698
01:01:53,891 --> 01:01:56,301
Don't look at me.

699
01:01:56,336 --> 01:02:00,176
Then what? I told him I'd meet him.
Somewhere we could talk.

700
01:02:00,211 --> 01:02:02,696
He said Greenwich.
But you didn't go, did you?

701
01:02:04,576 --> 01:02:06,456
You told Stuart about him.

702
01:02:06,491 --> 01:02:09,101
He saw me with him.

703
01:02:09,136 --> 01:02:12,896
Why was Vic Perks looking for
Nicklin? He hasn't got a record.

704
01:02:15,456 --> 01:02:19,136
You don't understand. I hadn't seen
Stuart since we were kids.

705
01:02:19,171 --> 01:02:21,656
So why did he come back?

706
01:02:34,456 --> 01:02:37,781
It's Polish book.
It's really creepy.

707
01:02:37,816 --> 01:02:43,796
It's Polish porn! It's not porn,
it's poetry, Polish poetry.

708
01:02:58,016 --> 01:03:03,216
Hey, Martin, where you going? Jana
loves her Polish book, don't you?

709
01:03:03,251 --> 01:03:06,816
Such a weirdo. Look at how he walks.
Fuckin' weird.

710
01:03:11,816 --> 01:03:13,776
Hello, Mart.

711
01:03:17,096 --> 01:03:18,301
Stuart.

712
01:03:18,336 --> 01:03:20,296
It's been a while.

713
01:03:21,216 --> 01:03:23,696
Where had he been?

714
01:03:23,731 --> 01:03:25,901
It's not...

715
01:03:25,936 --> 01:03:29,216
He doesn't talk like that.
He says...

716
01:03:29,251 --> 01:03:31,261
He tells me what I have to do.

717
01:03:31,296 --> 01:03:33,581
What did he want?
You know what he wanted.

718
01:03:33,616 --> 01:03:36,856
You don't do all this just cos
he beat up Bardsley for you.

719
01:03:36,891 --> 01:03:39,421
Has he got something on you?

720
01:03:39,456 --> 01:03:43,896
Do you know what it's like
to be really scared of someone?

721
01:03:45,816 --> 01:03:47,776
Just help me.

722
01:03:48,856 --> 01:03:50,816
I want it to end.

723
01:03:54,336 --> 01:03:56,541
I will help you, Martin.

724
01:03:56,576 --> 01:03:59,576
But you just keep doing
what you're doing, alright?

725
01:03:59,611 --> 01:04:01,496
Or you're on your own.

726
01:04:10,056 --> 01:04:12,016
Who are you? I'm Karen.

727
01:04:13,496 --> 01:04:17,581
So, we've nothing on Stuart Nicklin
between 1997 and now.

728
01:04:17,616 --> 01:04:21,276
Nothing. He just disappeared. No
driving licence, no bank details.

729
01:04:21,311 --> 01:04:25,183
He must have changed his name but
Palmer can't help us with that.

730
01:04:25,218 --> 01:04:29,021
So he's been hiding. Or planning
something. Maybe he's been abroad.

731
01:04:29,056 --> 01:04:34,096
We circulated his name, dental records
from school via Interpol. Nothing back yet.

732
01:04:34,131 --> 01:04:36,901
OK, that's what we don't know.
What DO we know?

733
01:04:36,936 --> 01:04:40,216
He's got a hold over Palmer
and he's extremely violent.

734
01:04:40,251 --> 01:04:43,461
So he may have been doing this
for the past 13 years.

735
01:04:43,496 --> 01:04:48,016
Vic Perks retired 13 years ago,
just after Nicklin disappeared.

736
01:04:48,051 --> 01:04:50,821
Have you been through his files?
It could take a month.

737
01:04:50,856 --> 01:04:55,536
I want every scribbled bit of paper,
every note, every clipping,

738
01:04:55,571 --> 01:04:58,616
you go through his phone records,
you understand me?!

739
01:04:58,651 --> 01:05:01,421
Dave, you go with her. Sir.

740
01:05:01,456 --> 01:05:05,496
Is this it? As good as we'll get. A
digital age-up of the school photo.

741
01:05:05,531 --> 01:05:07,416
Alright. I want this circulated.

742
01:05:09,016 --> 01:05:10,976
Get this out on the streets.

743
01:05:14,216 --> 01:05:16,176
Gonna bring him in.

744
01:05:16,976 --> 01:05:19,976
Come on, Charlie!
That's my boy! Come on!

745
01:05:21,856 --> 01:05:23,816
Hey, hey! What's going on?

746
01:05:24,896 --> 01:05:29,096
He's... He's got the makings
of a grand little player.

747
01:05:29,131 --> 01:05:31,421
As good as you were
when you were his age.

748
01:05:31,456 --> 01:05:34,936
I don't remember you playing with me
at eight at night, or any time.

749
01:05:34,971 --> 01:05:37,541
What's with the specs?
We went to the cinema.

750
01:05:37,576 --> 01:05:41,696
Dad, I asked you not to take him out.
You know what, I'm done.

751
01:05:41,731 --> 01:05:45,816
Time for bed. Choose some books
and you can choose a story, yeah?

752
01:05:53,936 --> 01:05:55,896
Charlie, come here, come here.

753
01:05:56,936 --> 01:05:58,896
I've got something for you.

754
01:06:02,136 --> 01:06:03,901
It's a midnight feast.

755
01:06:03,936 --> 01:06:07,136
Go on, let me show you. Don't say
anything to your Uncle Tom.

756
01:06:08,456 --> 01:06:11,976
Because...
he'll want one for himself.

757
01:06:12,011 --> 01:06:13,896
Now where is it? Yes, here it is.

758
01:06:15,176 --> 01:06:17,896
Now, then. That is for you.

759
01:06:25,056 --> 01:06:26,796
What happened?

760
01:06:26,831 --> 01:06:28,903
Charlie, hey!

761
01:06:28,938 --> 01:06:30,941
It's alright.

762
01:06:30,976 --> 01:06:33,856
What happened?
It were only a chocolate bar.

763
01:06:41,896 --> 01:06:44,061
Really? Thanks.

764
01:06:44,096 --> 01:06:47,176
What? They tested a chocolate bar
from Karal's house.

765
01:06:47,211 --> 01:06:49,096
No prints, no DNA.

766
01:06:50,256 --> 01:06:52,261
How does that make any sense?

767
01:06:52,296 --> 01:06:55,896
He butchers Karal, then he charges
through looking for the boy

768
01:06:55,931 --> 01:06:57,741
just to give him some chocolate.

769
01:06:57,776 --> 01:07:00,376
And if he did find him...
Why didn't he kill him?

770
01:07:01,536 --> 01:07:03,496
I don't know.

771
01:07:04,576 --> 01:07:07,976
He wiped it and gave it to Charlie?
You didn't see him freak out.

772
01:07:10,176 --> 01:07:12,936
No chocolate wrapper
at Fiona Hutchinson's killing.

773
01:07:12,971 --> 01:07:16,016
The wind off the river,
it could be anywhere.

774
01:07:16,051 --> 01:07:18,776
What about Vic Perks? Nothing yet.

775
01:07:22,256 --> 01:07:27,036
What time's your detail at Palmer's
flat? 2am. Graveyard shift.

776
01:07:27,071 --> 01:07:31,781
Why don't you take a break,
get some fresh air? Thank you, sir.

777
01:07:31,816 --> 01:07:35,256
At the tunnel where Vic Perks was
discovered. See what you can find.

778
01:07:36,536 --> 01:07:39,456
Oh... Alright with that?
I can get Dave to go with you.

779
01:07:39,491 --> 01:07:41,856
No. No problem.

780
01:07:45,496 --> 01:07:48,976
# You're looking at a man
that's getting kinda mad

781
01:07:49,011 --> 01:07:53,616
# I had lots of luck
but it's all been bad...

782
01:07:57,216 --> 01:08:01,016
# I'll never get out of this world
alive

783
01:08:02,496 --> 01:08:05,536
What are you calling me out
this time of night for?

784
01:08:06,736 --> 01:08:09,576
How does somebody kill like this
and leave no trace?

785
01:08:09,611 --> 01:08:14,021
No... DNA, no prints, nothing.

786
01:08:14,056 --> 01:08:17,096
You just shave your body,
cover your hair, wear gloves.

787
01:08:18,336 --> 01:08:21,096
Basic food hygiene stuff, you know.

788
01:08:24,536 --> 01:08:28,816
We found all this
at Vic Perks's house.

789
01:08:28,851 --> 01:08:30,381
What is that?

790
01:08:30,416 --> 01:08:34,296
Every case he ever worked?
No, it's just one case.

791
01:08:34,331 --> 01:08:35,781
Jesus.

792
01:08:35,816 --> 01:08:39,581
Karen McMann.

793
01:08:39,616 --> 01:08:41,376
Some girl that went missing.

794
01:08:43,176 --> 01:08:45,256
Who are you? I'm Karen.

795
01:08:59,136 --> 01:09:01,376
Hello. Oh!

796
01:09:02,936 --> 01:09:04,381
Sorry.

797
01:09:04,416 --> 01:09:06,261
Why are you here?

798
01:09:06,296 --> 01:09:10,036
We didn't feel comfortable with you
being here by yourself.

799
01:09:10,071 --> 01:09:13,776
I don't need protection.
Alright. How about some company?

800
01:09:28,496 --> 01:09:30,696
I'm telling you,
this is a waste of time.

801
01:09:37,696 --> 01:09:39,556
Fuckin' Tom Thorne.

802
01:09:39,591 --> 01:09:41,416
I'm not. Are you?

803
01:09:43,176 --> 01:09:45,136
Teacher's pet.

804
01:09:47,336 --> 01:09:50,696
Scared of a little competition,
are you, Sarah?

805
01:09:50,731 --> 01:09:52,616
You're not competition.

806
01:09:55,336 --> 01:09:57,061
Oh, yeah?

807
01:09:57,096 --> 01:10:02,696
That's funny, cos I've just found
his precious chocolate-bar wrapper.

808
01:10:06,096 --> 01:10:10,896
So, Karen McMann, this 14-year-old
girl, goes missing in 1997.

809
01:10:11,896 --> 01:10:13,696
What's that got to do with this?

810
01:10:15,856 --> 01:10:18,261
I dunno.

811
01:10:18,296 --> 01:10:20,261
But it meant something to Vic.

812
01:10:20,296 --> 01:10:23,136
Nicklin killed Vic Perks
for a reason.

813
01:10:24,976 --> 01:10:26,936
Something that Vic knew or saw.

814
01:10:27,936 --> 01:10:31,616
Vic was a sad old copper with an
obsession that killed him in the end.

815
01:10:33,256 --> 01:10:36,416
Sounds like you were writing
my obituary there, Phil.

816
01:10:36,451 --> 01:10:39,501
I need to get this back
to forensics.

817
01:10:39,536 --> 01:10:45,216
Then I've got half an hour to kill
before I'm on at Palmer's.

818
01:10:45,251 --> 01:10:46,896
Wanna get a quick drink?

819
01:10:55,576 --> 01:10:57,536
Oh...

820
01:11:02,976 --> 01:11:04,936
Maybe this isn't a good idea.

821
01:11:07,856 --> 01:11:09,816
What's not?

822
01:11:54,456 --> 01:11:58,336
"Second interview,
Martin Palmer. August 28th, 1997."

823
01:11:58,371 --> 01:12:01,096
"Present: DC Perks and DS Davis."

824
01:12:02,816 --> 01:12:05,876
"Tell us what you saw one more time,
Martin."

825
01:12:05,911 --> 01:12:08,901
"I saw Karen get
into a blue Vauxhall Cavalier."

826
01:12:08,936 --> 01:12:12,656
"Were you alone or was Stuart
Nicklin with you? I was on my own."

827
01:12:12,691 --> 01:12:16,173
"Really, Martin? Why are you
covering for him? I'm not."

828
01:12:16,208 --> 01:12:19,656
"It's a bit of a coincidence,
him not being around."

829
01:12:19,691 --> 01:12:21,821
"We know what he's capable of."

830
01:12:21,856 --> 01:12:24,541
"Tell me what Stuart did to Karen.
I don't know."

831
01:12:24,576 --> 01:12:27,656
"Stop covering for him
and tell me what he did to her."

832
01:12:27,691 --> 01:12:30,341
"I told you. How many more times?"

833
01:12:30,376 --> 01:12:34,296
"Karen got into
a blue Vauxhall Cavalier."

834
01:12:35,616 --> 01:12:38,336
And they never found a body? No.

835
01:12:39,896 --> 01:12:43,221
It's what Perks has been looking for
all these years.

836
01:12:43,256 --> 01:12:49,176
You think Nicklin killed her? It's
not too late to go and ask Palmer.

837
01:12:55,376 --> 01:12:57,336
Shit, it's gone two!

838
01:13:07,936 --> 01:13:09,896
Sarah.

839
01:13:11,936 --> 01:13:13,896
Don't you ever fuckin' knock?

840
01:13:22,136 --> 01:13:24,656
DS Chen approaching Palmer's HA.
Don't shoot.

841
01:13:34,896 --> 01:13:39,416
You're late. Piss off, Dev. I said
I was running ten minutes late.

842
01:13:39,451 --> 01:13:41,336
Hey, Mitch. Is he in there?

843
01:13:45,336 --> 01:13:47,296
Thanks.

844
01:13:51,336 --> 01:13:53,296
Tax-payer pizza, is it?

845
01:13:54,376 --> 01:13:56,336
No, it's my money. I paid for it.

846
01:14:02,016 --> 01:14:03,936
Can't smoke in here.

847
01:14:03,971 --> 01:14:05,896
Smoke alarm.

848
01:14:21,856 --> 01:14:23,856
Why are you looking at me?

849
01:14:26,776 --> 01:14:28,736
Eat your pizza.

850
01:14:31,376 --> 01:14:32,941
So, is this what you do?

851
01:14:32,976 --> 01:14:34,996
Sit around, stare at the wall,

852
01:14:35,031 --> 01:14:37,016
waiting for the phone to ring?

853
01:14:38,456 --> 01:14:40,936
Sounds as if you know
what that's like.

854
01:14:40,971 --> 01:14:43,416
We found your tears
on Ruth Murray's face.

855
01:14:46,016 --> 01:14:47,696
Do you cry on all of them?

856
01:14:49,696 --> 01:14:51,656
I don't like to talk about it.

857
01:14:55,216 --> 01:14:57,501
Why not?

858
01:14:57,536 --> 01:14:59,496
You must like doing it.

859
01:15:03,456 --> 01:15:05,101
Too personal?

860
01:15:05,136 --> 01:15:07,096
Why are you doing this?

861
01:15:09,536 --> 01:15:11,496
I have no idea.

862
01:15:15,176 --> 01:15:18,096
I'd like to go to bed... now,
please.

863
01:15:19,696 --> 01:15:21,656
Right.

864
01:15:24,976 --> 01:15:27,856
Go and get me a coffee, would you,
Mitch? A decent one.

865
01:15:27,891 --> 01:15:30,656
Get yourself one too. Oh, thanks.

866
01:15:30,691 --> 01:15:32,616
He's asleep. I'll be fine.

867
01:16:25,456 --> 01:16:29,816
She's nothing special.
WE'RE the special ones, you and me!

868
01:16:30,656 --> 01:16:32,616
Why don't we just get rid of her?

869
01:16:47,256 --> 01:16:49,216
You let me down, Mart.

870
01:16:50,456 --> 01:16:53,181
I tried.

871
01:16:53,216 --> 01:16:55,176
You didn't tell me he was so little.

872
01:16:57,576 --> 01:16:59,616
My hand was sweating.
They caught me.

873
01:17:04,496 --> 01:17:06,456
No, they didn't.

874
01:17:07,376 --> 01:17:09,336
I saw you.

875
01:17:11,696 --> 01:17:14,496
I always knew you were chickenshit,
Martin, but...

876
01:17:15,816 --> 01:17:17,776
...I didn't think you'd sell me out.

877
01:17:19,576 --> 01:17:21,981
No.

878
01:17:22,016 --> 01:17:23,976
I thought blood was thicker.

879
01:17:28,336 --> 01:17:30,581
I didn't...

880
01:17:30,616 --> 01:17:33,216
I didn't tell 'em anything.
This is their idea.

881
01:17:35,456 --> 01:17:37,616
You told them about Vic Perks.

882
01:17:38,616 --> 01:17:40,616
That copper.

883
01:17:43,616 --> 01:17:45,576
You told them my name.

884
01:17:47,056 --> 01:17:49,016
Now they're all over me.

885
01:17:51,136 --> 01:17:53,816
I never told anyone your secrets,
Mart.

886
01:17:53,851 --> 01:17:55,736
I never told a soul.

887
01:17:58,896 --> 01:18:00,856
But you...

888
01:18:02,216 --> 01:18:03,816
You told 'em all about me.

889
01:18:03,851 --> 01:18:05,776
Please.

890
01:18:07,736 --> 01:18:09,456
Please.

891
01:18:12,216 --> 01:18:14,181
Please what?

892
01:18:14,216 --> 01:18:16,176
Please don't kill you?

893
01:18:19,216 --> 01:18:21,176
Is that what you think? Please, Stu.

894
01:18:23,176 --> 01:18:25,136
Christ, Mart.

895
01:18:26,656 --> 01:18:29,661
You really think
I'd kill you?

896
01:18:29,696 --> 01:18:31,736
After everything we've been through?

897
01:18:33,856 --> 01:18:35,816
I'm so sorry.

898
01:18:47,136 --> 01:18:50,536
You know.
You know what you've gotta do.

899
01:18:50,571 --> 01:18:52,456
Please...

900
01:18:53,736 --> 01:18:55,696
This isn't for you.

901
01:18:57,736 --> 01:18:59,376
It's for her.

902
01:19:02,216 --> 01:19:06,936
Let's fuck her up.

903
01:19:14,896 --> 01:19:16,461
Control, this is Sarah Chen.

904
01:19:16,496 --> 01:19:20,736
Tango 1 is in the flat,
believed armed. Repeat, in the flat.

905
01:19:31,896 --> 01:19:33,816
Shit.

906
01:19:56,176 --> 01:19:58,136
It's OK.

907
01:20:36,136 --> 01:20:40,736
Sarah! Sarah, Sarah, Sarah, Sarah...

908
01:20:51,456 --> 01:20:53,416
He's gone, he's gone.

909
01:20:55,496 --> 01:20:58,581
Sarah, Sarah! What happened?

910
01:20:58,616 --> 01:21:02,736
I- I-I... I went the bathroom
and he was pretending to be asleep.

911
01:21:03,896 --> 01:21:06,436
He was... He...
He was at the door.

912
01:21:06,471 --> 01:21:08,941
That's not true. She left it open!

913
01:21:08,976 --> 01:21:11,901
Were you here on your own?
Where the hell were you?!

914
01:21:11,936 --> 01:21:16,176
Come here, sit down. Did you see him?
Sarah, did you get a look at him?

915
01:21:16,211 --> 01:21:19,856
He tried to kill me! Alright.
That one!

916
01:21:19,891 --> 01:21:22,333
No. I didn't, I didn't. Please!

917
01:21:22,368 --> 01:21:24,512
I heard them! I heard them!

918
01:21:24,547 --> 01:21:26,621
I want this place locked down!

919
01:21:26,656 --> 01:21:28,856
You bring him out.
He's coming with me!

920
01:21:28,891 --> 01:21:30,616
Sarah, you're coming with us.

921
01:21:30,651 --> 01:21:32,576
Get him out of here!

922
01:21:40,016 --> 01:21:42,136
Tell me about Karen, Martin.

923
01:21:44,376 --> 01:21:46,296
Karen McMann. You tell me about her.

924
01:21:51,536 --> 01:21:53,661
I want answers, man!
You understand me?!

925
01:21:53,696 --> 01:21:56,616
Karen's dead. She got into a car
and nobody saw her again.

926
01:22:00,656 --> 01:22:02,741
Stop this, please. Answer him.

927
01:22:02,776 --> 01:22:05,696
Karen got into
a blue Vauxhall Cavalier.

928
01:22:05,731 --> 01:22:07,781
Don't fuck with me, Martin.

929
01:22:07,816 --> 01:22:11,656
Stuart Nicklin killed her, didn't he?
Was she his first? No.

930
01:22:11,691 --> 01:22:13,616
We met at the pond, the three of us.

931
01:22:13,651 --> 01:22:15,661
What pond? Where?!

932
01:22:15,696 --> 01:22:18,781
Was she Stuart's girlfriend? No.

933
01:22:18,816 --> 01:22:21,536
Yours? He killed her
cos he doesn't like sharing?

934
01:22:21,571 --> 01:22:24,301
Karen got into
a blue Vauxhall Cavalier.

935
01:22:24,336 --> 01:22:28,216
He killed her, didn't he? He killed
her and you covered up for him.

936
01:22:28,251 --> 01:22:32,061
No, that's not true. She got into
a car, a blue Vauxhall Cavalier.

937
01:22:32,096 --> 01:22:36,656
You want him out there. You think it'll get
you off the hook. No, I'm not... That's not...

938
01:22:36,691 --> 01:22:38,813
How did Nicklin get into the flat?

939
01:22:38,848 --> 01:22:40,936
She let him in. Don't fuckin' lie!

940
01:22:42,976 --> 01:22:45,221
You knew he was coming, didn't you?
Eh?

941
01:22:45,256 --> 01:22:47,741
You knew he was coming,
you left the door open.

942
01:22:47,776 --> 01:22:51,896
You planned it. Tell me! Tell me!
Why are you letting him do this?

943
01:22:51,931 --> 01:22:54,736
Don't fucking look at me!
Don't fucking...

944
01:22:55,656 --> 01:22:57,536
Sarah! Calm down!

945
01:22:57,571 --> 01:22:59,416
Sarah! Sarah!

946
01:23:35,736 --> 01:23:37,256
I'm...

947
01:24:07,216 --> 01:24:11,056
No sightings of either subject
but it's only been three hours.

948
01:24:11,091 --> 01:24:12,621
Central 5,000 have been cleared.

949
01:24:12,656 --> 01:24:15,416
They've provided us
with full incident support.

950
01:24:15,451 --> 01:24:18,176
Every dead body that comes in,
it's my fault.

951
01:24:18,211 --> 01:24:20,093
You took a gamble,
it didn't come off.

952
01:24:20,128 --> 01:24:21,941
He was the bait. Now we got nothing.

953
01:24:21,976 --> 01:24:24,496
When Tom Thorne shows up,
tell him to call me.

954
01:24:24,531 --> 01:24:26,416
How do I get Nicklin without Palmer?

955
01:24:27,616 --> 01:24:30,356
I don't want her on the job -
Sarah Chen.

956
01:24:30,391 --> 01:24:33,203
She's alright.
Trust me, she's not up to it.

957
01:24:33,238 --> 01:24:36,016
He said you killed Karen.
What do you think?

958
01:24:36,051 --> 01:24:37,821
You know the truth.

959
01:24:37,856 --> 01:24:41,496
We need to talk. Is this about
you and me? Grow up, Dave.

960
01:24:41,531 --> 01:24:45,136
All I've ever asked is that
you play straight with me, Tom.

961
01:24:45,171 --> 01:24:47,941
It's none of your business. Really?

962
01:24:47,976 --> 01:24:50,901
Sarah knows where they are.
What the fuck is she doing?

963
01:24:50,936 --> 01:24:55,176
You should just go home - you're no
use to me. You don't belong here.

964
01:24:55,211 --> 01:24:57,501
You ready to find out what it's like?

965
01:24:57,536 --> 01:25:01,736
They can only kill together. You've
got to find out what that kid saw.

966
01:25:01,771 --> 01:25:04,673
When you were hiding
did you hear two men talking?

967
01:25:04,708 --> 01:25:07,576
You sure? There could have been
two different - Tom...

968
01:25:07,611 --> 01:25:10,981
I think he's given you
the best answer he can.

969
01:25:11,016 --> 01:25:15,216
No lies any more. You killed her.
Karen got into a blue -

970
01:25:15,251 --> 01:25:17,941
Stop this! D'you want to see her?

971
01:25:17,976 --> 01:25:20,936
Find where a lad could dig a grave
and not be seen.

972
01:25:20,971 --> 01:25:23,656
It's not where you walk your dog,
like a park.

973
01:25:23,691 --> 01:25:25,381
It's undeveloped land.

974
01:25:25,416 --> 01:25:28,936
I didn't walk.
He doesn't want me there.

975
01:25:28,971 --> 01:25:30,376
No, I'll be alright.

976
01:25:30,411 --> 01:25:33,016
Phil! Phil!

977
01:26:18,716 --> 01:26:22,826
Two pairs of victims, same methods,
same day. That's the pattern.

978
01:26:22,836 --> 01:26:25,986
Tom's got a theory.
I heard it. Double trouble.

979
01:26:25,996 --> 01:26:28,386
Do you have any evidence, Tom?

980
01:26:28,396 --> 01:26:30,826
Not he, they. Two killers.

981
01:26:30,836 --> 01:26:33,506
Serial killer don't work together.
These ones do.

982
01:26:33,516 --> 01:26:36,146
Martin, we may have a problem.

983
01:26:36,156 --> 01:26:39,026
Do you think the boy saw anything?
Why is he still alive?

984
01:26:43,396 --> 01:26:46,866
I killed her. It was me. And did he
tell you to kill the others too?

985
01:26:46,876 --> 01:26:50,906
Martin! Tell them!
Fuckin' tell 'em!

986
01:26:50,916 --> 01:26:52,986
It's not him, it's not him.

987
01:26:52,996 --> 01:26:54,946
He's out there.

988
01:26:57,476 --> 01:26:59,426
And you're never gonna get him.

989
01:27:00,356 --> 01:27:03,186
We release him and stay on him.
He goes to work, goes home.

990
01:27:03,196 --> 01:27:04,866
That's how we get his mate,

991
01:27:04,876 --> 01:27:07,546
when he thinks it's safe
and the pattern stays the same.

992
01:27:07,556 --> 01:27:10,906
I can't hang around here all day
looking after some kid.

993
01:27:10,916 --> 01:27:12,946
His mum was murdered.

994
01:27:12,956 --> 01:27:17,146
Victor Perks, 58. Vic, apparently.
He was a copper.

995
01:27:17,156 --> 01:27:20,066
He can't be found.
Other people have looked for him.

996
01:27:20,076 --> 01:27:22,066
Vic Perks?
He was looking for Nicklin?

997
01:27:22,076 --> 01:27:25,586
We've nothing on Stuart Nicklin
between 1997 and now.

998
01:27:25,596 --> 01:27:28,226
Nothing. No driving licence,
no bank details.

999
01:27:28,236 --> 01:27:30,866
He must have changed his name
but Palmer can't help us.

1000
01:27:34,676 --> 01:27:37,106
I always knew
you were chickenshit, Martin,

1001
01:27:37,116 --> 01:27:39,266
but you told them. About the cop.

1002
01:27:39,276 --> 01:27:43,386
Karen McMann, this 14-year-old girl,
goes missing in 1997.

1003
01:27:43,396 --> 01:27:45,346
What's that got to do with this?

1004
01:27:45,356 --> 01:27:48,466
It meant something to Vic.
He was killed for a reason.

1005
01:27:48,476 --> 01:27:50,106
I want answers!

1006
01:27:50,116 --> 01:27:52,426
Karen got into
a blue Vauxhall Cavalier.

1007
01:27:52,436 --> 01:27:56,026
Stuart Nicklin killed her, didn't he?
Was she his first? No.

1008
01:27:56,036 --> 01:27:57,946
Don't fuckin' lie!

1009
01:28:21,956 --> 01:28:24,426
Did they get him? No.

1010
01:28:24,436 --> 01:28:29,226
Was this an accident? Did Palmer do
this? He freaked out and I skidded.

1011
01:28:29,236 --> 01:28:33,146
I have to report to Gold Group
in two hours.

1012
01:28:33,156 --> 01:28:35,426
It seems I'm getting a minder.

1013
01:28:35,436 --> 01:28:39,626
Tughan? They need a safe pair of
hands, which right now rules me out.

1014
01:28:39,636 --> 01:28:44,626
It was a good plan. It drew Nicklin
out. You fuckin' well lost him! How?!

1015
01:28:44,636 --> 01:28:49,226
I released Palmer! Palmer isn't
the problem. He fuckin' well is now!

1016
01:28:49,236 --> 01:28:52,186
Do you know what I think?
I think in some fucked-up way,

1017
01:28:52,196 --> 01:28:55,626
which I cannot begin to comprehend,
this is what you want.

1018
01:28:57,636 --> 01:28:59,586
You wanted him out there.

1019
01:29:01,156 --> 01:29:03,106
Well, now you've got it.

1020
01:29:11,516 --> 01:29:14,266
Is there any news on Chen?

1021
01:29:14,276 --> 01:29:16,706
Yeah, she's been admitted
for observation.

1022
01:29:21,116 --> 01:29:22,946
How close are you to her?

1023
01:29:23,876 --> 01:29:25,746
How d'you mean?

1024
01:29:25,756 --> 01:29:30,826
Well, have you noticed anything
about her, anything unusual?

1025
01:29:30,836 --> 01:29:33,666
We've all been a bit edgy, boss,
but, er...

1026
01:29:33,676 --> 01:29:38,426
I haven't noticed anything...
particular about DS Chen, no.

1027
01:30:09,796 --> 01:30:11,746
'He's out there!'

1028
01:30:14,036 --> 01:30:15,986
"You're never gonna get him."

1029
01:30:40,556 --> 01:30:42,426
You look like shit, Mart.

1030
01:30:45,676 --> 01:30:47,586
I thought you'd never get here.

1031
01:30:47,596 --> 01:30:50,986
Right, listen up. There's been
no sightings of either subject

1032
01:30:50,996 --> 01:30:52,706
but it's only been three hours.

1033
01:30:52,716 --> 01:30:55,946
Central 5,000 have been cleared.

1034
01:30:55,956 --> 01:30:59,466
They're providing us with full
incident support from Cobalt Square

1035
01:30:59,476 --> 01:31:00,786
under our command.

1036
01:31:00,796 --> 01:31:04,946
TFL have given the Nicklin e-fit
and Palmer's picture

1037
01:31:04,956 --> 01:31:07,266
to every tube worker and bus driver,

1038
01:31:07,276 --> 01:31:10,786
and we are pulling in
all the feeds from the stations.

1039
01:31:10,796 --> 01:31:12,706
Well, get on with it!

1040
01:31:22,116 --> 01:31:24,026
Did you know he was coke head?

1041
01:31:25,316 --> 01:31:26,666
What?

1042
01:31:26,676 --> 01:31:32,546
Technical support turned up coke
all over Palmer's bathroom.

1043
01:31:32,556 --> 01:31:35,906
You didn't tell Ruth that when
you persuaded her to let him out.

1044
01:31:42,876 --> 01:31:44,986
What's up, mate?

1045
01:31:44,996 --> 01:31:48,066
You don't look pleased to see me.
What is it, Martin?

1046
01:31:48,076 --> 01:31:51,066
That copper...

1047
01:31:51,076 --> 01:31:53,026
told me what happened.

1048
01:31:54,476 --> 01:31:55,626
Karen.

1049
01:31:57,396 --> 01:31:59,586
You know what happened to Karen.

1050
01:31:59,596 --> 01:32:02,986
He said... you killed her.

1051
01:32:02,996 --> 01:32:04,786
He said you killed Karen.

1052
01:32:08,436 --> 01:32:10,386
What do you think?

1053
01:32:11,996 --> 01:32:14,466
Huh? You know the truth.

1054
01:32:14,476 --> 01:32:19,186
They're fuckin'... with my head.
Everyone is telling...

1055
01:32:19,196 --> 01:32:21,106
This is what they do, Martin.

1056
01:32:22,956 --> 01:32:25,666
They get inside your head,
chisel their way in,

1057
01:32:25,676 --> 01:32:27,466
and they try to break us.

1058
01:32:27,476 --> 01:32:29,426
And you always let them.

1059
01:32:34,116 --> 01:32:36,386
I'm just saying.

1060
01:32:36,396 --> 01:32:38,346
So what?

1061
01:32:42,476 --> 01:32:47,306
Karen... Karen got into
a blue Vauxhall Cavalier.

1062
01:32:47,316 --> 01:32:50,426
August 27th, 1997.

1063
01:32:52,596 --> 01:32:55,906
Right here. 13 years ago, Martin.

1064
01:32:55,916 --> 01:32:57,746
That's the truth, mate.

1065
01:33:02,676 --> 01:33:04,626
OK.

1066
01:33:55,556 --> 01:33:57,986
Every dead body that comes in,
it's my fault.

1067
01:33:57,996 --> 01:33:59,906
You took a gamble.
It didn't come off.

1068
01:33:59,916 --> 01:34:02,386
If it always came off,
it wouldn't be a gamble.

1069
01:34:02,396 --> 01:34:04,386
He was the bait.
Now we have nothing.

1070
01:34:04,396 --> 01:34:07,466
You know what? Why don't you
just throw yourself in?

1071
01:34:07,476 --> 01:34:10,146
I'm not sticking around
listening to you whine.

1072
01:34:10,156 --> 01:34:12,586
When Tom Thorne show up,
tell him to call me.

1073
01:34:12,596 --> 01:34:14,706
How do I get Nicklin without Palmer?
Eh?

1074
01:34:17,676 --> 01:34:22,386
You know the answer to that, don't
you? Karen McMann gets us Nicklin.

1075
01:34:22,396 --> 01:34:25,946
No one gives a toss about some girl
that went missing 14 years ago.

1076
01:34:25,956 --> 01:34:28,626
Got every copper in London
looking for these two.

1077
01:34:28,636 --> 01:34:30,466
Full technical, Central 5,000.

1078
01:34:30,476 --> 01:34:34,346
It won't work. You won't find him
that way. Karen gets us Nicklin.

1079
01:34:34,356 --> 01:34:37,546
Vic knew that too. He did.
That's what got him killed.

1080
01:34:37,556 --> 01:34:40,066
We get to that, we get to Nicklin,
and Palmer.

1081
01:34:52,196 --> 01:34:54,146
So, what, you living rough?

1082
01:34:55,316 --> 01:34:57,746
Beg?

1083
01:34:57,756 --> 01:35:00,506
Rob? Yeah, and more.

1084
01:35:00,516 --> 01:35:02,466
So, are you ready, Mart?

1085
01:35:04,556 --> 01:35:06,866
Are you ready to find out
what it's like...

1086
01:35:07,756 --> 01:35:09,706
...to be Stu?

1087
01:35:22,276 --> 01:35:24,266
For fuck's sake, Dave.

1088
01:35:24,276 --> 01:35:26,466
So were you gonna ignore me all day,
then?

1089
01:35:28,596 --> 01:35:32,266
Listen, last night - Guess what,
Dave. Last night was pretty busy.

1090
01:35:32,276 --> 01:35:35,426
I gotta tell you, you weren't
the most memorable partner.

1091
01:35:38,396 --> 01:35:39,746
Yeah.

1092
01:35:39,756 --> 01:35:43,026
Well, we need to talk
about all of that anyway.

1093
01:35:43,036 --> 01:35:45,026
Why, what's he said?

1094
01:35:45,036 --> 01:35:47,346
Who? Thorne? Huh.

1095
01:35:47,356 --> 01:35:49,386
Nothing. He said that...

1096
01:35:49,396 --> 01:35:52,186
Palmer freaked out,
he lost control of the car.

1097
01:35:52,196 --> 01:35:54,866
I can't figure out
why you were in the car at all.

1098
01:35:54,876 --> 01:35:58,466
You'd just been attacked by the guy.
That's all he said? Yeah.

1099
01:35:58,476 --> 01:36:01,066
Why, what else is there? Nothing.

1100
01:36:02,596 --> 01:36:03,866
Nothing.

1101
01:36:03,876 --> 01:36:06,946
Look, Sarah. Sarah...

1102
01:36:06,956 --> 01:36:08,906
Uh-huh. Come here. Look at me.

1103
01:36:10,516 --> 01:36:14,346
We need to talk.
Is this about you and me?

1104
01:36:17,076 --> 01:36:19,546
You and me? Grow up, Dave!

1105
01:36:39,236 --> 01:36:41,586
How can you be sure?

1106
01:36:41,596 --> 01:36:43,946
He's not here for
the fuckin' Boat Race, is he?

1107
01:37:01,676 --> 01:37:03,586
Got a light?

1108
01:37:04,636 --> 01:37:08,306
Look, this is all Nicklin. That is
way too much ground to cover.

1109
01:37:08,316 --> 01:37:10,106
We don't have to cover all of it.

1110
01:37:10,116 --> 01:37:14,106
He was 15 years old. He's not going
to bury someone under his patio.

1111
01:37:16,076 --> 01:37:19,226
We need somewhere where a lad
can dig a grave and not be seen

1112
01:37:19,236 --> 01:37:21,626
and it stay undiscovered
for 13 years.

1113
01:37:21,636 --> 01:37:24,546
It's not somewhere
where you walk your dog, a park.

1114
01:37:24,556 --> 01:37:27,026
It's got to be undeveloped land,
scrubland.

1115
01:37:49,816 --> 01:37:52,606
Yeah, spell it for me.

1116
01:37:52,616 --> 01:37:54,886
Dave. Hold on.

1117
01:37:54,896 --> 01:37:58,766
Listen, I want you to do a search on
every bit of undeveloped land here.

1118
01:37:58,776 --> 01:38:02,086
Anything that might not have been
touched in 13 years,

1119
01:38:02,096 --> 01:38:04,206
like scrubland or waste ground, OK?

1120
01:38:08,856 --> 01:38:10,806
Alright? Got it.

1121
01:38:21,416 --> 01:38:24,326
Is this it?

1122
01:38:25,816 --> 01:38:27,766
She's all yours, mate.

1123
01:38:50,416 --> 01:38:52,406
I don't want her on the job. Who?

1124
01:38:52,416 --> 01:38:54,566
Sarah Chen.

1125
01:38:54,576 --> 01:38:58,406
She's alright. The doctor okayed
her. She had an option.

1126
01:38:58,416 --> 01:39:00,166
She came back to work.

1127
01:39:00,176 --> 01:39:03,526
We need all hands on deck to clear
up your mess. She's not up to it.

1128
01:39:05,976 --> 01:39:08,046
Yeah, but it's not your call, is it?

1129
01:39:08,056 --> 01:39:12,166
Sir. We've got a fresh one.

1130
01:39:12,176 --> 01:39:14,886
"Whisky Lima 5-4 to all units..."

1131
01:39:23,496 --> 01:39:25,446
Keep coming.

1132
01:39:27,136 --> 01:39:29,086
Mind yourself.

1133
01:39:31,496 --> 01:39:35,006
Claude Gainer. 42.
He's a Swiss national.

1134
01:39:35,016 --> 01:39:36,806
He worked in the City.

1135
01:39:36,816 --> 01:39:39,046
His wife says he drove out at 6:45

1136
01:39:39,056 --> 01:39:41,526
but we can't find the car.
Keys are missing.

1137
01:39:41,536 --> 01:39:43,886
What about a phone? Switched off.

1138
01:39:43,896 --> 01:39:46,406
But if it's used,
we've got a lock on it.

1139
01:39:46,416 --> 01:39:48,406
Is it one of ours? Could be.

1140
01:39:48,416 --> 01:39:51,646
Characteristic excess -
his brain's been bashed to bonemeal.

1141
01:39:51,656 --> 01:39:55,206
There's not much else to go on.
Tide has washed everything away.

1142
01:39:55,216 --> 01:39:58,166
But it could be Nicklin?
Yeah. It's the right location.

1143
01:39:58,176 --> 01:40:00,286
So they're back together again?

1144
01:40:04,776 --> 01:40:06,726
What d'you wanna do now?

1145
01:40:19,576 --> 01:40:21,526
Sir! Wait.

1146
01:40:31,136 --> 01:40:33,326
Did we find anything
at the crime scene?

1147
01:40:35,856 --> 01:40:39,326
You were in Palmer's bathroom when
Nicklin got there, weren't you?

1148
01:40:39,336 --> 01:40:40,926
Yes.

1149
01:40:42,496 --> 01:40:45,606
Well, the tech report found coke
all over the bathroom.

1150
01:40:47,336 --> 01:40:49,286
Really? Yeah, really.

1151
01:40:50,416 --> 01:40:52,846
And Palmer never snorted coke
in his life.

1152
01:40:54,816 --> 01:40:57,806
So you should just go home
because you're no use to me.

1153
01:40:57,816 --> 01:41:00,486
You don't belong here,
d'you understand?

1154
01:41:00,496 --> 01:41:04,126
We would've had both those guys
if you hadn't been such a fuck-up!

1155
01:41:04,136 --> 01:41:06,046
Sir... Please.

1156
01:41:14,296 --> 01:41:16,486
You're really pissing me off, man.

1157
01:41:16,496 --> 01:41:19,406
You knew, didn't you?
You knew and you didn't tell me.

1158
01:41:19,416 --> 01:41:24,646
What? You knew she was using during
the job and you didn't tell me.

1159
01:41:24,656 --> 01:41:26,366
Yeah.

1160
01:41:26,376 --> 01:41:28,886
I hope she was a good fuck, David.

1161
01:41:28,896 --> 01:41:31,366
How did you know? I didn't.

1162
01:41:31,376 --> 01:41:36,166
Outgoing call from Gaitner's phone.
What? Get a trace on it!

1163
01:41:36,176 --> 01:41:39,006
Who are they calling?
Number's coming through now.

1164
01:41:40,296 --> 01:41:43,286
It's here. They're calling here.

1165
01:41:43,296 --> 01:41:46,126
Patch it through to my office.
And get me a location.

1166
01:42:00,976 --> 01:42:01,926
Hello.

1167
01:42:02,976 --> 01:42:04,886
Martin?
Go, go, go, go.

1168
01:42:07,936 --> 01:42:09,046
Martin?

1169
01:42:11,456 --> 01:42:13,406
Locking onto signal.

1170
01:42:27,776 --> 01:42:29,806
Martin? Yeah.

1171
01:42:29,816 --> 01:42:33,966
He's at the hotel. It's
the hotel. They're at the hotel!

1172
01:42:39,576 --> 01:42:41,446
Shit.

1173
01:42:49,776 --> 01:42:53,086
The girl from the reception desk
only just stopped screaming

1174
01:42:53,096 --> 01:42:54,926
and she said it was Palmer.

1175
01:42:54,936 --> 01:42:57,006
Just Palmer? That's what she said.

1176
01:42:57,016 --> 01:43:00,246
It doesn't make sense.
It has Nicklin written all over it!

1177
01:43:00,256 --> 01:43:03,806
But it's Palmer's turn, isn't it?
Maybe he's learning.

1178
01:43:03,816 --> 01:43:05,726
Phil? I'm at the hotel -

1179
01:43:08,416 --> 01:43:10,366
Yeah, I'll be right there.

1180
01:43:11,296 --> 01:43:15,526
Guv, I need an hour.
What, with Phil Hendricks? Now?

1181
01:43:15,536 --> 01:43:16,846
Please.

1182
01:43:17,976 --> 01:43:20,526
It's all ours, Mart.

1183
01:43:20,536 --> 01:43:25,086
Whatever we want, we just reach out
and we take it. Yeah?

1184
01:43:25,096 --> 01:43:27,006
Cos they can't stop us now.

1185
01:43:30,256 --> 01:43:31,926
I'm fuckin' proud of you.

1186
01:43:31,936 --> 01:43:34,526
What you did today
was fuckin' hardcore. Nice.

1187
01:43:35,776 --> 01:43:37,166
Yeah.

1188
01:43:37,176 --> 01:43:39,126
When I hit him it was...

1189
01:43:41,976 --> 01:43:43,606
Can't find the words.

1190
01:43:43,616 --> 01:43:46,406
Yeah, no need, mate, no need.

1191
01:43:46,416 --> 01:43:49,446
That's what I've been telling you
all along, innit? Huh.

1192
01:43:51,656 --> 01:43:53,606
Could you tell me about Karen?

1193
01:43:57,496 --> 01:44:01,366
Forensics got DNA off the chocolate
wrapper from the Vic Perks murder.

1194
01:44:01,376 --> 01:44:04,326
That was Nicklin's murder. Yeah.

1195
01:44:04,336 --> 01:44:07,166
It's got Martin Palmer's DNA
all over it.

1196
01:44:07,176 --> 01:44:10,326
Palmer's. No one else's.

1197
01:44:12,496 --> 01:44:15,206
Karen got into a -
Blue Vauxhall Cavalier. Yeah.

1198
01:44:18,776 --> 01:44:20,726
You killed her.

1199
01:44:25,056 --> 01:44:27,246
They're at each other's murders.

1200
01:44:27,256 --> 01:44:31,766
You think Nicklin was at
the Bracher murder? It makes sense.

1201
01:44:31,776 --> 01:44:34,886
Palmer may have done it
but Nicklin was pushing him on.

1202
01:44:34,896 --> 01:44:37,606
They can only kill
when they're together. No...

1203
01:44:37,616 --> 01:44:39,646
You had one of them in custody.

1204
01:44:39,656 --> 01:44:42,886
Anyone who can tell us that is dead,
alright?

1205
01:44:42,896 --> 01:44:44,806
No, they're not.

1206
01:44:47,176 --> 01:44:50,326
Karen got into a blue - Stop this!

1207
01:44:51,616 --> 01:44:53,406
'Nicklin killed Karen.'

1208
01:44:53,416 --> 01:44:56,446
Palmer couldn't kill Charlie. Tom...

1209
01:44:56,456 --> 01:44:59,166
You have got to find out
exatly what that kid saw.

1210
01:45:01,096 --> 01:45:02,046
Yeah.

1211
01:45:03,336 --> 01:45:05,286
No lies any more.

1212
01:45:07,256 --> 01:45:09,206
It's true.

1213
01:45:27,376 --> 01:45:29,326
I had to, mate.

1214
01:45:30,616 --> 01:45:31,926
I had to.

1215
01:45:31,936 --> 01:45:33,886
She was coming between us.

1216
01:45:36,496 --> 01:45:39,926
My mum said there used to be
a big house up that hill.

1217
01:45:39,936 --> 01:45:42,246
Really posh. What happened to it?

1218
01:45:49,336 --> 01:45:51,086
D'you wanna see her?

1219
01:46:06,056 --> 01:46:09,246
"Hey." What's going on?
"I've been trying to reach you."

1220
01:46:09,256 --> 01:46:12,086
Tell me, Dave. I'm on my own here.

1221
01:46:12,096 --> 01:46:15,366
They've done another. Who?

1222
01:46:15,376 --> 01:46:18,206
"Our old friend Sean Bracher."
Bracher?

1223
01:46:18,216 --> 01:46:21,766
Yeah. Online about 30 seconds
after you walked out the door.

1224
01:46:21,776 --> 01:46:24,086
I didn't walk.
He doesn't want me there.

1225
01:46:25,296 --> 01:46:28,326
"Thorne will be coming for you
next." Nah, I'll be OK.

1226
01:46:29,936 --> 01:46:32,846
Right. Yeah, right.
Fuckin' boys' club.

1227
01:46:34,416 --> 01:46:37,326
Forget about this place for a bit.
Sarah?

1228
01:46:39,056 --> 01:46:40,086
Shit.

1229
01:46:53,896 --> 01:46:55,846
Now, where is he?

1230
01:47:01,176 --> 01:47:03,126
Can you see him anywhere? No.

1231
01:47:05,856 --> 01:47:07,806
Shall we try his office?

1232
01:47:08,936 --> 01:47:12,166
OK, you wait here, Charlie.
I won't be a minute.

1233
01:47:12,176 --> 01:47:14,766
Hello. Nice to see you.

1234
01:47:14,776 --> 01:47:17,006
I'm so glad you're doing this.
Thank you.

1235
01:47:17,016 --> 01:47:21,406
What is this about? We need a chat
with the boy. It won't take long.

1236
01:47:21,416 --> 01:47:24,166
What can I get you?
Tea? Biscuits? Coffee?

1237
01:47:24,176 --> 01:47:27,286
Listen, help yourself, use the
phone. Ring Maureen if you like.

1238
01:47:30,096 --> 01:47:32,046
You don't know?

1239
01:47:34,776 --> 01:47:37,446
Maureen... passed away
two weeks ago.

1240
01:47:37,456 --> 01:47:39,566
I had no idea.

1241
01:47:40,816 --> 01:47:43,126
Seems like
Tom didn't think to mention it.

1242
01:47:44,256 --> 01:47:46,206
Anyway...

1243
01:48:17,536 --> 01:48:19,486
Mummy?

1244
01:48:21,416 --> 01:48:25,766
Hello, Charlie. My name's Kevin.
Very nice to meet you.

1245
01:48:28,336 --> 01:48:31,086
This is Charlie's mummy, everybody.

1246
01:48:33,416 --> 01:48:35,486
Isn't she pretty?

1247
01:48:36,496 --> 01:48:39,886
We've been keeping this picture
for you. Can I give it to you now?

1248
01:48:39,896 --> 01:48:42,366
Good boy.

1249
01:48:42,376 --> 01:48:44,326
Charlie?

1250
01:48:49,096 --> 01:48:51,046
Thanks, Kev.

1251
01:48:52,816 --> 01:48:56,326
Palmer, M. Attempted murder, right?

1252
01:48:56,336 --> 01:48:58,286
Yeah.

1253
01:49:08,456 --> 01:49:10,406
There and there.

1254
01:49:17,216 --> 01:49:18,686
Cheers.

1255
01:49:19,936 --> 01:49:23,806
Hey, Charlie.
Shall we go and sit down? Hey?

1256
01:49:26,456 --> 01:49:28,086
Tom.

1257
01:49:28,976 --> 01:49:31,206
Sorry. Can I have a quick word?

1258
01:49:31,216 --> 01:49:33,606
Can it wait?
No, no. It'll take seconds.

1259
01:49:33,616 --> 01:49:35,526
Just come here.

1260
01:49:37,896 --> 01:49:42,846
You didn't tell me that your mother
had died. I've got -

1261
01:49:42,856 --> 01:49:46,686
All I've ever asked of you is that
you play straight with me, Tom.

1262
01:49:46,696 --> 01:49:50,606
I think I deserve that. With
respect, it's none of your business.

1263
01:49:50,616 --> 01:49:55,966
Really? It never occurred to you
that it might've made a difference?

1264
01:49:55,976 --> 01:49:58,646
Doesn't affect my work, does it?

1265
01:50:00,256 --> 01:50:02,006
I meant, to me.

1266
01:50:03,616 --> 01:50:05,366
I've gotta get on.

1267
01:50:08,736 --> 01:50:10,686
Hiya.

1268
01:50:13,936 --> 01:50:17,846
I know you told me this before.
I just want to ask you again.

1269
01:50:21,056 --> 01:50:25,046
Have another look at this man.
Are you sure you haven't seen him?

1270
01:50:26,696 --> 01:50:28,646
You sure?

1271
01:50:46,896 --> 01:50:48,846
What about this man, Charlie?

1272
01:50:50,416 --> 01:50:52,606
Did you see him at all?

1273
01:50:52,616 --> 01:50:54,566
Take your glasses off, come on.

1274
01:50:55,576 --> 01:50:58,126
Look at it closely.

1275
01:50:58,136 --> 01:51:00,086
Have you ever seen him before?

1276
01:51:01,096 --> 01:51:04,406
You said there was one man
that night. Sure there wasn't two?

1277
01:51:06,536 --> 01:51:08,486
Were there two men or one?

1278
01:51:09,216 --> 01:51:11,766
One. I already told you.
Yeah, I know.

1279
01:51:18,176 --> 01:51:20,526
You said you only saw one man,
Charlie, but...

1280
01:51:20,536 --> 01:51:24,006
Do you think you could've heard two?
Did you hear two men talking?

1281
01:51:25,816 --> 01:51:30,726
When you were hiding,
did you hear two men talking at all?

1282
01:51:30,736 --> 01:51:32,846
Calling to each other?

1283
01:51:32,856 --> 01:51:35,606
Sure? There could have been
two voices - Tom...

1284
01:51:35,616 --> 01:51:38,446
I think he's given you
the best answer he can.

1285
01:51:45,456 --> 01:51:47,846
Are you tired?

1286
01:51:47,856 --> 01:51:49,846
Yeah, me too.

1287
01:51:52,896 --> 01:51:54,846
Let's go and see my dad.

1288
01:52:02,176 --> 01:52:04,126
Come on.

1289
01:52:23,656 --> 01:52:26,766
Where's the boss? Er, I dunno.
Why? What have you got?

1290
01:52:26,776 --> 01:52:30,246
We may have something. A witness
has come forward from the hotel.

1291
01:52:30,256 --> 01:52:33,366
Palmer took Bracher's car.
Who was running the tracker?

1292
01:52:35,176 --> 01:52:37,326
Sarah Chen. Er, I've got it.

1293
01:52:45,016 --> 01:52:46,006
Sir.

1294
01:52:48,416 --> 01:52:53,166
Sir. I think Sarah knows
where they are. You what?

1295
01:52:53,176 --> 01:52:56,566
Dad, look after Charlie.
Phil, stay here. Tom!

1296
01:52:56,576 --> 01:53:00,366
They're in Bracher's car. Sarah has
the tracker. I pinged her mobile.

1297
01:53:00,376 --> 01:53:03,446
She's got the tracker?
Yeah. She's gone after 'em.

1298
01:53:03,456 --> 01:53:06,286
What the fuck is she doing?
Trying to make it better.

1299
01:53:12,736 --> 01:53:17,006
Can I see your glasses? Do you know
how they work? Shall I tell you?

1300
01:53:17,016 --> 01:53:21,046
Circulate this number. I want
everyone looking for Chen's car.

1301
01:53:21,056 --> 01:53:24,606
Remember when we were at the film.
Did you ever take the glasses off?

1302
01:53:24,616 --> 01:53:26,646
What it is
is two different pictures.

1303
01:53:26,656 --> 01:53:31,206
When you put the glasses on,
it's trick it plays with your eyes.

1304
01:53:31,216 --> 01:53:34,686
The two pictures kind of join up...

1305
01:53:34,696 --> 01:53:37,326
and become one picture

1306
01:53:37,336 --> 01:53:39,846
that looks as if
it's right in front of you.

1307
01:53:39,856 --> 01:53:41,646
D'you see that?

1308
01:53:56,536 --> 01:54:01,046
Where was she when you last pinged
her? Going northwest on Capstock Rd.

1309
01:54:01,056 --> 01:54:04,286
Capstock Road.
Where is that? Show me. Show me!

1310
01:54:04,296 --> 01:54:05,206
There.

1311
01:54:10,376 --> 01:54:13,446
It's in the middle of
the murder zone. It's a dead end.

1312
01:54:13,456 --> 01:54:17,206
Where does it go? Shit!
Look where it leads to. Scrubland.

1313
01:54:19,856 --> 01:54:23,286
I bet that's where Karen McMann
is buried. She's right behind them.

1314
01:54:23,296 --> 01:54:25,766
Phil! Phil!

1315
01:54:38,456 --> 01:54:40,406
Martin! Martin!

1316
01:55:13,316 --> 01:55:15,386
It's the wrong place.

1317
01:55:15,396 --> 01:55:17,346
No, it isn't.

1318
01:55:18,756 --> 01:55:21,426
It didn't look anything like this.

1319
01:55:21,436 --> 01:55:23,826
Well, you went away, Mart.

1320
01:55:23,836 --> 01:55:26,706
You left it.
You didn't take care of it.

1321
01:55:27,596 --> 01:55:30,746
That's what happens
when people forget things, huh?

1322
01:55:30,756 --> 01:55:33,026
They rot.

1323
01:55:33,036 --> 01:55:35,506
They get lost.

1324
01:55:35,516 --> 01:55:37,466
They go under.

1325
01:55:38,276 --> 01:55:40,906
We're nearly there, Mart, look.

1326
01:56:20,956 --> 01:56:24,426
Don't you see?
She's nothing special.

1327
01:56:24,436 --> 01:56:27,386
WE'RE the special ones. You and me.

1328
01:56:27,396 --> 01:56:29,626
Why don't we just get rid of her?

1329
01:56:29,636 --> 01:56:31,506
'You sure about this?'

1330
01:56:31,516 --> 01:56:33,586
We could just leave her be.

1331
01:56:33,596 --> 01:56:35,466
She won't mind.

1332
01:56:35,476 --> 01:56:37,466
Everything stays the same.

1333
01:56:39,476 --> 01:56:41,666
I wanna see her.

1334
01:57:03,596 --> 01:57:07,226
Get off! Get off of me!
Leave me alone!

1335
01:57:07,236 --> 01:57:09,826
Martin! Get off of me now!

1336
01:57:12,436 --> 01:57:15,546
Martin, get off of me!
Leave me alone!

1337
01:57:17,636 --> 01:57:19,386
'Don't touch me.'

1338
01:57:19,396 --> 01:57:22,986
You think I want that with you?
Not in a million years.

1339
01:57:22,996 --> 01:57:25,586
You're disgusting. I hate you.

1340
01:57:28,156 --> 01:57:30,986
Don't touch me.
You're an idiot, Martin.

1341
01:57:30,996 --> 01:57:32,666
You're disgusting.

1342
01:57:32,676 --> 01:57:34,986
'Not in a million years.'

1343
01:57:47,036 --> 01:57:49,266
Backup are on their way, sir.

1344
01:57:49,276 --> 01:57:51,226
Let's get in here. Here.

1345
01:58:00,796 --> 01:58:03,986
Palmer talked about a pond.
That's right in the middle.

1346
01:58:03,996 --> 01:58:06,306
Dave, you go that way,
circle round, yeah?

1347
01:58:29,876 --> 01:58:32,466
'Martin, what are you doing?'

1348
01:58:49,276 --> 01:58:52,026
Put your hands where I can see them.

1349
01:58:56,836 --> 01:58:58,706
Put your hands where I can see them.

1350
01:59:01,756 --> 01:59:03,146
Get up.

1351
01:59:03,156 --> 01:59:05,866
Slowly.

1352
01:59:05,876 --> 01:59:08,106
Put your hands on your head.

1353
01:59:08,116 --> 01:59:10,946
Do it!

1354
01:59:17,716 --> 01:59:19,666
Where's Nicklin?

1355
01:59:24,356 --> 01:59:26,346
Where is he?

1356
02:00:05,436 --> 02:00:06,666
Shit.

1357
02:00:07,596 --> 02:00:09,786
Phil. Phil, the pond was over here.

1358
02:00:11,716 --> 02:00:14,426
Karen's gonna be buried
around here somewhere.

1359
02:00:19,076 --> 02:00:20,466
Tom!

1360
02:00:27,396 --> 02:00:29,346
That's her. Probably.

1361
02:00:29,356 --> 02:00:31,586
They can't be far.
We've gotta find them.

1362
02:00:34,596 --> 02:00:37,786
I knew it. Not them. Him.

1363
02:00:37,796 --> 02:00:40,906
This is Stuart Nicklin.
Right here with Karen.

1364
02:00:40,916 --> 02:00:43,066
Nicklin never killed anyone.

1365
02:00:43,076 --> 02:00:47,146
What are you talking about? Palmer
killed Stuart Nicklin 13 years ago.

1366
02:00:47,156 --> 02:00:49,746
This is him. This is Stuart Nicklin.

1367
02:00:51,236 --> 02:00:53,946
Stuart was inside watching me.

1368
02:00:53,956 --> 02:00:57,306
He killed him, took his personality.
One man, two personalities.

1369
02:00:57,316 --> 02:00:59,466
One dominant-aggressive,
one passive.

1370
02:00:59,476 --> 02:01:02,626
Do you know what it's like
to be really scared of someone?

1371
02:01:02,636 --> 02:01:05,586
Martin Palmer needed Stuart Nicklin,
so he became him.

1372
02:01:05,596 --> 02:01:08,906
Two, four... Lock me away for four.

1373
02:01:08,916 --> 02:01:13,746
'As Nicklin, he was able to kill Karal.
As Palmer, he couldn't kill Charlie.'

1374
02:01:13,756 --> 02:01:16,666
Vic Perks must have worked out
Nicklin was dead.

1375
02:01:16,676 --> 02:01:20,346
And Vic went to meet him. He went
to meet Palmer. Nicklin showed up.

1376
02:01:22,156 --> 02:01:24,786
Shit. Sarah...

1377
02:01:34,876 --> 02:01:36,786
Where is he?

1378
02:01:41,316 --> 02:01:42,866
Call him.

1379
02:01:44,276 --> 02:01:46,226
Stuart.

1380
02:01:55,636 --> 02:01:57,586
Martin?

1381
02:01:58,396 --> 02:02:00,826
Martin...

1382
02:02:00,836 --> 02:02:02,786
This isn't you.

1383
02:02:06,516 --> 02:02:08,466
I know you couldn't kill Charlie.

1384
02:02:10,916 --> 02:02:12,866
And you don't want to hurt me.

1385
02:02:14,836 --> 02:02:17,066
It's been Nicklin
making you do all this.

1386
02:02:18,996 --> 02:02:20,946
Always somebody else's fault.

1387
02:02:22,156 --> 02:02:24,986
Isn't it, Detective Chen?

1388
02:02:24,996 --> 02:02:27,866
Why are you doing this?

1389
02:02:28,596 --> 02:02:31,586
I have absolutely no idea.

1390
02:02:36,196 --> 02:02:38,146
P- Please.

1391
02:02:40,116 --> 02:02:42,066
Please, Martin.

1392
02:02:42,396 --> 02:02:45,146
Oh... Stay there.

1393
02:02:49,316 --> 02:02:50,706
It's OK.

1394
02:02:52,436 --> 02:02:55,106
Come on, Martin, drop the gun
and we can talk.

1395
02:02:55,116 --> 02:02:57,026
Talked to you already.

1396
02:02:58,796 --> 02:03:00,626
I asked you to protect me.

1397
02:03:00,636 --> 02:03:03,026
You didn't listen.

1398
02:03:03,036 --> 02:03:05,546
Yeah, I know. I'm sorry.

1399
02:03:05,556 --> 02:03:07,186
You sorry?

1400
02:03:07,196 --> 02:03:09,626
You said you'd help me.

1401
02:03:09,636 --> 02:03:11,986
You promised.

1402
02:03:11,996 --> 02:03:14,946
I was just bait.

1403
02:03:17,436 --> 02:03:19,386
All this.

1404
02:03:20,556 --> 02:03:23,626
This is all your fault.

1405
02:03:23,636 --> 02:03:25,586
Yes, it is.

1406
02:03:27,116 --> 02:03:29,066
It is.

1407
02:03:30,876 --> 02:03:33,186
And I'll always live with that, yeah.
So...

1408
02:03:33,196 --> 02:03:35,226
You're gonna have to.

1409
02:03:37,796 --> 02:03:39,986
Sarah!

1410
02:05:52,516 --> 02:05:54,506
He looks happy enough, doesn't he?

1411
02:05:54,516 --> 02:05:57,346
I think he is. It'll take time.

1412
02:06:01,036 --> 02:06:02,986
Yeah.

1413
02:06:03,156 --> 02:06:06,586
You don't think it's a good idea
for you to see him any more? No.

1414
02:06:06,596 --> 02:06:08,506
Not for now, anyway.

1415
02:06:09,676 --> 02:06:12,266
Maybe in the future we'll see.

1416
02:06:15,116 --> 02:06:17,066
Yeah.

1417
02:06:18,916 --> 02:06:20,866
Thanks a lot.

1418
02:06:29,316 --> 02:06:32,026
You alright, son? Hm? Here.

1419
02:06:40,796 --> 02:06:42,306
He'll survive.

1420
02:06:45,356 --> 02:06:48,346
Kids can grow through stuff
you won't believe. Yeah.

1421
02:06:52,116 --> 02:06:54,066
It'll all come right in the end.

1422
02:06:57,836 --> 02:07:02,226
You're an optimist, aren't you, Dad?

1423
02:07:02,236 --> 02:07:04,146
Someone has to be.

1424
02:07:06,276 --> 02:07:10,706
I mean, you can't go through life
fearing the worst,

1425
02:07:10,716 --> 02:07:14,866
thinking there's something coming
round the corner to knock you down.

1426
02:07:14,876 --> 02:07:18,706
I mean... You can't go through life
thinking that.
